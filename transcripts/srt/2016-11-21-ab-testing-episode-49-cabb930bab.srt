1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey everybody. Hello. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we are here for episode 48. Wrong.

2
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,150
That was my Donald Trump.

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,580
47.5

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,040
episode

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,460
49

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,000
We're just gonna skip over 48. No, we're not because right now I was waiting till this moment to post it

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,760
But I recorded episode 48 without you

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,320
Okay, then so check it out lean over here for a second, okay

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,760
Here's the picture. I work with three of the three

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,400
The the four of us got together the three of the three and me. Oh, I like that three of the three and me we got

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,360
Vernon Richards has to from tester from from luster. We have Percy, you know Percy. Yep and

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,160
Michael Richards who was salty gunner. Yep. They were all at test bash. We recorded episode 48 together and I'm gonna post it right now

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,260
I was waiting for this moment

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,880
So episode 49 that's one way to make sure we get to 50 this year

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
And I'm not sure we're looking for

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,400
still looking for

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Interesting suggestions on what we should or could do for episode 50. So keep those coming in

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Hey, I just got notified from Twitter that we

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,160
48 and we're recording episode 49 right now and if all goes well, I'll have this out on Monday

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,680
I just got notified tips. What'd you do retweet it? I did

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,560
This is give me the worst podcast ever while we stare at our phones and retweet each other

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,640
So I just got back not just last week a week ago. I was in

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,080
Philadelphia you ever been to Philadelphia? I have not it was my first time to Philadelphia

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,640
great time

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,660
Impressive conference don't hear about it. I do

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,850
All right. I'll tell you I did a little quick little blog post about it. But in short

27
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,490
I read the quick little blog post about it's a single track conference. They do them all the time

28
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,050
the next one is in

29
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,210
His Brighton next I can't remember. Oh, no, maybe I don't know that they're all over

30
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,330
They did these little one to two day. This was the first two day test bash

31
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,520
normally test bash is a one-day thing, but it's a single track conference they

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,180
The one thing that was different from a lot of conferences is that I actually liked all the talks there were

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,780
but Alan

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,700
You don't attend conferences you only present I attend the conferences I present that

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:52,430
So this one I was so happy so Percy posted a picture of Alan sitting in the audience

36
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,630
I'm like

37
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,630
Yeah, you attend these things

38
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:04,910
Was good. I all the speakers top to bottom very impressed one here something weird all talks

39
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,790
Very good. There was one mention of contracts driven testing where I rolled my eyes for the obvious reasons. Yep, but I

40
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:19,110
Liked it. There was one event we came back from lunch on the first day and we talked and this is rehash of what's episode 48

41
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,330
But does it can I say we've talked about this before without drinking if you and I haven't talked about this before I

42
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,220
think so

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,340
So in short the just so you know

44
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,670
there was

45
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,070
This interesting scavenger hunt, but it wasn't like a real scavenger hunt. So we came back from lunch and

46
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,080
We were told all right form some groups of about 10 people and

47
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,320
This guy down here is your product owner and here's a link to a Google map with some sites marked go check them out

48
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,390
Take some pictures take some notes come back

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,180
So it was a scavenger hunt where we didn't know what we were scavenging for

50
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,590
So we visited these places took lots of pictures and we came back and there was a quiz

51
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,590
full of all sorts of random trivia and

52
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,670
Somehow the team I was on tied for first, okay

53
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,150
if

54
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,590
What in general was the point of the scavenger hunt just a building? No, it was interesting there were

55
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,870
I thought in history

56
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,790
I thought it was a

57
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,670
Weird reason to get us out in the fresh air which is great to get out in the fresh air in the middle of a

58
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,670
Commerce right after lunch when it's nap time

59
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,870
But there were some interesting parallels to testing

60
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,450
There were things that people and tell me if this is you haven't seen this before in like bringing a new person onto a team

61
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,310
Mm-hmm. There were Philadelphia natives there and there were people like me had never been there before

62
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,910
There were things that the natives didn't notice at all

63
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,340
But the new people coming in said oh, what's that? Oh, I've never noticed that before

64
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,980
Tell me you haven't seen that in software. I

65
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,540
Test your eyes is what I used to call it

66
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,060
So and I think it was more of a way to get us out and about but

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Doing the sort of scavenger hunt and that what we didn't know what we were scavenging for has, you know dealing with ambiguity in there

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,760
Sure. Anyway fun time. I did have most of a Saturday to walk around and check things out

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,800
I saw the Liberty Bell. I was going to ask it's not nearly as big as I've been led to believe my whole life

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,960
How big is it?

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,970
Four feet tall. Okay and with the bell about the same

72
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:44,830
I was the pictures I saw in my history books. I thought I was this massive like 12 foot tall Bell. It's not maybe it was just me I

73
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,100
want to

74
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,800
Times times tick enough like I have an 18 year old now. I've always wanted to sort of cats in the cradle

75
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Little boy, yeah

76
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,950
Weeds

77
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,070
I always wanted to sort of take them on sort of a history tour of the of the Northeast

78
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,950
Yeah, I love but right now if I can ever actually get him to

79
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,030
Apply to college which he has to do by the end of this month

80
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,200
We're thinking of our big

81
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,950
Brew ha ha for summer is a

82
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,340
Crew someplace. All right. All right. I'd like to go to Washington DC sometime me too

83
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,500
So I am inviting myself to speak at any conference or group in Washington DC

84
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Place I have a band I really like to go to

85
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
all I require is

86
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,300
Flight and like three nights hotel and I'll speak whatever you want me to throw it out there for the three

87
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,100
When do you want to go? Oh anytime?

88
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,790
Anytime maybe before January you want to go like

89
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:10,470
I'm just worried that the city may just implode or explode maybe implode on after January. Oh

90
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,040
We could spin the rest of the podcast if we want

91
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
better not

92
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
We better not

93
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Okay, so you talked to test bash I did I gave a talk it was

94
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,560
testing without testers, which is a flavor of talk I'd give them before but this one was

95
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,360
much much different from the versions I gave previously at QA SIG in Seattle and

96
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,720
When did I give it before then? Oh, I gave another variation of it at

97
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,920
What's that called in Waterloo?

98
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Test

99
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,390
Group SIG up there. So I was following

100
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,430
What was it Twitter or something?

101
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,350
People were posting comments. I had a good Twitter explosion during my talk. I was very happy

102
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,390
I was like coming back from my talk and bringing out my Twitter phone and seeing like a whole bunch of tweets one of the guys

103
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,870
That I read in the way he commented him. I I interpreted it as

104
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,470
He walked away from your talk sort of feeling that

105
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,830
testing without

106
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,830
testers blows and

107
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,260
And that kind of surprised me. No, no, I don't think that's I don't think I was his takeaway

108
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,220
That was a Twitter is a moment in time, right?

109
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,850
So at the risk of getting hammered at 830 in the morning, we've talked about

110
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,490
Way me I'm too tired to hammer wait ways to do

111
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,090
Combined engineering or engineering teams incorrectly

112
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:51,050
So I did talk about the fact that if you just say okay, no more testers everyone's a developer

113
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,130
You're probably gonna fail and that does blow

114
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,180
It does and you will yeah, sure that that moment and that that's the moment in time. He was capturing

115
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,500
Okay, if you do this wrong, it's going to suck if even if you do without a plan whatsoever

116
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,660
It's going to be wrong and therefore it's going to suck

117
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,060
So I talked and again, it could be a rehash of a a B testing episode

118
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,700
But I talked a lot about how you can do it wrong

119
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,660
What the benefits of it are because a lot of inefficiencies in having the siloed teams

120
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,780
I got to imagine it's not coincidental, but I got a spike on the

121
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,780
The unified engineering blog post right interesting right when you were

122
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,640
Good Wi-Fi there people were looking stuff up trying to understand what the connection would be

123
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,230
I don't know. I mentioned unified engineering so they searched your I don't know

124
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,670
Like a precog I don't think you talk about it. Yeah, I don't I don't think you ever did a blog post on my blog post

125
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,510
No, so I'm not certain how they would I don't know

126
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,830
But there are search engines where if you search for terms it may show up things that show up in your blog

127
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,990
Did you call it unified engineering? I did I just said that okay. Jeez. That's how they did it then

128
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:15,510
So anyway, it can be very inefficient to have siloed engineering teams. I talked about how my previous team

129
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,970
Definitely didn't need any testers, but we didn't have any UI

130
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,970
Didn't have anything that needs have any visual verification very easy to do though. Those are those are no-brainers

131
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,970
You shouldn't have a test team test that crap

132
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,160
But a little bit different on my current product where lots of UI

133
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,380
built very quickly

134
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,940
There are some dragons under the covers

135
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,700
We require our and expect our developers to write lots and lots of tests

136
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,900
But we do even though we're technically an engineering team

137
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,460
We have my team that does some quality infrastructure work around diagnostic tools

138
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,620
Making sure test infrastructure is working etc

139
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,500
And then we have a small team of vendors who do manual test manual visual verification sort of testing

140
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,980
So we're not completely testerless

141
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,180
No, you're not by the way last time I was in your building for podcast. Yeah

142
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,560
Ran into one of my former employees who's on your dev team. Who is that?

143
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,480
Ron Hatton. Yes, that's right

144
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Called out here along the world

145
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm sure he's one of your favorites. Ron's good. Yeah, Ron's good

146
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,480
He's working a lot on the mobile platforms now and doing very very well my experience is

147
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,320
people who

148
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,200
Spent a lot of time as Estes and then moved to the dev role

149
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,320
Get this new world much faster and better than oh, is he an estet before? Yeah, okay

150
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,600
Yeah, that's probably gets it and it's weird. I know

151
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,720
Given who's making a change how much I have a gut feeling of how good I feel about it

152
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,390
Most of those people are former testers

153
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,490
Here so there are some of who aren't former testers who are very good as well

154
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,950
But they just see the forest for the trees a lot better

155
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,550
He was one of my ICs when I started down this agile journey in Bing

156
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,040
Very interesting. Yeah

157
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,440
So you've heard the whole story

158
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,040
Dr. Rehash the whole talk was about how it can work

159
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,420
For the problem solving how you get developers to do testing

160
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,720
there was a little bit of organizational change a little bit of

161
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,800
Preparing people who are maybe heading down this path and what it means and how to coach their management on how to

162
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
make this change successfully and

163
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,960
Also just how to coach developers on how to become testers how important that is for

164
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,040
How important of a skill that is for people who are testers today one interesting thing I asked at the beginning

165
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,610
I said how many of you are on a team with?

166
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:03,120
No testers and this one woman raises her hand. I goes so I was going for she goes I cry a lot

167
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,760
It's really easy to head down it's really I think easy to get in that stage where you're just if it's done wrong

168
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,440
you're the only tester and you're and all the crap is flowing downhill to you it can be a

169
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Very lonely and dark and sad place what I'm imagining

170
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Remember back in the days when?

171
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:35,240
Q-tech still existed. Yes the quality and test engineering community. Yep that that Alan was the chair of within Microsoft

172
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,560
Do remember dead you remember the talk? I did it one of the Q-techs on this journey

173
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,880
I'm kind of imagining what you did a test bash is

174
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,600
an equivalent to the talk I did at that one Q-tech meeting where I was

175
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Essentially trying to communicate to the to other test teams at Microsoft the same sort of thing

176
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,130
You remember that are you saying I copy you no because I don't

177
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,960
No, I'm just kidding you know

178
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,080
I do even if you did I'm sure your talk is way better than I do vaguely remember it

179
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,600
Yeah, and it really is how do I take all these skills? I have as a tester and

180
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,980
Maybe it's a survival guy like what if this happens to me? What if my org gets rid of testers?

181
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,060
How do I survive here are some ideas and it turns out there was a consultant there that gave a talk about

182
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,260
Balancing from company to company doing organizational change, and it's actually what she does and what I do are very similar

183
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,550
Going to go into the org

184
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,680
It starts bottom holes and filling them

185
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,970
So are you there a lot of power you now announcing on the podcast to your up-and-coming?

186
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,650
Career as a test consultant. I would except I

187
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,330
Don't want to be a test consultant

188
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Really no desire I

189
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,200
honestly don't

190
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
understand the psyche around those who do

191
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
look

192
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,600
There is an entire industry, and I'm pretty certain that several of our three are

193
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,960
Look, you know look again, and look look once look twice and then look three times

194
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,680
There is and maybe will always be this

195
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,660
Business if you want to there's so much turnover in test and one thing about test bash is the audience is very sophisticated

196
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,660
too a lot of not

197
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,940
Or even called novice but a lot of experienced testers in the audience so they it's easier to get the point across

198
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,060
I don't think I could have given this talk at to a bunch of newbie testers at one of the big conferences

199
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,820
They would have wouldn't have got it at all

200
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,780
But because I'm talking to people who kind of been around the block a lot and they kind of it was a lot better

201
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,540
Received the maturity of the audience helped

202
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
Me deliver the message of my talk

203
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,420
But to finish my other thought because we do on on a B testing is we just bounce all over the place is

204
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,300
that there is a whole

205
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,180
Business that I could work as long as I wanted as much as I wanted

206
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,780
Teaching brand new testers how to test software that will always exist and there that's what that's why test consultants exist

207
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,620
Because there are always brand new people that want to learn testing software. Just like we did it in 1992

208
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,380
Forever I that's boring to me to me. That's

209
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,760
Sad I don't think I could do it would be like

210
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
being a nurse at

211
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,840
Children's Hospital in the fatal cancer wing. I don't think I could do that job

212
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:46,450
Yeah, I'm I'm helping you to kill your career wait wait

213
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:53,570
I just bring a dark downer to everything so so let's let's go back to something more up in in your blog post

214
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,100
You mentioned something that in some regards surprised me

215
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,090
Knowing how tight you are with Lee Copeland

216
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,870
You mentioned that test bash

217
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,470
Might in fact be your official favorite test conference. I think it is

218
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,990
Yes, and what you describe it you describe it as a sense of maturity

219
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,070
But one of the things that that I keep

220
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:28,230
Harping on it on the podcast is I don't think I don't know if it's a set of maturity or a modernization

221
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,710
Right because what it what you described to me feels like hey, this is a test conference about

222
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,390
testing in

223
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,390
2016 not

224
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,650
1992 in many ways yes

225
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,490
But it may be in all ways a couple other things that make it better and nothing and Lee I like you

226
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,010
I like your conferences. They're good for a

227
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,570
people who want to know a

228
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,210
broad

229
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,650
Number of ideas about testing there is four or five tracks going on at once the keynotes are always very good at star conferences

230
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:08,010
The track sessions I at star and Lee actually suggests this you can bounce around from session to session

231
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,130
And I usually do that as a way to get the most value

232
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,970
There wasn't one session. I saw at test bash. I would have left to go see anything else

233
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,450
They're all very good even the ones where I you know

234
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,890
Maybe had a few eye-rolling moments. I enjoyed I thought everybody had a good story to tell some were fantastic

235
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,340
there was

236
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,200
tangent there was one talk by Abby bangs or and

237
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:37,380
Someone she works with whose name I forgotten and they did what I thought was a fantastic talk that could be done at

238
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,180
Not probably even better suited for like an agile conference in a dev conference, but it was they did like a a

239
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,890
play

240
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:52,170
Where it was really cool. They would act out like the talk was about how to treat infrastructure like a real product

241
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,170
But was really about how to they were there

242
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Did a synopsis like a little reenactment of a real-life work interaction?

243
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,080
then

244
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,800
They had a way of like stepping out of it and talking about what was going on

245
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Fourth wall break. Yeah

246
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,600
It was like it was like yeah, it was exactly it was breaking the fourth wall third wall fourth wall

247
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,280
And then they go back into it and then pop out and it was it was done really well

248
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,960
They obviously worked on it a lot, but executed super well

249
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,960
Really really cool. I thought it was a great talk Lee actually pinged me afterwards. I gave him a few suggestions for

250
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
People to invite the star I think there's I think that conference

251
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,080
I think all conferences have their place in an audience are looking for what frustrates me about star is not the speakers and the talks

252
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,040
I get value out of when I go and I go to a lot of talks when I'm there is

253
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,090
how much of star is a

254
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:53,050
How much star is a platform for vendors to try and drum up business for test consultants to try and drum up business and

255
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,010
even though there were people who are officially consultants speaking at test bash

256
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,730
I didn't feel like at any time they were trying to sell me anything or try and get business

257
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,370
Where I really feel almost overwhelmed with that at star

258
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,780
Yeah, I get what you're talking about like

259
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,220
The last conference I went to a strata

260
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
Right and they had different

261
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,660
they they had the tracks that were sort of the sharing is carrying tracks and

262
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,340
the sharing to sell tracks and

263
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,000
the sharing I even think those the sort of

264
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:37,890
Sharing to sell tracks the best way to drum up business would be the soft sell and that is

265
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,210
just show

266
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:48,330
That you are awesome because of of your knowledge and your tooling and show the

267
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,500
Awesomeness in a way that resonates with the people right you do that enough time is playing the odds. You'll get your sales

268
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,780
the

269
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,810
the test bash talks were

270
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:07,050
Almost entirely not entirely almost entirely experiential people were telling their experiences on the job wasn't

271
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:13,370
Very little like theoretical like here's the definition of the word metric and here's how you know

272
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,650
It's like oh god. None of that crap that I ate all very much. Here's an experience

273
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,650
I had at work and what I learned from it and

274
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,930
Here's some things that maybe that I've discovered. Maybe you should know too, which was what kept me engaged in the talks

275
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,060
So kind of a TED model in some ways

276
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,700
Yeah without the strict like Ted you must talk for 22 minutes

277
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,060
Then you're pulled off the stage by a hook and you must but very good everybody's well prepared

278
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,160
I give a lot of credit to Rosie and Richard and whoever else on the staff put together test bash and

279
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,500
Helped prep and choose speakers. I think it I was very impressed

280
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,370
There's an elephant in the room. We haven't talked about

281
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,290
Brent doesn't understand the word metaphor

282
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,500
Or metaphor means I had a great by the way before we get to the elephant in the room

283
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,580
Great metaphor this morning from a mutual friend of ours

284
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,780
there is a

285
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,920
engineering manager a peer of mine on our team who's

286
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,480
Struggling to get the right data for his performance metrics

287
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,450
always frustrated not never can figure out what he wants or the best way to put it and there's and and

288
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:23,030
then the data team is trying to figure out what data he wants and then he says I can't refresh the cube and

289
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:31,300
What what he's doing but not Jim what what this engineering manager is doing is the equivalent of so the metaphor was

290
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,200
He's shopping while hungry

291
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,690
So he's taking he just want he's going into the store and wants everything just give me it all

292
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,290
I'll figure out what I want to make later

293
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:46,090
Which is good for the soul but bad for your diet and checkbook

294
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:51,770
My advice to Jim was says take him to the grocery store teach him at a shop for a sensible meal plan

295
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,230
All right away from metaphors elephant in the room means something we haven't talked about

296
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,070
One week two weeks ago and one week previous to my test bash talk

297
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:10,150
My product was officially announced this thing. We've been talking about as my product is now known around the world as

298
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,670
Microsoft teams whoo-hoo congratulations on the ship

299
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,870
Shipping is a weird word in the new world, right?

300
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Congratulations on your release

301
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,740
announced and I'm still training the congratulations on general availability. No, no GAs later. Oh

302
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:38,010
Okay, but it's weird a lot of people on my team are used to and I've mostly work on

303
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:44,290
Traditional shrink wrap products as well, but the transition has not been difficult for me because I actually pay attention to the real world

304
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:50,570
But there's this I still hear words like okay. What are we working on for v2?

305
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,850
So what's a v2? I don't get it. We ship every week. We ship all the time. Yeah

306
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,110
V2 is that like next Thursday? Yeah

307
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,790
so and

308
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Couple interesting things it'll tie into

309
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,020
We took a little about teams teams is a collaboration platform a lot like slack

310
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,800
Which you can use one of the three dot slack comm to talk about our podcast

311
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,700
But our product is targeted for yes, you can go to the teams

312
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,460
You can sign up to the teams competitor to learn more about teams

313
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,800
exactly

314
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,220
Brent gets it. You can't get the elephant in the room

315
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Selective intelligence. Yeah

316
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
anyway

317
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,400
targeted at office 365 users

318
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,580
So if you're a company that has a oh 365 tenant you can flip this thing on you have a great collaboration tool

319
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,160
it works really well, there's a lot of spit and polish and and

320
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,320
Feel little bells and whistles to put on top, but it's

321
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,000
Coming along so so we're not going to abandon the slack channel anytime soon to go to teams then not soon

322
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,220
But at some point

323
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,220
There's a there's a plan to

324
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:09,930
Not have the oh 365 requirement. I cannot talk about how we're going to work around that but at some point it'll be a viable

325
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,490
Alternative to the slack channel. Okay. All right, let's go there a couple interesting things

326
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,490
I have several questions afterwards, but I'll wait for your interesting things because you

327
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,090
Talk about shipping because one interesting thing I've noticed is we ship all the time

328
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,700
We have seven services and a front end

329
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,340
That ship and all those ship one of the services ships twice a week. Everything else ships once a week

330
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
So that makes nine times a week

331
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,550
seven eight nine times a week we ship

332
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,790
but what's interesting and I'm sure this is not uncommon for

333
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,310
Teams that ship something. There's a front end lots of back end stuff is

334
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,150
from our our team

335
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,440
Most of our team especially like program management and designers and up. They really only care about when the front end ships

336
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,440
Yep, they asked did we ship yet this week? I said we ship on when we actually first thing I say is

337
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,740
We ship all the time. What are you looking for? But do we ship?

338
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,020
So I still do we I we have some new we have new rounded corners in the buttons

339
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,780
Oh did the front end ship the front end ships on Wednesdays?

340
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,900
it's

341
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,780
So yeah, it's not visual. It didn't happen

342
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,810
the question that I

343
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,650
Here's a question that I think you should practice

344
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,040
when they come to you I

345
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,180
What?

346
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,420
Features are you looking to understand when they released?

347
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:45,590
Because it's not a product ship anymore. It's a feature release now. Yeah. Oh and also this is it's getting more confusing

348
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,290
There is you ever seen this you know, you know the move my cheese metaphor

349
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:51,710
Yep

350
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:58,230
Well, I have these confused mice who can't find their cheese because not only do we ship we ship to the world on Wednesday

351
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,310
but we ship to

352
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:07,150
The Microsoft ring on Monday and then to our team for dog food the previous Thursday. Okay, and

353
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,280
Is it the same mice that are confused the mice just can't follow?

354
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,740
It's like rings of deployment are confusing. Let's not do that. I said

355
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,080
I'm too scared. I see my head shaking here. Like yeah, I'm too scared to not have rings of deployment

356
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,900
Yeah, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it that way of Mike. Okay

357
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,190
Let's sit down and figure out how I can help you

358
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,200
Get be less confused. Do you think I have time to sit down with these people?

359
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,560
You don't have time to deal with them pushing back every day

360
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,640
I'm being slightly facetious here. All right, you have some questions you fire away. Yeah, so

361
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,560
142

362
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
long strings and

363
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,390
The average. Oh

364
00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:01,630
That's right. Not jeopardy. Good. Go ahead and start over in terms of your designers and your PM's I guess that's that's

365
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,420
not too surprising when when

366
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,080
When I went to power bi and help them walk through it though, we

367
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,580
We were very

368
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,260
Planful and proactive so I didn't experience

369
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,320
When we finally started doing our regular continuous deployment

370
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,340
I did not experience this same phenomenon that you are with your PM's

371
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
because

372
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,220
We told them upfront. This is how it's gonna work now over and over again

373
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,380
the biggest impact though was on the dev side and so I'm curious as to

374
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,130
how live site handling might be working now or

375
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,510
Have you seen any behavioral change?

376
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:51,940
Within the dev team, I'll give you I'll give you a rough number here like

377
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,780
My dev team

378
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:05,650
Lately they're they're essentially expressing that live site activities DRI

379
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:12,650
Which stands for designated responsible individual the person who answers the phone right?

380
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,160
that

381
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
overall live site activities is

382
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,680
taking up about 50% of

383
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,540
Devs time now. Yeah ours one thing that helped us with that is

384
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,200
We even when we're only shipping we weren't really shipping. We had only our team was using it

385
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,460
We had the DRI process in place

386
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,560
So we had weeks and weeks and weeks and months and months of practice

387
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:47,940
Going through the DRI path before we even had any real customers and then as we slowly added customers

388
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,700
They were very used to it. We definitely have more issue. We're cleaning up a lot of

389
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,140
Monitors and when you're the DRI right now, it's pretty much full-time. You're figuring out what's wrong and tweaking stuff

390
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,060
we also have a small team dedicated to

391
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,620
site reliability engineering or SRE and those people

392
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,460
Very much following the Google SRE model were 50% of the time they're they're coding and running diagnostic tools, etc

393
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,180
And then 50% of the time it's sort of helping and coaching the bailing out sometimes the DRIs

394
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
but our

395
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,640
One thing we're doing pretty well. We have I was incident manager this week

396
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,360
And I still am until this afternoon

397
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,540
And I didn't get any calls this week. Everything that was picked up by the DRI which was good

398
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,460
Are you tracking uptake?

399
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:42,000
Like what's the usage? We're up to well over a hundred thousand active users

400
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,370
So on our way up, okay. I am looked at the numbers that they probably higher than that we've had

401
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:53,210
thousands and thousands of tenants turn on and a lot of people just turning on small parts of their tenant or or

402
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,690
Like the IT admins generally will have like a test tenant. They'll play with they'll turn on for their company

403
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,170
But it's a more uptake than I planned

404
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,930
We've had a couple set of ones

405
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:12,210
A few set of two is a lot of threes and fours which are actually mostly monitoring glitches

406
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,170
But some we're learning to filter the noise from the real issues as we finally have

407
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,810
Something close to real traffic. You're on top of Azure. Yeah, we are

408
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,230
Okay, we're entirely on top of an Azure. We depend on you very much

409
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Send me your subscription

410
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,780
The the other thing that would that would be good if you have your own monitoring

411
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,220
And if you don't it's a top of MDM

412
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:45,490
No, no, no, no Microsoft stuff. Yeah, but one thing that would be extremely valuable to us here is

413
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,480
If you had your own monitoring, we're on your own not relying on our data, but on your own

414
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,780
Determine outages that you would blame Azure on okay interesting as Brett and I bring up work stuff in the podcast. Yeah

415
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Last weekend before last

416
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,800
Tell me that brings a bell we had all kinds of failover in East US

417
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:15,860
There was a big outage in East. Yeah. Okay. All right correlation. So but which is actually really good

418
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,340
For us because we had manually tested failover

419
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:26,100
But it was good that automatically those things were rerouted to West US and and in particular

420
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,200
My team is really looking for is an internal team that

421
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:38,560
Monitors the availability and reliability of their own service independently from Azure data and

422
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,470
attributes out their own outages to Azure

423
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:51,470
Independently. Okay. So if you have that or something like that, yeah, I want to talk. All right. I will connect. Yeah

424
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,990
Well, oh shit. We're doing a pocket better together

425
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,990
I

426
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,680
Mean yeah, we're talking business on the podcast, but

427
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:12,280
This is all about how how to use data to even improve quality even better, right? If I can take your data

428
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,920
Connect it with the Azure data and change certain behaviors here because you're independently measuring this

429
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,080
I can improve my platform which then improves yours

430
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,050
Sounds good. Yeah, follow up

431
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:34,610
Back to what we're talking about teams and deployment and teams and you said SRE live site

432
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:40,590
So you're saying you haven't seen much of a behavior change yet with dev because you've already

433
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,410
Yeah, not much not trained them beforehand. I think

434
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,130
Yeah, we train them beforehand. They're acting pretty well. They know where they're

435
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,330
We're yelling at about the same things and they're slowly getting better

436
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,250
Our we had a lot of noise in our monitors, but we knew we had noise that's getting better now

437
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,250
Could we have traffic we can believe it?

438
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:06,210
I like having more users because the numbers start making sense around, you know, but we look at perf latency and errors happening

439
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:13,160
We can start to actually know what's going on in the world. Have you started?

440
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,460
Trying to fake out a B testing

441
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,670
That is definitely on that is our about experimentation not Alan Brent testing, right?

442
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,830
Experimentation slash B

443
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:32,890
That's definitely the goal. We're not quite there yet. We're not quite to the stage where you're my

444
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,170
One of my goals is everything's an experiment. Let me ask you this. We're not quite there yet. Let me ask you this

445
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,170
There is I'm gonna assert this

446
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,600
That there is at least one feature

447
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,400
That you and a PM argued about that you lost

448
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:02,510
It shipped and now you have the data to determine who was right. Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Have you done that yet? Not yet

449
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,600
Do it then you need help. Let me know

450
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,640
I've been busy with the other part of my job, which is getting getting crap out the door not crap getting

451
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,720
quality bits out there the second you can get the

452
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,320
It's a huge opportunity to get your PM's now

453
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,760
understanding

454
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,680
What this data can be used for and to start?

455
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,280
Start the the journey we actually talked about in

456
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,280
Episodes 45 through yeah 40 whatever no and I've definitely applied a lot of that and we are getting there

457
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
But we are just getting

458
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,880
Our flooding system hit the ground hot

459
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,470
So we're still ironing out some things there. It's getting better and better but

460
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,990
absolutely experimentation is on the short-term radar and

461
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,950
looking at data to

462
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,630
Looking at the data to see what's being used and how it's being used or not

463
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,590
And I'm saying you don't need experimentation to begin your drawing the intuitionists. I

464
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,870
like that the intuitionists

465
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,350
Which both of us are very much driven off of intuition

466
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:15,430
And there's I did a tweet well, I'll paraphrase my own is it paraphrase and paraphrase myself

467
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:20,830
I can't remember exactly what I said, but the tweet is much more profound than I'm about to speak right now where I will say

468
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:28,390
The the root of your killer features is I thought it would be cool if it's probably not

469
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,430
Right, and I've seen just a lot of a lot of dead ends there

470
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:39,430
Yep, because we are intuitions. Oh, you know what our customers really need. You know what they need

471
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,930
They need a pink theme. Oh

472
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,920
For sure. They gotta have the pink theme. It's really important. I talked to my daughter and teams team should automatically integrate with lift and uber

473
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,960
That would be so cool if that could happen

474
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,320
We have a lot of third-party integration we and I could just see that yeah

475
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,520
We need a tab for lift we have imagine like slack channel

476
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,940
We have tabs or you have different functionality like a VSTS tab, etc

477
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:17,550
Right visual studio team system and then we give them for a lift like you go to the tab to order your lift ride

478
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,600
If you mention that to someone on my team like a PM they might do it and then I punch you in the face

479
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,310
So which PM

480
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,190
How do you know I mean it's

481
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,270
Interesting to do an experiment actually the way you do an experiment is you do an experiment is you say?

482
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,170
All right, let's give them a lift tab very low. See if they use it. Oh, they don't use it

483
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,840
Must be because it wasn't pink enough. We'll make it pinker any other questions about teams and deployment and things

484
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,270
I should be doing better

485
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,510
No, I think the I think the next part of your data culture

486
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,990
Journey is is is going to be

487
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,670
Introducing PM's to a better way. Yeah, if you're if your ops are there

488
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,540
Right the the other thing I would recommend

489
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
So if you're doing a traditional

490
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,960
DRI approach with TSG's and you have an SRE team whose entire job is to

491
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,060
Identify and put out fires, but not necessarily put out the fire starters. Mm-hmm, right?

492
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
then

493
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:33,090
You should start paying attention to what TSG's are being actively used

494
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:39,470
You should ask that you should ask your SRE to keep track of the TSG usage stats

495
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,540
Because those are things

496
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,490
That you should get your dev team to automate now. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea

497
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,280
I will do that one thing

498
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,080
I don't know if this is common or not, but it made a lot of sense to me

499
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,160
I want to talk about briefly is talk about deployment

500
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,080
So my team owns everything for the moment code is checked in till it goes to the customer

501
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,780
So a lot of quality and testing is in there as well as you know, check in tools gates, etc. Build, etc

502
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,810
One thing I've done recently

503
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:17,810
Before we ship but maybe a last month about month or so is we get everything deployed to the Deadpools

504
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,730
No Deadpool is good movie. So

505
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:27,290
Everything's ready. The bits are live or ready to start routing traffic to new whether it's back-end server stuff or a new front-end

506
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,610
I let our SR. I don't let I

507
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,030
I

508
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,950
Passed at that point. I'm done with it

509
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:38,110
I give it to the SRE and the SRE actually routes traffic and does that move because they can

510
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:44,310
They know how to watch the monitors and see what's going on and when to roll back or make those choices, right?

511
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:49,670
So that's been very helpful because then I feel a little felt like I'm passing the buck to them

512
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,950
I've said this is

513
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,670
Like this is ready to go but you know better if it's not or if it's something's gonna go weird

514
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:01,090
And we have for better for worse one thing we've learned over the last two weeks is how to roll back

515
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,410
Good. Yeah, I'm like a roll back very effectively

516
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,970
quickly that is some

517
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,490
One mistake I see a lot of teams do is that when they start going into the service world

518
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,850
They don't have a plan

519
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,570
for

520
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,730
Rollback and when you're in this world, right?

521
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,450
Which which then reinforces this this preventative?

522
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,880
Test model which directly harms your ability to do continuous deployment

523
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,320
Mm-hmm, which is the which is another one of the places I want to get to you

524
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,800
We're not we're we're rapid deployment, but certainly not continuous deployment. Maybe not even rapid. What should I call it frequent?

525
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
semi-frequent often deployment

526
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,200
So that's that's really good news the my team right now is

527
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,180
Working one of our key missions is to apply data science towards

528
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,090
the NRT

529
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,250
DRI life site type problems

530
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,810
Azure is growing very rapidly

531
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:18,490
I'm not going to mention numbers here. It's highly competitive space but

532
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,450
What our predictions show for what's going to happen in the next five years is

533
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,350
unlike

534
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:34,180
Anything we've experienced thus far and so I'm helping to lead on helping

535
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,930
to get our assets

536
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
scaling to that

537
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:49,220
Should be a fun adventure the more the more and more I think about it. We've talked a lot on on here around

538
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,200
Shifting to out agile is important because of calendar time, right?

539
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,420
That's something that the Azure team fully is bought into

540
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,870
But what's happening next the next target is engineer time

541
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:10,610
Right, we can't have

542
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,010
50% of our engineers

543
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,710
You know

544
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,710
Just focused on putting out fires

545
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,670
Absolutely, correct. So I'm very excited about this stuff

546
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:28,470
It also it is also exciting that I can say hey

547
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:35,190
Alan start thinking about this that'd be good to do. Yeah, we rely a lot on Azure everything's yeah

548
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,070
Okay, as you can imagine

549
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,070
Okay, this has been episode

550
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,710
49

551
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,270
Apparently so

552
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,310
Sorry, brant man. I blacked out of all 48

553
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:51,900
So we'll be back next time for the big 5-0, right? I guess

554
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,020
All right, it's been a hell of a time. We'll see you next time
