1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,940
I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we are here for episode 50.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,260
50. Five zero.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,820
Sequenta. The golden anniversary. Brent, I got you a present.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,500
Did you? No. Yeah.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,340
By the way, before we go on, thinking of presents, like...

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,460
Why would we go on? You couldn't have even gotten me coffee.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,300
Like what the hell? How do you work in this building with a broken coffee machine?

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,100
I use my little itty bitty legs and I go up the stairs where they have two coffee machines.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,300
That's a good solution. Yeah.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,660
Except for the whole going upstairs.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,980
I'll tell you what. The B and AB testing is not for brains.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,740
It is also not for burning unnecessary calories.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,780
So...

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,660
So, did you ever think, once upon a time, years ago,

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,740
Brent and I would give each other crap in these test architect group meetings,

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,820
which really kind of sort of touch wine fests and...

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,740
Which was really the start of this.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,420
It was like Michael Hunter or somebody said,

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,780
you guys should record your conversations.

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,220
Said, yeah, we'll do a podcast.

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,380
Those were amusing.

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,460
And then we started one and then we...

23
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,750
And we still have one.

24
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,790
So, let's get going.

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,790
One comment we had after the last podcast, which was episode 49.

26
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,110
That was essentially Debbie TF on the TLAs.

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,670
Yeah, Debbie TF on the TLAs.

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,710
TLAs, those three letter acronyms, those abbreviations that every corporation flies around.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,710
One, I don't know if you changed jobs.

30
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,550
It's been a couple of years now.

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,990
But whenever you go to a new job, people start talking and they all understand each other.

32
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,630
And you go, what the heck are they talking about?

33
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,750
It took me a good three months on the current job to get up to speed on the TLAs.

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,070
Yeah, and sometimes...

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,230
Now I'm generating them.

36
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,510
It gets a little ridiculous.

37
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,270
So, let's see if we can remember all the ones we talked about.

38
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,270
So, we mentioned SRE.

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,150
Yes, Service Reliability and Engineering Team.

40
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,980
Typically, Site Reliability Engineer,

41
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,780
which is what the term came from, the role was invented at Google, where they call it a

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,220
Site Reliability Engineer.

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,820
And actually, I can really recommend Google's book on Site Reliability Engineering.

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,300
That's the name of the title.

45
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,900
I'll have to ask...

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,500
I say the name of the title.

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,010
That's the name of the book, the title of the book.

48
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,960
It's a good book.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,720
I have to ask my SRE team what he calls the S.

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
Yeah.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,560
Pretty sure it was Service Reliability.

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
That's the problem with TLAs, is they can morph, right?

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,040
You know, the thing is, they can morph.

54
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
Like WTF is...

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
But in this case...

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,840
It could mean what the fudge or where's the fire.

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
Windows Test Framework.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,080
Yes, exactly.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,400
If I would have written it or if James Woodaker wrote in that book would have been called

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,220
How We Do Site Reliability Engineering at Google, but you know.

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,900
Yeah, I have no clue.

62
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,140
You have to speed on what James is doing, Lillian.

63
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:30,060
James is a professional talker to peopleer.

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Yes, I know that.

65
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,060
That's pretty much it.

66
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,060
I had lunch with him last year.

67
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,060
Once a year he writes...

68
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,860
He starts doing PR for a new thing of how to be awesome.

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
What ifs.

70
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,860
What ifs.

71
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,180
He's being James.

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
Yes.

73
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,780
Another acronym we threw out.

74
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
What's another one we...

75
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,260
There were DevOps, there were TSGs.

76
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,620
Okay, DevOps is...

77
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,620
DevOps is pretty...

78
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,220
It's not really a TLA, it's just an abbreviation.

79
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,260
I thought DevOps is pretty well known.

80
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,430
You can search that one.

81
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,750
TSGs, troubleshooting guides.

82
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,030
I actually listened to them episode and put it on the Slack channel.

83
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,030
DRI.

84
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,790
DRI, designated responsible individual.

85
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,550
Which is a dumb acronym, but it's caught on at Microsoft.

86
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,190
It's the guy that answers the phone when the site goes down.

87
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,950
Yeah, it's interesting though.

88
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,830
Someone says DRI and no one calls it the DRI.

89
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,630
Anyway.

90
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
That's not interesting.

91
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,690
It is to me.

92
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,770
Usually when you pronounce an acronym people say crap.

93
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,770
Oh, GA.

94
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,650
Our product will go into GA sometime next year and that's general availability.

95
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,880
We used to call that RTM, but it's...

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,240
We don't really release to manufacturing anymore.

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,520
They called it RTW, released to web for a while, but now GA, the term is like, it's

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
available.

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,830
You can use it.

100
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,300
All right then.

101
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Any others?

102
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,070
Did we get them all?

103
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,750
Yeah, I'm sure people will tell us if we have them.

104
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,750
I know.

105
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,830
I'm sure we'll fire a few out here.

106
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,830
So we had...

107
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,870
Is this a mail bed question?

108
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,870
Essentially.

109
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,190
So on the Slack channel, so the next topic...

110
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,190
What the f***?

111
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,020
Mail bed!

112
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,950
Now you can go on.

113
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,860
All right.

114
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,300
Man, you are just making your editing job so much harder this episode.

115
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,620
You know what?

116
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,430
You would not believe how hard it is.

117
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,110
Have you automated the scanning of the use of F words?

118
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,990
No, but me dropping a few F bombs is nothing like editing out your coffee slurping and

119
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,010
sniffling and coughing and microphone fondling.

120
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,030
You're not warmed up yet.

121
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,470
Brent is now eyeing his microphone stand seductively.

122
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,030
Whoa, Mikey.

123
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,060
Hey baby.

124
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,380
All right.

125
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
Can we go into the topic?

126
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
I've been waiting.

127
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,540
All right.

128
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,140
Salty Gunner and H.E. Gold.

129
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Henry, I believe.

130
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
Yeah.

131
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,140
Yeah.

132
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:27,300
One of the topics that resonated with them on episode 49 is essentially your rant on

133
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,570
your PMs asking you, hey, when are we going to ship?

134
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,570
When are we going to ship?

135
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,570
When are we going to ship?

136
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:42,130
And the sense that only the front end shipping is the only thing that matters.

137
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,320
And it occurred to me, and I wrote it in the Slack channel, I'm like, oh, crap, I was too

138
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:57,970
busy joining Alan in the man PMs or stupid party.

139
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,690
And realize that, no, there's actually, there is a solution.

140
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,320
It's not simple because it's a system problem, but there's a solution.

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,000
And I said, okay, well, we can certainly attempt to talk to that on episode 50.

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,600
Well, talk about your solution and I'll talk about mine when I feel like interrupting you.

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,110
Okay.

144
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,110
All right.

145
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:28,940
So first and foremost, why are the PMs all hot and bothered about shipping the experience?

146
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,620
Is that a rhetorical question?

147
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,340
Like me to answer, go ahead and answer.

148
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,380
He was expecting the answer rhetorical.

149
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,020
I was expecting rhetorical.

150
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,360
There's in general, it's because it's visible.

151
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,120
It's that, and I'll go ahead and go into my part of the answer here is there's a

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,800
nice, I like quadrants and diagrams.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,440
There's a quadrant of visible and invisible and features and bugs or, or we'll call it

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,200
bugs for now, but you have visible features.

155
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,200
That's, you can see it.

156
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,440
It gives me new value.

157
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
It's really cool.

158
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,480
You also have visible bugs.

159
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,920
Oh, this doesn't work right.

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,480
Then on the other side of the quadrant, you have invisible features, which are

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,000
architecture and things underneath and how you do your protocol handling, et cetera.

162
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,000
And then this whole pile in the corner of, uh, and actually, actually the services are

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,560
kind of there too.

164
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
They're not visible features.

165
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,360
They're super important, but they're not visible.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,240
And then in that bottom corner where you have invisible, uh, bugs is just where

167
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
your tech debt lives.

168
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:35,730
Right.

169
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,690
So, uh, but this is all an engineering perspective.

170
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,330
What about from a customer perspective?

171
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,050
Customers don't care whether you have two services or 12 services or 150

172
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,690
services, they want their pretty little UI to work.

173
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
More importantly, they want their problem solved.

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,280
Like, and if the pretty UI doesn't solve their problems, then they're not

175
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,400
going to use the pretty UI.

176
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
You are correct.

177
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,640
Right.

178
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:08,180
The, um, for once the quality from a customer point of view, it's, it's as,

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,480
as all of our listeners are well aware is, is multifaceted.

180
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Um, but first and foremost, customers want their problems solved.

181
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,990
Right.

182
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,350
We were talking about teams, right?

183
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,830
What's some of the, what's the number one hypothesis for, for a customer

184
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,990
solution for teams?

185
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,580
Rephrase your question in the form of a question I understand.

186
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,900
What problems does team solve for customers?

187
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,260
Uh, team collaboration.

188
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,480
Okay.

189
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,560
Or team digital collaboration.

190
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,320
Right.

191
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,930
Your product is an experiential product.

192
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,690
Correct.

193
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,250
Right.

194
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:04,010
It is not like a SQL server or any actual server product where, where the

195
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,050
architecture itself is the solution to the problem.

196
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,010
The architecture in your case is an implementation towards a problem solution.

197
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,210
Sure.

198
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:13,730
Right.

199
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:21,580
Um, in a nutshell, why PMs are all hot and bothered about this is because

200
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,820
it's the experience that settles the product.

201
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,620
No, I agree.

202
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:25,980
Right.

203
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,120
Now, the other thing that was talked about a lot in the Slack channel is,

204
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Hey, uh, they're cramming in a bunch of features.

205
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
Uh, the architecture can't stand that up.

206
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,420
Right.

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,060
We have six months.

208
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,300
I'm now making up stuff, but we have, we have six months of work to put

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,780
into our back in order to be able to handle the scale for, um, the front end.

210
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,540
Right.

211
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:01,020
And it's when I saw that, that, that longterm thinking around what the

212
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,340
plans were for the backend in the hypothetical example on, on the

213
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:13,940
Slack channel, I realized, Oh crap, this is a be def big design up front.

214
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:23,940
What appears to be super common is still, uh, to design your architectures with a big

215
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,860
design up front with the architectural layering model.

216
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,980
And what doesn't appear to be common yet is sort of how to adapt the system.

217
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,880
Uh, the system of developing product so that you're delivering vertical

218
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,120
slices, uh, in an emergent design fashion.

219
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,140
You are correct in the general sense.

220
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,860
There are other dynamics on our team that for job preservation, I won't go into,

221
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,860
but in general, that's why these things, that's why these views come this way.

222
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,180
Yes.

223
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:58,620
Yeah.

224
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,060
So it takes a lot of effort.

225
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:11,860
I like, uh, the, there's two real good sources, uh, combined together that really,

226
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,830
uh, help people understand the direction.

227
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,190
It's a system problem.

228
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:23,830
So, so there's no real magical do this and, and that stuff happens.

229
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:30,690
Um, but if you, if you look at Eric Reese's book, something we've talked about a lot

230
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,570
here, we have as well as, um, pretty much anything from the pop and dikes.

231
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,570
Oh yeah.

232
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:45,270
Um, and if you can connect the dots between these two topics are these,

233
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:51,350
these two, um, subject matter experts, then and connected to the context of your

234
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,190
business, you should be able to move forward.

235
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:59,110
I can go into more detailed examples, but you read Eric Reese's book couple times.

236
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,390
Do you remember the concept of a concierge MVP?

237
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,190
Yes, I do.

238
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:12,870
It's called a concierge MVP because the only thing that is solid is the front end.

239
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,560
They, they bolt on the back end on a as needed basis, but a lot of the, a lot of

240
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,320
the stuff is literally the guy behind the curtain.

241
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:31,360
So there, there will be people in some, I failed to remember the concrete

242
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,480
example from, from Reese's book.

243
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,960
But essentially if you go to teams and there's something that's supposed to,

244
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,760
there's experience acts like it sends an email, but that's actually not hooked up.

245
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,760
Then there would be a physical person behind the scenes that sends the email.

246
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,600
Okay.

247
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,520
Now, why is that important?

248
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,210
It's important because when you ship these services, at least in Reese's concept,

249
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,530
you're trying to come to a decision on, are we going in a valuable direction?

250
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,370
Okay.

251
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:10,850
So having, uh, um, shipping an MVP to a couple hundred people and having one

252
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:18,970
guy for a couple of weeks forward emails manually is cheaper in the grand scheme of

253
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,570
things.

254
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,370
It's a way of seeing if they want to send email, if they're going to use it.

255
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:23,730
Right.

256
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,250
It's a cheaper way to evaluate that.

257
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,090
Right.

258
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,090
Um, and it's the same thing with a lot of the data database

259
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,850
architectures are expensive.

260
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,370
No, no, I get that.

261
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,650
And that makes a ton of sense.

262
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:39,730
You want to, uh, the part I like about that a lot where we've honestly failed

263
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,730
in a few cases is, which is a little, when you're doing this sort of a V one thing,

264
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,500
it can happen a little bit more, but we want to, I totally believe that you just

265
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,340
don't get value from your engineering effort until the customers have validated

266
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,620
and tried out what you're doing.

267
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,180
And so if you need to hack together some things on the backend or have a guy

268
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,460
behind the curtain, given that experience, see if it works, it's great.

269
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,460
Yes.

270
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,280
There where we've, uh, there's a term I've used for that.

271
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,680
Probably can't, I can use it on the air, but when you are building a product

272
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,450
and it's all for yourself and you keep on adding features and features, but

273
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,090
they're really things that you want and you've never validated them.

274
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,130
You know what I call that?

275
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,620
What technical, we'll call it self-satisfaction because you really,

276
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,340
you're just, and, uh, seriously, if you're not using the customer, if you're not

277
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,530
involving a partner, you're just playing with yourself, right?

278
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,650
It's, it's not the most appropriate metaphor, but it's the one that comes

279
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,890
directly to mind when you're just focusing inward on trying to make a product

280
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,050
and thinking just in your own mind that it's the right one for customers

281
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,850
without getting any validation from them.

282
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,090
Yeah.

283
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:11,450
It reminds me of the data phase that Steve Rowe, uh, invented on, on the

284
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:18,010
episode of a few episodes back, which is the, the data affirmation phase,

285
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,330
which is I only trust the data as long as it agrees with me.

286
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,160
Ah, yeah.

287
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,220
Right.

288
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,800
Um, wouldn't you also call that confirmation bias?

289
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,320
It's absolutely confirmation bias.

290
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,140
Um, I just noticed that we, that's one thing.

291
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,660
That's why to do it.

292
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,140
That's what, that's what Reese's thing is saying.

293
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,340
Hey, there's an ROI here, do what's cheap to figure out whether or not there's an,

294
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,260
there's a viable investment.

295
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,480
Now the pop and dyke, um, principle that I want to pull in.

296
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,080
I like that the pop and dyke principle.

297
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:06,500
Um, is so Mary in particular lists out seven different principles around

298
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,780
what makes something agile.

299
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,020
And, um, but her principles aren't, that's not quite right.

300
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,730
It's, it's sort of principled rules of how to go about agile.

301
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,810
And one of the ones that I'm most fond of that I, that resonates with me on this

302
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,790
topic of emergent design is something known as deferring commitment.

303
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:40,510
And what that specifically means is from a, from a technical standpoint,

304
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:51,010
you defer any major decisions until the last possible responsible moment.

305
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,330
Yep.

306
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:51,930
Absolutely.

307
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:52,490
Right.

308
00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:00,510
And, um, an example, um, when I first introduced this to my first agile team

309
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:08,840
when I was in bank, um, I had a whole bunch of developers coming to me saying,

310
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,450
Hey, Brent, I was thinking about this design and I would like to add this

311
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,850
thing because somebody might want to one day fill in the blank.

312
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,930
That just then shivers up my spine.

313
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:27,570
I actually, I actually, um, when I, when it had occurred with enough of my staff,

314
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,970
I pulled together a team meeting and I said, all right guys, from here on out

315
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:38,130
anytime someone comes to me with, with anything that contains the words, someone

316
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,130
might want to just realize that the answer is no, think, think about what

317
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,090
you're trying to, to actually ask for.

318
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,530
And then here's more than likely my, my response.

319
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,050
Okay.

320
00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:00,520
Um, I told them, um, pointing them out to the defer commitment and I said,

321
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:08,900
what this means is we're not going to implement anything under the premise

322
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,580
that someone might want to one day.

323
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:21,940
We, um, as I, as, as you know, anyway, um, part of how I do agile before I can

324
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,180
declare done, we do a process called customer validation.

325
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,120
So we actually go talk to the customer and validate that we, that the reason

326
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,840
why we built it is, um, it's solving the problem that we intended it to solve.

327
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,640
And we do that by not theorizing by actually talking to a customer or looking

328
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,640
at instrumentation, but I said, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, Hey, you

329
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,710
might be right, but you are not to implement it.

330
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:59,890
What you are to do instead is re-arc the design of your, uh, what you're

331
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:07,640
doing right now, such that if you are proven to be correct, we can shift

332
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,880
to that design and moments.

333
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,640
Sure.

334
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,440
Right.

335
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,520
So it's about making the architecture adaptable.

336
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,080
Had a very similar conversation yesterday.

337
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,840
We had someone come to our team and say, Hey, we need to do this feature by, uh,

338
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,040
we own a little bit of the product features around, uh, how we deploy rings.

339
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,360
And without going into details, someone came from one of the team said, Hey,

340
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
we really need to build this feature.

341
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,560
Cause customers are going to want it.

342
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,240
And immediately my team's well-trained.

343
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,990
I mean, even the most junior guy on my team says, what customers are asking for

344
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,560
this and they said, well, no customers are asking for it yet, but

345
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,440
they're going to want it.

346
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,030
How do you know they're going to want it?

347
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,390
Well, because we think they need it.

348
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,710
These are, I mean, actual quotes and it's so well-trained.

349
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,830
He says, okay, let's do this.

350
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:06,190
Let's, uh, go ahead and not do anything that will block this from happening,

351
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,910
but let's just hold this for two weeks.

352
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,750
And we'll see if any questions come in about this, it's all ready to go.

353
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,430
We can turn it on, but there's definitely more important work to do right now.

354
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,830
So let's just not do this now until we know that it's really needed.

355
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,050
Right.

356
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,250
So it was perfect example.

357
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,900
It's like, and in my case, it's like you have this mountain of stuff.

358
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,660
I know you need to do, I know why are you even asking about how are you often the

359
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,300
weeds of, I, we think customers are going to need this because I have work.

360
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,900
I know that is much more important.

361
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,780
We don't have time right now for, for you thinking about what customers want.

362
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:55,160
There is, um, wait, you don't want to, you don't want to completely shut down.

363
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,560
Exploratory ideas.

364
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,480
No, no, no.

365
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,800
Which is not what you're saying.

366
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,320
You're saying it remains in the backlog.

367
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
It will remain in the backlog.

368
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,220
And, um, what, uh, actually I'm glad you brought up backlog.

369
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,660
So backlog grooming is, is a key part of being able to improve this,

370
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,020
this front end problem.

371
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,610
Um, by, uh, by having it.

372
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,650
So for example, there is this system called W S J F weighted

373
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:34,170
shortage job first, you can look at W S J F on the internet and figure

374
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,970
out the equation.

375
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,330
Okay.

376
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:42,480
Um, but it's very equation driven that then the key aspects of it is it

377
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,280
cleverly combines time, criticality, business value, and the cost of doing

378
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:59,430
the work so that you have, you can then order your backlogs by business ROI.

379
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:08,620
Um, and dynamically the, um, in this particular case, when you go through a

380
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,790
backlog grooming, right?

381
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:18,680
Uh, the scenario you just brought up, um, we would revisit it in that couple

382
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:29,640
of weeks and plug in a new business value number if we have proof of some

383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,440
degree that, that this is something that's viable.

384
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,560
One of the advantages again, to echo what we talked about previously and Eric

385
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,710
Reese is now that we have customers and a few hundred thousand of them, we,

386
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,270
it's much easier for us to make those decisions and see, is this really

387
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,070
something customers are asking for versus something I think they're going to want.

388
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:59,880
And of course, uh, someone will always come back with, well, if your Henry

389
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Ford would have worked that way, you just would have got faster horses.

390
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:12,500
Henry Ford's quote is, uh, if we gave people what they wanted, what they

391
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,620
wanted or no, no, if we asked people what they wanted, they would have

392
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,740
said faster horses.

393
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,140
Right.

394
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,380
Right.

395
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,060
Right.

396
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,400
But, um, I get, so that's, that's used as defense for this.

397
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,160
Well, we need to, we need to innovate.

398
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,530
I'm, I'm a lot like Steve Jobs.

399
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,170
So I want to, that's what I say.

400
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:31,450
Yeah.

401
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,210
Yeah.

402
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:41,240
So customer data trumps intuition every time.

403
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,240
Well, and the thing is, is that you don't have to make it in us versus them.

404
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,680
Like the, my answer to that would be, Hey, look, we have a system in which

405
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:57,080
we are going through and we're building things in terms of a validated ROI

406
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,360
for the business and we're working on most ROI for the business first.

407
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,240
So you know what?

408
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,920
Sorry, your item.

409
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,800
Great idea, dude.

410
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,080
Even if it's a stupid idea, it's always best to say great idea.

411
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,520
However, the situation is this is intuition driven.

412
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,880
These other ones that are data driven are higher priority.

413
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,760
And one day maybe we'll work through and we'll only be working off of

414
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,360
intuition driven ones and yours will be top of the stack, dude.

415
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,160
Um, but do you lie all the time to your employees?

416
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,410
Uh, that's not lying.

417
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,360
Yeah.

418
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,680
One day we're only going to do intuition based features.

419
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,520
I said maybe.

420
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,940
Um, it has never occurred in, in any period of time that I've seen in my

421
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,770
career, um, the, but the other thing too is, but you know what?

422
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:03,750
One of the things we really need to do as a team is make it low friction to get

423
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,390
this data on these, these fantastic ideas.

424
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,550
Like this guy's trying to come up with an argument.

425
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,910
He's got an intuition.

426
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,710
He's kind of using the old school waterfall way of getting this on the

427
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:23,740
backlog and you're basically saying, yeah, that, that ship don't sail anymore.

428
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,380
You can't get to where we're going from where you're at.

429
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,910
We can beat this dead horse a lot, but it was just, this one wasn't, it was,

430
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,400
it was a great idea here and I'm holding up my tunnel vision, uh, glasses.

431
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,080
Uh, one challenge we talk about systems thinking a lot here and this particular

432
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,280
problem, um, particular solution, particular feature, looking for a home,

433
00:26:49,680 --> 00:27:00,060
uh, there were, uh, scale and distribution and test ramifications that were a huge part

434
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,580
of making this change that just weren't thought of.

435
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,960
So there was, there was more to it.

436
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,760
But the, the, the issue is, is that this guy is trying to get it booked in the end.

437
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,120
Yeah.

438
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,560
And what the, where I would have pushed back on that is say, no, let's figure

439
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,080
out how to do, um, uh, a spike in a prototype.

440
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:30,280
Let's figure out how we do a, a low impact AP test of, of whether or not customers

441
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,080
will actually value your thing.

442
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,360
So this is where I would have, I would have take you have a hundreds of thousands

443
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:45,240
of users now, how do you, how do you AB tests with just a few thousand and do

444
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,680
something concierge to prove out this feature.

445
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,000
Sure.

446
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,840
And then the next thing is how do you make AB testing a feature for your product?

447
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,360
And how can you tell via some sort of monitoring or what's your metric?

448
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,440
What's your KPI to determine the business value of doing this?

449
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,760
Is this, how is this providing value and how are you measuring that value?

450
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,600
Yeah.

451
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:12,550
The, um, I actually have this discussion with, with my own team quite often.

452
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:20,030
Now, um, we spend a lot of time building pilots and prototypes.

453
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,080
Okay.

454
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,770
Cause, um, much for the same reason, like I, one of my most used speeches is the

455
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:37,120
pivot or persevere speech, the, we will build prototypes and I have every now and

456
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,120
again, I have a couple of people on my team going, this, the performance of this

457
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
is going to blow and the scale of this is going to blow.

458
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,400
We really should spend the next three months and I'm like, stop.

459
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,040
We don't know anyone's going to use this.

460
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:58,530
So let's get, I get that, that you want to build something that you're proud of.

461
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:03,250
And I want you to build something that you're proud of, but let me ask you, if

462
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:09,090
I spend those four months and we release this and we found, found that no one uses

463
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,000
it, have you built something that you're proud of?

464
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,640
It just makes my heart sink.

465
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,000
I'd be, I just feel like I would, that that's depressing.

466
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,920
Yes.

467
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,780
I'm like, no, let's, let's, um, get something out there.

468
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,300
Let's be transparent in terms of what it is.

469
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:35,660
Let's find a set of early adopters that are, that aren't allergic to, you

470
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,620
know, bugs or perf issues, and let's prove that this is something that, that

471
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,020
solves a problem before we go and solidify it.

472
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,520
Right.

473
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,640
And we will, right?

474
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,480
That's, that's the other thing.

475
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,280
And you also have to be careful that you don't have too many prototypes in

476
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:59,000
flight, um, that you can't scale to solidify the ones that prove out to be

477
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
positive, right?

478
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,200
That, that ends up just creating this hordes of technical debt.

479
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,060
Indeed.

480
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,580
Hey, I want to go on to another subject.

481
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,140
That's okay.

482
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,940
Yes.

483
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,660
You all right with that?

484
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,220
Yes.

485
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,980
Let me just pause here a second.

486
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,580
All right.

487
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:23,290
So while you're doing that, what I'll say in a nutshell is concierge MVP realize

488
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,890
that the experiential stuff is important.

489
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:33,090
Uh, on backlog grooming, one thing I didn't mention is, uh, I have a rule on my team.

490
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:41,660
Whenever we go through a backlog grooming, no more than one third of the total cost

491
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,660
of the team can be on pure architectural.

492
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,240
Okay.

493
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,040
Cause pure architectural isn't what improves the brand.

494
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,560
Correct.

495
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,240
All right.

496
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,720
Okay.

497
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,360
Hey, do you remember?

498
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,680
No.

499
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,120
Yeah, you're almost as old as I am.

500
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:04,550
Do you remember, uh, a long time ago, I gave you some questions off

501
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,350
of a test certification quiz.

502
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,880
I do not going to do that today.

503
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,840
Uh-huh.

504
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,160
But instead I have some questions off of a sample CSM certified

505
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,480
scrum master test for you.

506
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,390
Okay.

507
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,310
Looking forward to it.

508
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,670
It's a 10 question quiz.

509
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,590
I'm going to skip the ones that have long answers just for brevity.

510
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,030
Okay.

511
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,750
But, uh, we'll kind of go through this.

512
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,910
Um, are you ready, Brett?

513
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,300
I probably play along at home.

514
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,820
Feel free.

515
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,500
Write your answers.

516
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,300
These fill in the blank, multiple choice, multiple choice.

517
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,100
Oh, that's fantastic.

518
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,940
He's a multiple choice.

519
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,380
And we'll go over your answers and then we'll go at the end.

520
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,140
I think we get, uh, like, uh, some explanation.

521
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,660
Okay.

522
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,220
Okay.

523
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,940
Some are pretty easy.

524
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,500
Um, involving the team in planning and estimating and providing early feedback

525
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,500
on delivery velocity is best used to mitigate what kind of risk schedule

526
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,500
flaws, requirements, creep, employee turnover, or poor productivity.

527
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,090
All right.

528
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,050
Do that one more time.

529
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:12,610
Involving the team in planning and estimating and providing early feedback

530
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:18,670
on delivery velocity is best used to mitigate what kind of risk schedule

531
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:24,710
flaw requirement, creep, employee turnover, or poor productivity schedule.

532
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:35,060
Question two, which of the following is the best approach for estimation?

533
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:43,550
Expert opinion, analogy, dis-aggregation, a combination of all of the above.

534
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,350
Dis-aggregation.

535
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,070
That's the word on here.

536
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,780
Expert opinion, analogy, dis-aggregation, a combination of all of the above.

537
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,390
I have no clue what dis-aggregation means in this context.

538
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,950
So I'll just go with, uh, expert.

539
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,470
I mean, the right answer is probably combination of all the above,

540
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,870
but I'll go with expert opinion.

541
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,720
All right.

542
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,550
Uh, this is a horribly designed webpage.

543
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,930
Um, this question is too long.

544
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,530
I'm skipping it.

545
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:27,260
When forming an agile project team, it is best to use, I'm going to, I'm going to

546
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:32,500
give the answers out of order, uh, best to use top management officials, highly

547
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,300
specialized developers, generalized specialists, or all of the above.

548
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,330
I'll go with generalized specialists.

549
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,040
What was the first answer?

550
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,200
The top generalized specialist was the first one.

551
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,400
So I know his top executives or some crap.

552
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,600
Yeah.

553
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,880
Top management officials.

554
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,680
Yeah.

555
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
On a scrum.

556
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,800
Yeah.

557
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,880
Uh, this one's fairly easy.

558
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,080
Scrum would have you fire those people.

559
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,680
What is the unit of measurement that is used to measure the size of a

560
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,640
user story for agile projects?

561
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,040
Function points, story points, work breakdown points, velocity points.

562
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,960
Story points.

563
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,160
Yeah, that one was pretty easy.

564
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,120
I should have just skipped it.

565
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,430
Okay.

566
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:21,220
Uh, how is agile planning different from the traditional approach to planning?

567
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,820
Agile planning is done only once agile planning is non iterative.

568
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,280
Agile planning places emphasis on the plan.

569
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,360
Agile planning places emphasis on planning and is iterative.

570
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,810
It's the last one.

571
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,370
Yeah, but it's not on the plan.

572
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,410
It's on planning.

573
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,210
Yeah.

574
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,420
That one's long.

575
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,890
Oh, so far, this isn't as funny as the ISQT thing.

576
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,330
Wait, this is the one I wanted to lead up to.

577
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:51,770
Okay.

578
00:34:52,250 --> 00:35:00,220
The process of testing delivered or quote, done, done stories is known as unit

579
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:07,040
testing, integration, testing, exploratory testing, or release testing.

580
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,780
Given the non sequitur between the answers and the question, I'll

581
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:17,300
read the question again, the process of testing delivered or done, done

582
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,180
stories is known as unit integration, exploratory, or release testing.

583
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,380
I will say in that list, it's probably release testing.

584
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,280
And dear God, I hope the correct answer isn't unit testing.

585
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,230
Now I'm going to skip the rest of it and look at the answers and discuss.

586
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:38,750
All right.

587
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,790
You've reached the end of the quiz.

588
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,830
I'm done.

589
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,870
Ooh, I skipped a bunch.

590
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,550
We got 40% right, but I skipped a bunch.

591
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:46,870
Okay.

592
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,710
I think we did well.

593
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,750
Um, the first one we got right involving the team and planning and

594
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,750
estimating, blah, blah, blah, is best used to mitigate schedule flaws.

595
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:56,950
Well done.

596
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,570
And for which of the following is the best approach for estimation?

597
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:08,290
It was an answer, the answer all of the above this aggregation.

598
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:08,970
I need to look up.

599
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,490
Does it, I see there's a lot of words there.

600
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,930
There's a source that comes from a Mike Cohen's agile

601
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,090
estimating and planning book.

602
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,560
Okay.

603
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,660
This aggregation is probably the process of taking a large story and

604
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,220
breaking it into smaller pieces.

605
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,820
So, um, at which point in time, I agree.

606
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,180
Yeah.

607
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,020
So when forming an agile project team, it is best to have general,

608
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,860
generalized specialists as any listener of the podcast, any of the three,

609
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,540
all of the three know between those options.

610
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,860
But what I didn't know is, uh, there's source for that specialized

611
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,220
generalists who would even be better.

612
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,180
There's source for that is a book that I haven't read by, uh,

613
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,140
Michelle sliger and Stacey abroad, Rick called the software project

614
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,820
managers bridge to agility.

615
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,270
It's in that book.

616
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,750
Nope.

617
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,870
I will take a look at it.

618
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,590
Story points, of course are correct.

619
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,190
That's also from Mike Cohen's agile estimating and planning book.

620
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,870
Um, and the planning one also same book, same answer.

621
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,590
Very good.

622
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,000
Uh, we skipped that one.

623
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,960
Now here's the one that this came up on Twitter and I thought, what the F,

624
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,080
cause I've read this book that they cite the process of testing delivered

625
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,160
or done, done stories is apparently known as exploratory testing.

626
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,020
And so then this is, this is where the tangent happens.

627
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,500
They cited, uh, James Shores book, the art of agile development.

628
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,980
Which I have read.

629
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,740
Okay.

630
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,740
And I went back and looked at it again.

631
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,020
Not well known in the ET world as a.

632
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,260
No, no, no.

633
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,620
He, that book is really good.

634
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,620
Cause it talks about using expert testers for exploratory testing to help

635
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,780
figure out, to help with things and where they can plug in.

636
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,340
And, and the authors of this test made this huge freaking leap that,

637
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,980
oh yeah, done, done is the, is the act of exploratory testing, which is this.

638
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,800
Massive leap in kind of the wrong direction.

639
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,520
So it's just a weird, again, the rest of the test wasn't too bad.

640
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,760
It wasn't as crazy as the, as that test certification, but this question,

641
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,640
no, it's, and that's just weird.

642
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,120
It's just weird, right?

643
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,680
So luckily James Shore.

644
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,160
Um, so what happened?

645
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,400
Uh, someone on Twitter posted this and said, this books, this book

646
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,920
doesn't get exploratory testing implying that.

647
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,560
And I replied and James Shore was on the tweet and I replied back and said,

648
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,280
I don't think it actually says this.

649
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,280
James Shore says there's no way in hell it says this.

650
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:39,640
Yeah.

651
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,160
That book is, I don't know if you've read the art of agile, his book.

652
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,920
No, it's I like it a lot.

653
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,160
I think it's really, really well done.

654
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,280
It's a nice holistic systems approach to the art of agile development.

655
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,480
The art of agile development.

656
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,650
That seemed like a book that would be up my alley.

657
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,090
Yeah.

658
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:57,770
I should take a look at it.

659
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,890
Um, easy to read.

660
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,650
I like it, but explore it.

661
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,290
Tori.

662
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:01,850
No.

663
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,600
So the, so first and foremost, like you just talked through like on,

664
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,210
on Shores book, he's like, uh, no, I should not be cited as the proof

665
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,690
that this answer is correct.

666
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,090
Right.

667
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,610
But the other thing from a scrum side, right?

668
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:23,210
It does the text there say, Hey, you should hire expert testers.

669
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,530
No, not here.

670
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,890
Uh, James shore talks about the, how the value of expert testers, uh,

671
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:30,330
okay.

672
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:36,010
In because agile development, anybody other than a dev on a scrum team

673
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,730
is sort of anti scrum.

674
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,060
It's one of the reasons why I don't like scrum.

675
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:47,420
Um, but, um, exploratory testing in this context, like telling a bunch of

676
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,860
devs to go do exploratory testing.

677
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,220
Um, sure.

678
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,140
It's useful.

679
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:58,220
But how, how do you declare done done from that befuddles me?

680
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,980
So, but there's a logical foul scene here.

681
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,620
I forget which one it is, but Prince having tea drinking problems.

682
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,340
Yes.

683
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:15,340
It started off with having tea, set a coffee, stupid building.

684
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,380
Could walk up stairs.

685
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,180
So earlier we're talking about Eric Reese's, uh, lean startup book.

686
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:28,260
And it would be the equivalent of me reading that book, seeing something

687
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,100
about, I have to think of a good concept.

688
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,060
I can screw up from there.

689
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,200
Um, hummingbirds see what the hell.

690
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,940
So I read about the concierge MVP and, and from that I make, oh,

691
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,960
services don't matter.

692
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,520
We just hire people on the, what we're going to do is we're going to hire a

693
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,040
team of people on the backend to take care of everything on the backend.

694
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,000
We're only writing a UI.

695
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,140
Right.

696
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,580
Like this massive, no, that's not what I meant.

697
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,940
We are going to create the UI and connected straight to mechanical Turk.

698
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,340
Oh crap.

699
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,260
Yeah, that'll work.

700
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,260
That's a good idea.

701
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,580
It's like, yeah, you obviously glossed through here.

702
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,580
And, and again, I, it's a sample test and I give the test writers a break,

703
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,060
but I feel bad you're taking the CSM tests.

704
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,580
You get to that question, you go, what the hell?

705
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,220
Yeah.

706
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:35,280
I mean, the thing is, is that most of these as, as, uh, so you know, I'm

707
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,700
certified and so a lot of these certification tests are essentially how

708
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,700
well can you regurgitate the class that we taught you?

709
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:52,200
So it'd be interesting to find the slide deck, um, for this test.

710
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,120
That presents the material in the first place.

711
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:00,440
Cause I'm sure there's a strong chance that the ET that they've listed here

712
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,560
is not the same sort of ET that we think of in the test community.

713
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,800
No.

714
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,720
And again, having read the book, I know it's just like, it's mentioned a lot.

715
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,440
It's, it's brought up in very good way.

716
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,160
It's not like it's over abused or abused wrongly.

717
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,160
Uh, it's just a weird leap there.

718
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,920
And it almost sounds like they had different, because it's a sample test.

719
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,400
It could have had different people running questions.

720
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,490
I'm not sure what happened, but some cray cray went on for sure.

721
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,330
For sure.

722
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:25,770
I will.

723
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,410
And we didn't answer any other ones, but I really wanted to lead to that one.

724
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,800
So I, um, uh, I found the test, I found the testing question, which was not set

725
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,040
it on the internet, but I know how to use search engines.

726
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,640
So I found the right test and I wanted to kind of get to that question.

727
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,080
That was my, that was my goal for the day.

728
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,440
Not as much.

729
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,040
Well done golf club.

730
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,640
I'm going to, I'm going to ask you one more question.

731
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:43,920
All right.

732
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,680
Then we're going to get out of here.

733
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,680
Which of the following is not one of the five core risk areas

734
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,000
common to all projects?

735
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,760
Really?

736
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,960
I should have you list the five core common risk areas, but which one is not

737
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,920
specification breakdown, scope creep, strategic alienation, and intrinsic

738
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,720
schedule flaw.

739
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,660
All right.

740
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,620
Let's not one of the five core risk areas.

741
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,060
So let's do one at a time.

742
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,900
What's the first one specification breakdown.

743
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,300
That is a risk area scope creep for sure.

744
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,580
Risk area strategic alienation.

745
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,740
Have no frigging clue what that is.

746
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,980
Intrinsic schedule flaw.

747
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,970
That's a risk area as well.

748
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,090
The way I interpret.

749
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:29,730
You're correct.

750
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:34,450
The reason I brought this up, like if you are looking, if you're like, have a

751
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,110
nerd band, like, you know, a lot, you know, a nerd band, like angry weasel.

752
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,390
No, no, a nerd band.

753
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:45,690
Like, like you, it's like bad synth rock kind of stuff.

754
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,410
These are your band names.

755
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,290
Like Flakossegal.

756
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,370
Ladies and gentlemen, specification breakdown.

757
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,410
God, strategic alienation.

758
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:55,810
Rock on.

759
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,530
Everybody wears scope creep.

760
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,570
This is called lover love radar booger knocker.

761
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,380
What do you would that's the long ass blurb there explain what strategic

762
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,420
alienation is?

763
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,460
No, it's just a made up word.

764
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,820
These, this is the disadvantage of multiple choice.

765
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,900
What tests are there are, you don't have to know the answer.

766
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,580
You just have to have critical thinking.

767
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:28,540
Right.

768
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,540
But in my case, I'm picking the thing that I I'm like, yes, yes.

769
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,540
No clue.

770
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,660
Yes.

771
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,100
Okay.

772
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,140
Let's go with no clue.

773
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,740
And they picked like a, I don't even know what that means.

774
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,500
I can't fathom what that means.

775
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,870
So alienation means rejection.

776
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,190
Yeah.

777
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,150
But I'm doing it strategically.

778
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,910
So I'm going to strategically reject like features.

779
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,310
Like I'm using my strategy to reject this work.

780
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,290
Reject.

781
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,130
I don't know.

782
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,690
Maybe customer pruning like, Hey, you can't prune the customers.

783
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,680
No, but you can.

784
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,680
It's not nice.

785
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,600
You can target.

786
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,920
You can say, Hey, we're not going to try to solve all problems for all people.

787
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,760
We're going to solve.

788
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,920
Um, some of the problems for some of the people.

789
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,720
There's a phrase I use often nowadays at my current work.

790
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,210
It is way better to make 50% of the people, a hundred percent happy than a

791
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,250
hundred percent of the people, 50% happy.

792
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,210
Absolutely.

793
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,450
That makes sense.

794
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:32,730
Yeah.

795
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,620
And that's not a risk.

796
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,140
And if that's what strategic alienation is, it's definitely not a risk.

797
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,800
It's a go forth and alienate strategy things.

798
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,360
Cool.

799
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,920
Hey, a question for you.

800
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,320
Yeah.

801
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
Have you ever taken electronics class?

802
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,120
I think the safest answer for me to say is no.

803
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:57,920
All right.

804
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,920
Cause I feel like mocking is coming.

805
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,040
Yeah.

806
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,440
Brent just laid his phone on top of the microphone wire.

807
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,160
So that buzzing you just heard is thank is thanks.

808
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,880
Thanks to Brent.

809
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,720
Oh, gotcha.

810
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,710
You'd be great in a band.

811
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,670
You should join strategic alienation and be like their sound guy.

812
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,140
Right on.

813
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:26,820
All right.

814
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,620
Okay.

815
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:28,660
We are done.

816
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,940
We did 50.

817
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,060
I think this is probably our, I think we do one more this year.

818
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:34,580
Yeah.

819
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,740
And we have to do, um, we will do our best of 2016 show.

820
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:39,960
Right on.

821
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:48,030
Well, we'll talk about our favorite podcast blogs and celebrity presidents.

822
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,260
Yeah.

823
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,340
Something like that.

824
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,490
Okay.

825
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,090
I am.

826
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,250
Bri not Brit Allen.

827
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,200
Yeah.

828
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,280
And I'm Brent.
