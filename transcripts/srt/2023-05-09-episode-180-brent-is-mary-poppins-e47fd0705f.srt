00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,420
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,850
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,650
I thought I'd just be quiet at the beginning and see if Brent said anything.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,650
I was ready.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,650
I know.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,650
Hey everyone.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,090
Welcome to the ABC testing podcast.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,530
Our special guest chat GPT is not attending today.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,370
Um, maybe next time, maybe next time, but always for there for inspiration.

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,690
I was surprised someone actually grabbed one of my quotes out of the podcast and tweeted

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,530
it something about your chat GPT is my collaborator, which it is my friend.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,170
Unfortunately in my life and where I'm at in the world and post pandemic chat GPT is

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,870
likely my best friend.

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,730
And you can take that to be just about as sad as it sounds.

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,290
I got a couple of things.

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,050
Maybe before we get into that, um, is there anything new, exciting?

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,890
Oh, let's talk about in terms of, in terms of friends, are you still employed?

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,010
I am still employed.

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,010
Awesome.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:24,020
Um, I will say that one thing that's interesting on that one, uh, not surprising to you

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:32,060
in some regards to GPT is a great ally friend to, to data scientists and everyone around

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,060
the world.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:41,660
Uh, but if you are running a data science team and you specialize in NLP, GPT also represents

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,860
a great threat to your value proposition.

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,340
I always be prepared to find a new value proposition.

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
Nobody's.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
Oh yeah.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,340
Yeah.

31
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,620
I mean, I've been hearing about jobs going away due to computer programs, whether it's

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:05,020
automation or AI for as long as I've been in tech, yet people seem, most people seem to

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,820
remain deployed and move and shift as needed.

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,500
The thing I'm doing right now, I'm kind of dumb with AI.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,380
I'm kidding, but I'm speaking on behalf of our listeners.

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,620
It's going to move hot and fast, right?

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,180
Our listeners, you should expect to hear about it for a while because things are, are still

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,140
going very hot and fast.

39
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:38,060
But for me, I kind of treat this very similarly to how I did, how I treated it when we made

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,980
the last transition and probably the one before that.

41
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
No.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,270
So I kind of think of it very similarly to, to discussions we knew and I had when it

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,870
was very clear to both you and I, right?

44
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,350
That no, like the metaphor I use is, is test is like a chicken that just got its head cut

45
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,350
off.

46
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,480
From afar, it doesn't look dead, but it's dead.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Right.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,000
We, we saw, we noticed that the momentum is now unstoppable.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Test is going away at Microsoft.

50
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,600
We both predicted this very accurately.

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,810
I don't remember your situation in particular, but I do know that.

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,810
That was fine.

53
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,810
No, I mean, in terms of, so I predicted it and I remember predicting it and saying, oh

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,650
yeah, it's absolutely going to happen in the next three years.

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,570
Welcome to episode 23 of the AB testing podcast.

56
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,170
Right.

57
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,050
I was wrong on that.

58
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,530
I mean, my prediction was correct.

59
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
Not that much.

60
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,730
But it happened in one year, not three.

61
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,730
Yeah.

62
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,370
And, and I'm kind of feeling the same thing right now.

63
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:57,230
So very similar to what I did in test as I started investing myself and my team in a direction

64
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:09,130
where we are still strong, but doesn't try to live in a world where GPT doesn't succeed

65
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,690
in mastering NLP.

66
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,130
Let me, I don't, I don't want to have this conversation yet again.

67
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,890
I will talk about the metaphor and it, it is very similar.

68
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,690
And what happened when companies moved away from having dedicated testers and were very

69
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,010
successful on it is that those that.

70
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,570
Grasped on to the moving car when I'm, my metaphors are going out the window here,

71
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,570
but those who survived and did very well and thrived in that change were the ones who

72
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,690
embraced the change and figure out, okay, we're trying to move faster.

73
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,930
I'm going to figure out how to help the team move faster, accelerate the achievement,

74
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,650
shippable quality, the people who are just, just, I just want to do algorithms all day

75
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,130
and blah, blah, blah.

76
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,210
It's really kind of a fixed mindset, right?

77
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,730
Same with the old testers fixed mindset, digging their heels in.

78
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,570
I do one thing.

79
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,090
I do one thing only.

80
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,570
If you embrace it, if you use AI to enhance what you do and what you do is an AI,

81
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,810
you bring value to the team using ML and AI tools.

82
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,050
You can still do that in a different way using some of these tools to help you

83
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,050
embrace it, lean in, have an open mind, and you'll be successful.

84
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,650
And this is true across any one of 50,000 different similar transitions.

85
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,650
People, I mean, you can go back in business magazines back to the fifties

86
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,170
and you'll find people saying, ooh, business automation is going to get rid of

87
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,330
the need for blah.

88
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,290
And it did kind of, but what it did was it enabled people to do really cool things.

89
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,090
I remember back in 1997 or so, driving to work, listening to KISW before it

90
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,370
turned into a crappy station and someone called in and was like, hey, I'm working

91
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,010
it wherever and we have some mechanical machines coming in.

92
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,650
I'm going to take my job away.

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,450
I heard that and I heard, yeah, you can look at it like that.

94
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,570
Yeah, I was going to take my job away.

95
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,970
What's really going to happen is that it's going to give you time to do

96
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,690
something more interesting than moving part A from shelf A to shelf B all day

97
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,050
long. So anyway, let's talk about something far, far more interesting.

98
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,690
Okay.

99
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,880
Let's talk about me.

100
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,400
I just kidding.

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
I thought it was a good transition.

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm going to go back and forth between old job and new job a little bit.

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,080
I already have people on, I should get to my new gig, my NBC Universal gig here

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,280
in a second, not go too deep into it, but I already have people, including my

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,410
boss. Well, I'm not sure what's worse.

106
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,250
Brent interrupting me with the NBC chimes or Brent talking with his hands

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,050
completely covering his mouth.

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,450
I'll let you all figure it out.

109
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,090
So many people, including my boss, listen to the podcast.

110
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,450
Got to be careful what I say.

111
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,170
My boss is on your new team.

112
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,130
Yeah. And don't and Steve, turn the mic off.

113
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,810
He just a raging idiot.

114
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,210
I'm kidding.

115
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,740
He's actually really good.

116
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,580
I should, I should drop a link to his blog sometime, which I'm on the podcast

117
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,380
sometime now. Now I was going to give him an idea.

118
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,260
Oh God. Anyway, but before you get there, so Steve,

119
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:32,730
Steve open invite anytime you are welcome on the podcast.

120
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,330
So unfortunately I read in the news this week and then a bunch of people

121
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,610
reached out to me.

122
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,170
Actually I saw, I found out about it.

123
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,180
Unity did its third round of layoffs in a year.

124
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,980
So they had cut from about 8,000 now down to about 7,000 employees in a year.

125
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,100
Do some math, figure out that, or that percentages it's a, it's 12.5% whatever.

126
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,940
And so that's tough.

127
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,060
And all the management books tell you everything you study says,

128
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,820
you got to do the, if you have to do layoffs and there's lots of studies

129
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,340
that say layoffs don't even do much for the bottom line, but do one deep cut.

130
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,340
These three semi deep shallow cuts is, is really rough on my routes.

131
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,580
I feel really bad for my old employees, but then they did a thing I kind of want

132
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,620
to talk about a little bit and that one of the things that, okay,

133
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,370
here's a weird thing.

134
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,930
When I decided I was ready to look for a new job,

135
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,810
I was ready for it to be a six month, the 12 month search.

136
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,430
Cause I wanted to be picky and there was a bunch of things I wanted.

137
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,060
I wanted a manager. I liked, yes, Steve, I like you.

138
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,980
I wanted to people I liked working with Steve, please don't tell the people on the

139
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,660
team. I like working with them and I'm ready for that yet. And then three,

140
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,460
I wanted a product that I'm interested in.

141
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,460
And the cool thing working at NBC universal is I get a chance to learn really

142
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,940
a whole new technology, not in the, in the stack or the stack site enough.

143
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,980
Yeah. But I get a chance to learn a little bit more how broadcast media

144
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,900
works, just kind of interesting. By the way,

145
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,780
I was in Los Angeles for a couple of days this week.

146
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,460
Steve took me on a golf cart trip around the back loss of NBC universal.

147
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,060
I drove through the set of the good place and wisteria lane,

148
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,180
we're just for housewives was and saw that we're the Bates hotel from psycho.

149
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Lots of cool stuff. Anyway, rewind the stack. And I wanted after working at a

150
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,980
globally distributed company and many, many time zones of work and sometimes

151
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,660
doing two of the same meeting in a day, which I didn't mind it.

152
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,180
I liked it. I like engaging with the team,

153
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,100
but it was starting to burn me out.

154
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,820
We talked about that a few times ago.

155
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,780
The other thing I wanted was I was getting beginning to get some push to go

156
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,420
back to the office at unity. They wanted to go, well,

157
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,180
let's get the leaders to go in three times a week. And I remember our,

158
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,620
well, so they use his name. I won't use his name. A,

159
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,180
a people leader at unity who I don't have a lot of respect for due to

160
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,580
previous, the previous interactions with him to unity came into the office.

161
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,580
One day, first time I'd ever seen him in the office to ask us if we'd,

162
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,580
he might've been even been on zoom to ask the leaders in the Seattle office.

163
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,220
If we start going in three times a week. And I told him,

164
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,180
I've been coming in three times a week out of me being a little sick of home

165
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,300
for a long time and hasn't made a difference. I don't think this is going to

166
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,140
happen.

167
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,820
Gave all kinds of feedback on how none of the teams were in one spot and

168
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,180
blah, blah, blah. And it was just weird.

169
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,380
And that was some part of what I wanted to do when I joined a company was join a

170
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,540
team that was largely or fully remote and our engineering team,

171
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,980
although some people go to offices, if they're near one,

172
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,220
it is basically fully remote, which is no,

173
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,340
there's no requirement to go to the office. It means I get to work.

174
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,060
The times when I have a meeting,

175
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,620
when there's that weird hybrid thing,

176
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,500
when you have all your little zoom or teams windows,

177
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,780
let's come back to that too. And you have person, person, person,

178
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,660
whole group of people is really, really rare. It's generally,

179
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,060
I've maybe seen it once. So it's one person. So anyway, that's really cool.

180
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,900
So all those things just kind of came together very quickly when NBCU contacted

181
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,260
me. I got all the three P's of people, the person, the product.

182
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,660
I got some of the, the sort of intangibles I wanted around fully remote work.

183
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,500
And it all kind of worked out much quicker than I had planned.

184
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,580
And here I am a couple of things to drill in along the road.

185
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,900
There is, oh,

186
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,300
the reason I brought up unity is not only the layoff 600 people,

187
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,620
but in the same swipe of the knife,

188
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,140
they said that everyone at the company, this is heck, this is hurt.

189
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,780
I haven't heard it from unity leadership. I've heard it from people reaching out

190
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,660
going, Hey, this sucks.

191
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,020
What do you think is that they're requiring people to go to the office three

192
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,380
days a week from now on, actually starting at some date in the near future,

193
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,540
which I think I'm curious to hear your opinion on this,

194
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,100
maybe compared to Microsoft, but I think I'm, I was going to say horrible.

195
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,580
I think it's kind of idiotic unless they're trying to get people to quit.

196
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,580
What Microsoft is still full.

197
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,180
Can you, you can still be fully remote at Microsoft. Is that correct?

198
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,820
Oh yeah. It's, I would say right now,

199
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,460
Microsoft is going in the opposite direction of that.

200
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,540
The, um,

201
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,340
please don't come in. It's cheaper for us when you work at home, right?

202
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,860
Well, they're never, they're, they're not going to mention it that way.

203
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,150
Right. I, my career, I, I,

204
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,430
I fill in the parts that people say quietly. I say the quiet parts out loud.

205
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,180
What is happening is certainly we,

206
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,180
it's it's public that Microsoft is not renewing the lease on any of its

207
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,060
lease buildings. Correct. Right. So that's public.

208
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,820
What we can also see is there is a,

209
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,820
there is a large sentence. Like I can look, as you know,

210
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,820
I come into my office every day and I have been doing so for the last several

211
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,820
years, all but one month of COVID and parking lots empty.

212
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,260
And so there's some rationale to,

213
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,460
to Microsoft being able to do that. Yeah, of course.

214
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,060
I would say Microsoft could look at,

215
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,780
they could turn into a lease or at least some of their buildings to other people

216
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,500
at some point. I'm not sure the security implications around that,

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,780
but that could be done. I think across the campus,

218
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,580
my gut is that there are buildings,

219
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,820
a whole bunch of buildings, no more than a quarter full.

220
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,460
For sure. I,

221
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,500
I would be surprised if there's any building that's a quarter full.

222
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,020
Yeah. The one thing though, team cohesion,

223
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I would say certainly I haven't discovered the secret to it.

224
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,590
I do miss team cohesion. I miss the work benefits.

225
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,660
I miss the personal benefits of having the team there and working together.

226
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,500
Do you remember once upon a time when I asked you like a question,

227
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,780
a yes or no question of does Microsoft require people to go back to work?

228
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,860
So the answer is no. It doesn't, no. And here's the deal. I think,

229
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,380
you know, I don't know what's inside of you news executives minds. Uh,

230
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,620
but there is, I get where they're coming from a little bit.

231
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,020
There's something that you get when people are together that you don't,

232
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,940
that many teams don't generally get when they're all in their homes.

233
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,300
My goal, what drives me and what I'm,

234
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,620
I think I'm making some progress on it.

235
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,020
What I'm always thinking of as a manager is how do I do that?

236
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,860
How do I build team cohesion?

237
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,700
How do I get a team to work together when they're not all hanging out one place?

238
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,680
I think what has happened over the last,

239
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,080
has it been 25 years since COVID hit? I can't quite remember.

240
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,110
I've lost track of time. So in the last, uh, three or 25 years is that we have

241
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,790
meetings and maybe even more meetings,

242
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,870
which is odd because there's two things we screwed up on.

243
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,270
One is in our meetings, all we ever talk about is work.

244
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,390
I shouldn't say we as too big of a generalization.

245
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,190
If you don't change anything,

246
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,750
you have zoom meetings or teams meetings and all we ever talk about is work.

247
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,730
We never get fun or can we just talk about stuff? Can we goof off together?

248
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,890
So one thing to do is make it,

249
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,290
we had a discussion in the Slack group this week about the same thing.

250
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,210
What do you do about remote teams? One of the three.slack.com,

251
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,330
you can go to moderntesting.org and get a link.

252
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,530
I will try and keep it up to date. It's not up to date.

253
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,410
You can yell at me, but don't always talk about meetings.

254
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,170
There's things like take the first five minutes of every meeting just for people

255
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,970
to either show up late or just have hallway talk, whatever,

256
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,170
but also is focused on async work.

257
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,290
Not every decision needs a meeting.

258
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,970
Not every design needs a meeting.

259
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,220
Collaborate as much as you can asynchronously and just embrace,

260
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,900
like embrace the fact that we're not all getting back together and focus more

261
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,900
on it. So where many organizations I feel have failed here is giving managers

262
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,580
and teams the education because they don't know it's all right.

263
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,100
And there's so little experimenting because they're driving people to get stuff

264
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,980
done to get, uh,

265
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,700
give people a chance of being successful in a fully remote world.

266
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,340
I think a lot of times people haven't done that.

267
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,700
So if the managers to figure it out,

268
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,420
the managers don't try to figure it out.

269
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,700
If they don't think it's their job to figure it out,

270
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,900
it can get really boring really fast.

271
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,420
The issue as I see it,

272
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,860
I do wish my team would come in more often in terms of,

273
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,140
of the, the requirements.

274
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,020
So why don't you require them to come to work three days a week?

275
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,260
Yeah. But then that's not going to work.

276
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,060
That's a real question. Tell me why it doesn't work.

277
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,340
I understand the rationale around unity making the decision, right?

278
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,300
The benefit they're trying to achieve. Unfortunately, uh, and I,

279
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,020
and I know you agree with this.

280
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,580
The way they approached it is going to guarantee they don't achieve the

281
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,300
benefits they were seeking.

282
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,580
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

283
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,100
Right. It's no, you have to,

284
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,500
if you want that the benefits of that you get from the team being co-located,

285
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,060
you either have to completely pull the sweat, right?

286
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,780
Very similar to what you were just saying before, right?

287
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,140
You basically do an Elon Musk type of thing and you're like, Hey,

288
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,820
from here on out, everyone is required back at work every day.

289
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,060
Right. And then yeah,

290
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,060
you're going to go through a difficult period and then people will renormalize or

291
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,820
you have to create, you have to make,

292
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,060
you have to create a motivation or an incentive such that it's their choice and

293
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,660
they would prefer. Yeah. Carrots versus sticks.

294
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,500
Exactly. If you're going to do a stick, the stick has to be,

295
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,300
has to be, has to hit hard and fast and then be over very similar to the

296
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,460
layoff situation. But if you're not, then it's got to be in the carrot.

297
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,620
Although I would prefer a cupcake carrot suck.

298
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,980
So one thing I put a pin in, I want to talk about.

299
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,140
So I have a whole bunch of stuff about work we could talk about,

300
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,060
but let's see, you know, we used to do this session like Alan at Unity.

301
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,220
What have you learned? We'll do a little bit here in a moment.

302
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,380
But one thing I got to tell you, so remember,

303
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,220
it's such a different situation from when I left Microsoft to Microsoft.

304
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,260
I was on this really toxic team, so I was really bitter about it.

305
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,140
And I give you a bad time about it a lot, but you told me Satya is making it

306
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,140
better. And I actually do believe you decide to be giving you a bad time.

307
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,340
I wasn't going to use and I still haven't used the Bing chat thing you suggest

308
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
to me, but I didn't use it because I don't run windows because who does.

309
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,860
And but I found out they make edge for Mac because the Bing chat thing only

310
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,300
works on edge. So I'm going to try that out sometime.

311
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,140
I heard from one of my new directs that edge on Mac isn't so bad,

312
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,660
so I'll give it a shot. So the difference is that Unity is like,

313
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,540
my team was fricking awesome. I really, you know, it's a bunch of people.

314
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,420
I still really miss and I'm it's unfortunate in that situation.

315
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,540
Any of my anger at Unity is towards our executive leadership.

316
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,900
Just good people. It's just in some unfortunate circumstances.

317
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,860
But as I've mentioned on this podcast before,

318
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,660
other than visual studio code and my Xbox,

319
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,420
I did not use a Microsoft application from the day I left Microsoft it during

320
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,820
my entire run at Unity. And I'm very happy about that.

321
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,970
I didn't really miss it. So here I am working at NBCU and damn it,

322
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,130
if they don't use Microsoft apps,

323
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,850
I spend a chunk of my day on teams calls now and it's not so bad.

324
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,770
What the, what are you doing?

325
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,010
Brent is looking at me as tongues like, okay, so, uh,

326
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,890
okay teams, it's all right. It's all right. It's a little flakier.

327
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,210
Like sometimes when my camera dies, it's a little flakier,

328
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,610
but they're doing okay there. I'm not, it's, it's better.

329
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,770
I think they've replaced all the leadership on teams since I left probably at least

330
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,090
once. So it's doing all right. Uh,

331
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,770
the other thing is office apps.

332
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,290
They just feel cluttered to me.

333
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,980
Like you've been, you've been used to the Google version.

334
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,980
Yeah. And so they do and they don't.

335
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,980
So the apps feel cluttered. I spent, oh my God,

336
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,140
how much time trying to use PowerPoint the other day and it hurt.

337
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm going to go back to keynote. Uh, I can't do it again.

338
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,940
Just trying to find where commands were and looking up things on the web.

339
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,540
It's just, I think to me, PowerPoint is just awful.

340
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,940
Word I kind of like Excel's, you know, good. Um,

341
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,140
I don't use most of the features of it and, and, but it's, it's,

342
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,460
I can handle it. Outlook on Mac is lacking.

343
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,740
That's a good way of putting it. So what I found is for, uh,

344
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,060
mail and calendar, I don't know if you do,

345
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,500
I don't know if the, what the outlet client for windows is like,

346
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,820
but for Mac it's not good. So I use,

347
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,620
and I'm pretty happy with just using the web web version of Outlook and calendar

348
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,860
and I'm, and I'm pretty happy with those. It's, you know,

349
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,780
it's not my favorite, but I'm making it work.

350
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,220
But here I am after six years of making fun of all your Microsoft crap.

351
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,180
And now I got to use it every day. Cause we all have to pay our penance.

352
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,380
I don't know what to do. It's,

353
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,280
it's,

354
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,360
you'll renormalize in no time.

355
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,560
I remember when I finally, when I finally gave up on the windows phone,

356
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,960
right? I'm like, no,

357
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm going to support our company and I finally gave up on windows phone.

358
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,480
And it took me maybe 15 minutes with the app store on my,

359
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,120
on my Samsung, Android, obviously. Uh, and I'm like,

360
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
yeah, that was a poor decision.

361
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Yeah, that was a poor decision.

362
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,800
Windows Phone is a great story about Microsoft.

363
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,320
Windows Phone was actually a really good phone.

364
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,170
The way it was set up, it was a good phone UI. It was a good phone.

365
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,130
Microsoft's ego

366
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,730
got in their way.

367
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,060
It wasn't Microsoft's ego, it was Bombers' ego.

368
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,440
Well, the bomber years were pretty devastating to

369
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Microsoft.

370
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,960
As a phone, the Microsoft phone was actually really good.

371
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,600
The frustrating part of the Windows Phone was there were hardly any apps available for it.

372
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
That's what makes phones is the apps.

373
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,040
And not only that, I don't know if you recall this, but a lot of times

374
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,880
when I shipped over to Android and started reinstalling my apps on Android,

375
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,880
same apps a lot of them, plus some new ones because it had, you know,

376
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,560
100 times as many.

377
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,320
Some of the apps that I'd use forever on Windows Phone and use on Android,

378
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,000
they actually had more features on Android.

379
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,120
It's like, oh my god, what have I been missing out on?

380
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Right.

381
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,880
And I've been using Apple Phone now more. I have Apple Phone for work and an iPhone, also called an iPhone, yes.

382
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,720
And same is true there. The iPhone has

383
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,760
maybe not as many apps in the long tail,

384
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,240
but there's a lot of apps that are iPhone only and some of the apps have more features in their Android counterparts.

385
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,200
I remember, I remember playing with Linux in the late 90s, mid to late 90s at

386
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:06,800
Microsoft and me saying out loud and getting laughed at was Microsoft should make a Windows 95 shell from Linux.

387
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,000
And they should have.

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,680
And I said the same thing with Windows Phone in the early 2000s.

389
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,640
We should write this shell to run on Android.

390
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,170
And no, that ever happened because nobody listens to me and whatever.

391
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:29,770
But I honestly think, imagine this, what if Windows Phone, that shell ran on Android OS?

392
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,850
I think it'd be a very good phone. I think that I liked that tile approach, but who knows? I don't know.

393
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,770
Yeah, no, the, I don't. So you said you have an iPhone.

394
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:46,330
So on Android, there's this component called the launcher. Are you familiar with that?

395
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:46,970
Yep.

396
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,450
Okay. It's kind of the thing that defines the sort of look and feel of the whole thing.

397
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,850
Well, there is this thing called the Microsoft launcher for Android.

398
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:05,850
And that is one of the top rated launchers for all of Android.

399
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:12,890
I don't currently use. That's the that's the launcher I use just because of.

400
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,010
I really like how it organizes.

401
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,850
No, that's interesting.

402
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,530
My apps amongst everything else. There is a launcher we you could you could.

403
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,730
And then maybe even this one, I just may have forgotten it.

404
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,730
But there is a launcher where you can scan Android to look like the old Windows look.

405
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,730
I believe it. Okay. Yeah.

406
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,330
Oh, well, I mean, but now it's for free. Microsoft could have made some,

407
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,090
could have done a little bit better. I don't think they made money.

408
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,850
They could have gained some customers. There was a time I also said that

409
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:50,170
Microsoft should stop. Here's the other suggestion I gave a little more out there.

410
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,690
Take all the oh my God, I have so many stories about Windows phone developers.

411
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,650
But the one thing I said, stop developing Windows phone.

412
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,970
Take all of those whatever it was like 400 developers working on it.

413
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,090
Have them all right. Apps for Android and iOS will make more money that way.

414
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,170
They make them Windows phone.

415
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,010
For sure. I still think I would have been right. But no.

416
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,250
And I remember when I worked on Arcadia, the stupid science project to make Android

417
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,650
apps run on Windows phone, which is actually super easy.

418
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,890
I remember biting my tongue and sometimes laughing out loud when I be in a meeting with these

419
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,610
these developers that worked on Windows phone. Remember Windows phone,

420
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,770
as far as I'm concerned, was a complete nutter flop.

421
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,620
It was. I think we I think if I recall,

422
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,300
Not as much as Ken, which he has stories on. But I remember being in these meetings.

423
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,780
And those developers because a bunch of those folks went over to this Arcadia team

424
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,700
and those developers were so this is the thing that Microsoft had.

425
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,180
I'll say had at the time, maybe different now.

426
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,260
Bomber years. I think out of the bomber years, it was expected that to get ahead,

427
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,100
you must have a very large ego and show it off daily.

428
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,860
I remember so many times those folks would say we try to make a decision.

429
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,540
They say, well, on Windows phone, what we did, and I'm thinking now I wanted to say

430
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,580
out loud, whatever you do on Windows phone, whatever you did, let's do the exact opposite.

431
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,500
Let's everything you did. Let's do the other thing and see if it sucks less.

432
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,060
You're like, thank you for your feedback.

433
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:25,100
I just facepalmed, rubbed my eyebrow off and waited for the drugs to kick in.

434
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,540
But you remember that ego. So here's yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,020
And you can let me know what I was like in Microsoft now.

436
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,140
And oh my gosh, I get to work with Microsoft people now because of Azure and GitHub,

437
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,940
which is kind of Microsoft and other Microsoft things we use.

438
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,020
It's not kind of Microsoft.

439
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,790
I know. Well, it depends how the acquisition goes. Sometimes Microsoft, it depends. Sometimes

440
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:57,550
you leave stuff alone for longer. I mean, LinkedIn is Microsoft, kind of. It's still pretty separate.

441
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:05,710
Well, that's it's the Windows organization is still pretty separate from the Office.

442
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,350
Fine, fine, fine, fine. But the point I wanted to bring up is other than those

443
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,150
execs who happen to come from Microsoft via Amazon, Unity was great. There weren't

444
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,990
egos getting in the way of good work. It was easy to do good work. I've noticed the same

445
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:24,430
thing at NBCU. There aren't. Oh my God, I have to tell you this as I hate that Steve

446
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,310
listens to this podcast, but I'll get over it because one great thing he did,

447
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,190
and I may have mentioned this before, he set me up with like 30 people to go talk to.

448
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,950
You know how you always give the new hires people to go meet. He gave me a massive list

449
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,790
and 90% of the people, no matter what their level were, said, if you have any questions,

450
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:48,590
anything at all, reach out. Anytime will help you out. Imagine that. Imagine me meeting a

451
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,390
bunch of Microsoft execs back in the day, maybe 10 years ago in that time.

452
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:00,030
And how many of them would say that? None. So that's the difference that I really,

453
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:05,230
really like. I like working. I mean, this isn't a hard, this is a little bit of tautology,

454
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:12,030
maybe I like working with people I like. Yeah, I think you mean more than that though.

455
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:20,030
I don't, I don't miss that old model. I really don't. Right. I kind of like, I do like the fact

456
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:25,230
that the more of the in-point microservice service model, the world that we're in right now

457
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:36,760
has almost killed the bet the farm mentality, which bred these egotistical bastards who,

458
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:45,480
who would win arguments back in the old days. When, when no one had the data to dispute it,

459
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:55,720
they would stand up, go, I have been here for 15 years and they leverage BS background stories.

460
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,880
Yeah. Yeah. I don't programming at cobalt. You were still waiting the bed. I'm right. You're wrong.

461
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,240
Go back to school. Yeah. And the thing is with, with the way the world functions now,

462
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,360
yeah, those people aren't really surviving as well as they used to.

463
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,720
That wasn't the case. Remember when I left, it was a weird place where Microsoft was growing up.

464
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,320
We had all these people that had been there 20 years or so, just, but who weren't,

465
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,000
who were still trying to do things the way they were 20 years ago. And the one of my,

466
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,360
that was one of my frustrations. Yeah. And, and rightly so. And I won't,

467
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:40,360
I won't look you in the eyes until you they're all gone. Right. The ones I've been paying attention

468
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,000
to, I'll tell you, there's only two of them left. It used to be like 20. And, and right now the ones

469
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm paying attention to, there's only two left. I will not mention names. What are their initials?

470
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:01,500
F you Frank. All right. Okay. So you won't tell me, um, culture's getting better. Culture is good here.

471
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,660
I like working with people. I like, uh, have we talked about anything at all substantial yet?

472
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:19,160
Uh, we briefly talked about chat GPT. I repeat my question. Yeah. We, we, we talked about forced

473
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:26,380
office attendance. All right. Okay. That's a bad thing. Um, and I do think,

474
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,130
right. So, so the thing is like you, you, uh, the in-person and personal connections

475
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:42,010
are difficult to quantify, but invaluable. Let me just maybe set up and discuss a little bit.

476
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm going to talk about where I'm at and what I'm doing. I think it may set up some different

477
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,040
discussions. So those of you that have been listening to the podcast for a very, very,

478
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,520
very long time, know that when I first joined unity, we would spend some chunk of time in

479
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,480
the podcast. I would talk about, again, this podcast is just two guys talking over beer,

480
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,040
although I'm drinking water and Brent's picking his nose and just talking about what's going

481
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,640
on in front of people. That's, that's the whole premise of the podcast in the first place. We

482
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,080
don't, we have vague agendas, but six years ago at unity, we talked about what was going on

483
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,520
in the team, what I was thinking, what I was learning, what the metaphors I was seeing,

484
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,480
the cool stuff I was discovering. And I think we can do a little bit of that here while I figure

485
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,400
stuff out. So one cool thing that happened, I did not have direct reports up until this week.

486
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,120
So I spent my first month or so without direct reports. Well, I met a bunch of people and

487
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,580
figured everything out and learned the projects. And, but at this point I have a team. I know

488
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,660
what work needs to get done. I'm not going to go into details. Aren't important. When you

489
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,660
work on stuff, I, you could, it's, if you work on an infrastructure or a platform group,

490
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:55,340
it's the stuff you imagine it's things around cloud optimization and migrations from tool

491
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:01,100
X to tool Y. That's what we do. Very, very, very high level. So I'm at the stage now where

492
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:07,820
it's, which I really, really like it's working with a team to teach them, not teach them,

493
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,020
working with a team to help them learn how to deliver more consistently. And you and I

494
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,660
have talked about this a lot. This lines up well with the modern testing principles, which,

495
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:26,300
as an aside that I don't want to get into, but it's a long story, but our buddy James Bach

496
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,780
added a bunch of comments to different articles on a website that's about to launch officially

497
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,340
at soft launched about to launch next week. There'll be a blurb on various social media

498
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,380
from me, but it replied about modern testing principles. And guess what he said, not, not my

499
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,220
post, somebody else went, another one of the three posted them and he said, Hey, these aren't

500
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,620
modern and these aren't about testing at all. We should call these modern delivery principles.

501
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:57,260
Yes. Yes, we should, but, uh, I read me toad. All right. Well, call, I, I, I kind of agree

502
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,900
because it prompts the discussion. So welcome to the discussion, James. I think in one of

503
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,860
those replies, he actually makes the point that I saw him made somewhere else, saw him make

504
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:15,180
somewhere else, which I couldn't find last week, which is that he cares about testing and not

505
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,580
quality. And that's fine. You can do that. So anyway, we're going to learn modern testing

506
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:25,260
principles, modern delivery principles, which is let's figure out, I mean, it's really agile and

507
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,500
lean. How can we deliver? How can we be transparent about the way we deliver? How can

508
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,340
we be accountable? How can we begin to build up safety in our organization? How can then going

509
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:44,540
back a topic or two, how can we work effectively together, even though none of us are together?

510
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,500
And it'll take time. I think that safety part, especially it's going to take months.

511
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,620
You never get to a point where you go, yes, I've flipped the switch. This team is now

512
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,740
psychologically safe. It is a spectrum that all you can do is try and move forward on all the time.

513
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,300
So we'll work on that, the normal stuff, trying to get the team in place to execute.

514
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,100
Just made just had someone accept an offer for a director reporting to me working in the tool

515
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,690
space. I'm excited about that. We'll get them ramped up when they start. So just in the

516
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:25,850
forming stage, I guess. So it's fun and a lot of work to do a lot of just a lot of people to learn.

517
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,650
And you know, which is hard because as all three listeners know, I don't really like people,

518
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:38,330
but I like it when people are successful. So I sacrifice my dislike of people to help people

519
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,250
be successful. And that's kind of where we're at now, but we should probably some things we should

520
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,930
dive into at some point. But Brett, you haven't changed jobs in a long time. What do you think

521
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,970
about all that? What do you think about like diving into the, Oh God, I have to do five projects

522
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:57,610
I'd never thought about before with, with a huge number of people I've never thought about before.

523
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:02,410
How do you feel about that? So I am doing the former all of the time. That's,

524
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:10,330
I thought about it. You're right. The, I am now in the job that I have been in for the longest

525
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:18,560
continuous period in my entire career. So new, new people, new people, new team that actually might be

526
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:27,200
nice. So I've been on the team now for the longest I have in my entire career, eight years,

527
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,600
right? Previous to that, I was in exchange for five. And then up until then, really a max of three,

528
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:41,500
right? I kind of, I found it more, I kind of viewed myself more like Mary Poppins. All right. I kind of

529
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:48,060
solve this team or what I can hear is time to go to someplace else. But in this, in the team I'm on

530
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:58,860
right now, we are changing direction as all the time as a data scientist, right? My job is to,

531
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:09,420
to answer the questions the business has now. So I'm constantly having to adapt. And unfortunately,

532
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,940
sometimes it ends up being an interrupt, which I'm trying to remove because that has a negative

533
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:22,410
consequence on the, on my team itself. But we're constantly doing new, new, new projects. And,

534
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:31,850
and as I mentioned at the start of the podcast, right, GPT is representing a non trivial threat to

535
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:39,130
a set of services that my team has done for a long time. And so it's always exciting. Like I,

536
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:46,250
I called it a threat, but that's, that's not the perspective I'm taking. Anytime change happens,

537
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,210
there's always opportunity, you need to look for it, which is what I'm doing. And I'm starting to

538
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:57,930
converge on it and starting to get other attention, which will, which will result in new interesting

539
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:03,530
work. So I'm curious cause I, I, I don't know if you gave a good answer. It wasn't really the

540
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:10,010
question I asked. Okay. I mean, you kind of justify you do what you do have some overlap.

541
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:16,490
I think it's worth calling out and my, my, my boss sometimes asks me if I'm ready to run away

542
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:24,570
screaming and I sometimes feel, but not really feel like it. A role like this is, as I've talked

543
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:30,330
to some other folks about it, is kind of not for the faint of heart, brand new team, lots of stuff

544
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:39,440
to a lot of things to do, a lot of legacy to move past, a lot of things to learn. It's a kind of a

545
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,400
role I love. I love to start from scratch, but I don't think that everyone does. No. So

546
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,560
I have never been afraid. It's quite the opposite. A lot of people were like,

547
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:02,590
when I, when I become the head of a new team, I love it internally. I love it. When one of my

548
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:08,060
leaders comes to me and says, Brandon, I hear what you're saying, but that won't work here.

549
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:17,660
I love it. I'm like, Oh yeah. You, you, you remember that you said that I'm a change agent and that,

550
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:24,060
that type of world is where change agents are like, okay, there's a team that's stuck because they

551
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:31,020
believe they can't change. Have you ever done like a puzzle hunt or one of those kinds of things or

552
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,620
even a puzzle room where you, you know, there's a way out and actually you're, and you're pretty

553
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:42,460
confident because you've done one before maybe that you can get out. You don't know where to start

554
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:48,220
and like my blog posts from a few weeks ago on angry weasel.substack.com. You just start,

555
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:55,530
you find something, you look at it and you figure out if it's a clue or not. And maybe you come

556
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:00,090
back to it later, but that's kind of the organizational challenge. You look at things,

557
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:06,650
you trust, but verify you question, you figure out if the smoke alarm was actually a fire.

558
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,370
And you just kind of poke around till you make progress. And again, in a puzzle room,

559
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,650
you may be stuck. You may think you're stuck, but you look back into the progress. You know,

560
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:21,050
we must be getting somewhere because I can see tangible progress I've made on figuring stuff out.

561
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:25,610
I just need to make a few more connections and I'll get into the next room and start over again.

562
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,610
I just made up this metaphor on the spot, but I think it kind of works. And I like that.

563
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:37,530
I like not knowing where to start, but knowing, but feeling at least semi-confident that I can get

564
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:44,170
to the end state and then make a new, and then make a new end state, but get to the end state.

565
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,730
If I just begin and move forward.

566
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:54,090
The thing that I think is awesome about fresh eyes and right in this case,

567
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:59,130
your fresh eyes and your leadership, right? The thing I think is old eyes.

568
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:08,890
The thing that's awesome about fresh eyes is you have not yet learned what can't be done.

569
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,490
Correct. It's all in front of me.

570
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:19,530
And then the combined that with a team that has learned what can't be done.

571
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,840
But if you remember way back in the 12 monkey story, not the movie, but the one with the

572
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:32,760
ladder where there's a cultural thing set up and people are doing things that they don't even

573
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,720
remember why they're doing it that way anymore. They just know it can't be done. They don't know why.

574
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,120
That's where someone with fresh eyes can go. Well, why are we doing this?

575
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,610
We don't know. Well, then let's just stop. That is one of the reasons why I'm just,

576
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:58,110
I think I told you on this on the podcast before. There was a team I was on years ago.

577
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,990
It reminds me of this. There was a team that was on. I joined the team.

578
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:10,000
This was in the old school and they had shipped three products and had their build verification

579
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,540
test pass in six years. And I'm like, what a bizarre problem. I was excited.

580
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:25,580
I went to my manager. I'm like, I would absolutely love this problem because build verification tests

581
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:35,150
are so simple. I'm kind of puzzled as to what this team did to even make that possible.

582
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:44,190
Yeah, I'd be intentionally curious also. It's really hard to do this. I'm convinced of that.

583
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:49,630
It is much easier to get BBTs to pass than to go six years and have them not pass.

584
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:56,140
I would think so. So yeah. All right. Let's call that a day, man. Cause I gotta go.

585
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:03,900
I do too. All right. Well, once again, I am brand jason. No, I'm not. I'm, I'm Alan.

586
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,590
I'm Brent. Now we got it straight. Yeah, whatever. It's me. I'm the

587
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:13,470
old age. All right. See you man. Sorry. Next week. Bye. Everybody. Thanks for listening. Bye.
