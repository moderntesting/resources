1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
to deliver with fast feedback loops and count on fast feedback loops and rely and use those

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,720
as part of the way you deliver.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,320
That's a big, that's a, that's a jump.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,540
That's a, that's a lock step jump in your maturity and your capability and your quality.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,060
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,220
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership,

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,860
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,620
Now on with the show.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,500
Oh, Hey, Oh, Hey, uh, yeah, I'm Alan.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,780
I'm Brent and that was the AB testing podcast.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,820
Thanks everybody.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,420
All right.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,180
No, no, I got it backwards.

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,860
I got it backward.

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,180
I'm confused.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,940
This is welcome.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,700
Welcome to the AB testing podcast.

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,300
Oh, I thought we were just doing one really short this time.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,580
Actually, I liked the shorter podcast, but that may be a little bit too short, a little

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,620
bit too short.

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,820
It is, I'm going to touch on something.

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,340
I have so many things to talk about and share with our audience.

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,980
I promise as usual by 10 minutes in, we're going to get to the regular topics,

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,580
but, uh, so I will time box that, but how have you been, Brent?

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,300
What's going on with you?

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,700
Anything new and exciting in your world?

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,940
We're just a few weeks away from reward release.

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,740
Wait, is Microsoft doing rewards this year?

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,940
I thought there was something like they weren't.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
Well, uh, they claim they are.

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,060
I mean, no one's getting a raise.

32
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,500
Oh, but you get like the normal Microsoft bonuses and et cetera.

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,140
Well, that's the question.

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,860
Or maybe.

35
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,780
So maybe, yeah.

36
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,380
Um, should hunger games.

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,260
Just put a pile of money and let people fight it out.

38
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,580
Being old and that is shape.

39
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,620
I'm, I'm certain I don't like that idea.

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,140
No, you could do it like do it a Microsoft way, do it like a elite code

41
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,340
competition to see who, no, don't even do that.

42
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,100
That would be done.

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,700
All right.

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,940
Well, that's always exciting.

45
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,820
That is always the fun part, you know, peak in May, as they say, as I've said.

46
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:54,980
Right.

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,420
We are in the middle of July.

48
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,460
It has been Seattle warm here in the eighties.

49
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,030
Yeah.

50
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,030
Do you have AC?

51
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,070
I do.

52
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,830
I, well, I do.

53
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,470
And I don't, and I'll get to that in a minute.

54
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,910
No, don't, don't, don't, don't.

55
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,790
Hey, it is.

56
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,350
But before I get to that, are you ready for this weekend?

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,920
Yes.

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,480
No, maybe.

59
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,800
Why do you ask?

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,400
So I have seen the meme around how F up this weekend's going to be.

61
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,040
Yeah.

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,120
If you live or intend to go to Seattle.

63
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,280
I, along with five teenagers will be at the Taylor Swift concert tomorrow.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
Oh, okay.

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,040
So are you, are you leaving right after this podcast?

66
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,560
No, I, no, I actually was cheapest way to do it was to book a flight from

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,120
Seattle, which is the airport south of Seattle up to Vancouver, Canada, and

68
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,640
jump out of the plane partway through and parachute to the stadium.

69
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,600
Cause there's no other way to get downtown because there's a Mariners

70
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,480
game at the same time.

71
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,560
Oh no, you do not understand.

72
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
I'm going to load up.

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,280
I'm saying we don't, while Brent is bringing up his, his webpage of

74
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,360
information for me.

75
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,760
Yeah.

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,520
It's going to be a wild weekend in Seattle.

77
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
It's going to be hot.

78
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,720
It's going to be, I don't know how well I do know how we're going to

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,360
get to the stadium, but I feel like, Oh, it'll be after the show by

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,320
the time people hear this.

81
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,280
So, uh, going to get on the light rail somewhere, not sure where, but

82
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,000
somewhere, cause they're running extra trains.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,260
That's going to be the way in, uh, and likely from the south.

84
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,820
Because I think I normally do light rail from, from Northgate mall.

85
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,500
Yeah.

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,020
That's an option.

87
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,370
I just feel like 30,000 people going to the concert who live anywhere

88
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,250
on the North end of Seattle and, and nor a North from there will be

89
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,410
taking light rail from the North gate mall.

90
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,090
And this is, uh, Brent's ceiling of his office.

91
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,490
Okay.

92
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,610
He's showing there's a thing.

93
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,570
There's a little map cartoon drawing thing that shows that there are 87,000

94
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,050
different events going on.

95
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,570
One of the bridges is closed.

96
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,730
It's going to be wild.

97
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,410
I'm going to be part of that wildness.

98
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,930
I will let you know how it goes.

99
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,570
I'll let you know in two weeks when we record again, I will let you know.

100
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,560
What happened as I brought five teenagers to a Taylor Swift concert and survived.

101
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,200
Or, or, or this is the last podcast ever.

102
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
You're doing this Saturday, Saturday.

103
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,640
Yeah.

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,680
Okay.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,150
So Taylor Swift Saturday, uh, Mariner's game, Saturday bite of Seattle all

106
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,590
weekend, the Seattle storm Saturday.

107
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,630
Uh, the bridges out to see what else.

108
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,110
Yeah.

109
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,630
For the first time since 2019, Seattle will look like it's an

110
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,230
actual city where people are.

111
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,070
And apparently Capitol Hill's having a block party on Saturday.

112
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,550
Yeah.

113
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,030
Yep.

114
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,310
So, uh, speaking of Capitol Hill, uh, I have mentioned many times before

115
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,990
segue, uh, on this podcast that once, uh, and, and probably to you more times

116
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,310
that the plan has always been to get the hell out of suburbia as soon as

117
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,430
the youngest child goes off to college.

118
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,020
Yes.

119
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,120
Getting out of, uh, getting out of the burbs, uh, bought a house on Capitol Hill.

120
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
Oh, okay.

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,000
You did the new, so we're going from a 20, a house built in

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,840
2018 to a house built in 1904.

123
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,760
I was going to say 1820.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,920
So no, no AC currently in the new house, but by the time we move in, which

125
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,440
will be September, we're kind of past the major heat, so I'll deal with that.

126
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,400
Later.

127
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
But, uh, excited going to be, going to be fun.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,240
It just kind of happened.

129
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,080
We're doing kind of the casual looking and maybe this house, no, maybe this house.

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,360
No.

131
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Well, this one, if we can, well, we'll put it off right now.

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,440
What the heck?

133
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
And it worked out.

134
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,240
So we're good to go and, uh, closing like August, middle of

135
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,440
August, end of August sometime.

136
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,000
We're going to plan.

137
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,680
I got a, I got to move in before September 13th or so, because I'm going

138
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,200
on that walk around Mount Rainier in September.

139
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,160
I want to get it done before then.

140
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,120
Yeah.

141
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,320
So that's exciting and new.

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,760
That is exciting and new.

143
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,200
I mean, it's, it's not a goal I share.

144
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,760
No, a lot of people don't want to be in Seattle.

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,440
You know, I spent so much of my life there.

146
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,680
I want to go back and I, and here's the deal.

147
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
We originally thought we'd move back downtown and this was the plan back in

148
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,640
the 20 teens when people actually lived in downtown and it just, this is don't,

149
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,480
it's a ghost town except for this weekend.

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,680
So maybe someday, maybe someday still.

151
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,680
So, uh, for those that don't know the geography Capitol Hill is, you know,

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,560
it's a 20 minute walk from downtown, but it's just up one of the hills and it's

153
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
doing okay, recovering from the pandemic.

154
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,360
Few places have closed down, but there are still a good number of

155
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,440
excellent restaurants and bars and cool places to what gyms and grocery

156
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,120
stores that are, that are walkable parks, et cetera.

157
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,040
So should be pretty good.

158
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,280
No, that's it.

159
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,440
And we're, we're only about eight and a half minutes in.

160
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,680
So should we go ahead and, uh, talk about subjects people care about or

161
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
anything else you want to cover?

162
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,960
Uh, yeah, we can do that.

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
I mean, that that'll be fun and new.

164
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,040
Oh, uh, to do like a podcast about stuff about A's and B's and testings.

165
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,200
Exactly.

166
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,720
All right.

167
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,240
Well, I, an article title caught my eye this week.

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,920
It was called is software testing a dying profession.

169
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:45,050
And we have different answers and we've talked about our answer a lot.

170
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,070
Right.

171
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,390
Right.

172
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,510
The article didn't really go into that.

173
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,300
It said it's going away because of codeless automation and

174
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,820
DevOps and agile development.

175
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,100
How old is agile now?

176
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,190
Uh, it's, it's, it's old.

177
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,830
They can buy a, they can buy a beer, right?

178
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,750
We could be, yeah, absolutely.

179
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,870
We could be its father.

180
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,150
Again, to argue against this article.

181
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,190
Agile development, agile development around for a long time.

182
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,390
And this is what you and I saw.

183
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,990
So it's interesting that you and I saw 15 years ago, Hey, this is going to

184
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,590
make the need for a dedicated testing specialist and less so we began

185
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,310
AB testing and modern testing.

186
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,510
And we wanted to talk about this transition for a lot of people, but we

187
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,430
haven't seen that change happen in the last 15 years and it could be happening,

188
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,630
but it's not happening at a pace.

189
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,730
Well, at any pace it's happening, but not at a pace is impacting

190
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:43,530
testers because so many companies are again, maybe based on context,

191
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,650
maybe based on legacy.

192
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,410
They're happy to test the old way.

193
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,210
I don't want to work that way anymore, but I think testing will continue to exist.

194
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,090
AI and machine learning and testing.

195
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,810
And again, my line is AI isn't taking away anyone's job.

196
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,130
People that know how to use AI are.

197
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,250
Yes.

198
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,650
Again, when we started this podcast, I could do it now.

199
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,490
Uh, monster.com.

200
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,810
When we started this podcast, one of the things I noted was, uh, there were still

201
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,490
club all jobs.

202
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,870
Um, I bet there still are.

203
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,810
And just a quick search shows that there still are.

204
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,090
I was right.

205
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:29,890
Yeah.

206
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,290
Mainframe developer.

207
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,450
It was just opened one day ago.

208
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,370
I may or may not know someone on the podcast who's working in a company that

209
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,330
has AS 400s just, um, as an aside.

210
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,130
Well, you and I have worked on AS 400s and, or at least I have the question

211
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,410
is, I think of it kind of like, you remember limits in math class?

212
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,690
Yes, I do.

213
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,210
Holy cow.

214
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,570
Right.

215
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,890
It limits.

216
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,810
Like I, I forgotten most of math, but I remember those.

217
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,770
Limits.

218
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,010
Right.

219
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:10,620
It's this concept that it never actually reaches this number, but, um, we might as

220
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,780
well call it it's that value.

221
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,500
Yes.

222
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:13,940
Yes.

223
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Testing will never actually be dead, but do I think it will be at a point where we

224
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,580
might as well just call it that?

225
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,040
Probably.

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,560
I think that it's interesting.

227
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,880
And I think, well, on one hand, that would be my belief based on what we've

228
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,240
seen, I think it's slow.

229
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,200
I think it will ebb and flow and the people that, so I want to talk about

230
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,080
the article first and the reaction to it.

231
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,080
And then the article is a little bit straw manage and that's fine.

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm glad to see it brought up.

233
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I also feel like it's a little click baby because it's almost written to get

234
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,520
the reactions from people who make their living, not just being testers, but

235
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,440
being trainers and workshoppers and people who make their money off of

236
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,600
people who do software testing full time every day and only software testing.

237
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,120
So it hits them right in the pocket book.

238
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,960
So they made, and what I saw, and I'm not going to recap names or comments,

239
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,720
but what I was interesting, I thought it was a straw man article.

240
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,280
And the comments to the article I saw were largely straw man reactions.

241
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,680
And that could never be true because of this thing.

242
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,800
That's only true for me.

243
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:25,880
Right.

244
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,560
Not, uh, or, or, well, what about medical devices and finance?

245
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,120
I got it.

246
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
What about NASA?

247
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,520
What about airplanes and all this stuff?

248
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,440
Like if someone's going to die, you know, blah, blah, blah.

249
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,480
So let me bring up, this is hot off, not the agenda.

250
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
There's another Slack I'm in.

251
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,560
I don't know if anybody on that Slack listens to this podcast, but

252
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,640
there's a testing channel there that I usually ignore.

253
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,560
And then someone brought up.

254
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:02,150
So it started with a comment on how Cyprus may not be in, I'm not sure if it's true

255
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:07,670
or not, but may not be in business long-term because, uh, they're just,

256
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,150
they're model and Cyprus is one of the UI automation tools.

257
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,750
It's, I like it certainly better than Selenium, but they may not be actually

258
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,430
creating enough revenue to keep it going.

259
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,110
I'm not quite sure what, how much truth is there, whether it was

260
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,710
opinion or whatever, but the, uh, the Twitter post was around like

261
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,190
Cyprus is closing down and that kick off a discussion that I ignored until

262
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:34,030
it got into a conversation around the absolute necessity of UI automation.

263
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,950
And again, we've talked about this forever, but I made my point.

264
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,150
I've been saying, I looked this up for 15 years, 15 years.

265
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,830
I've been saying the following thing and people agree with me when I say it,

266
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,870
but it does not change.

267
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,550
Our industry has an unhealthy infatuation with UI automation.

268
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:02,870
Oh, well, I, I, I, I'm preaching to the AB testing choir right now.

269
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,310
Right.

270
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,670
I was just like, no.

271
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,950
So, so let me add some drama and push back.

272
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,750
Like, what did you say?

273
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,830
Unhealthy, unhealthy infatuation with the UI automation.

274
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,150
Yeah.

275
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,350
I think that's bullshit.

276
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,150
I think it's like a way, tragic, tragic sickness.

277
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,790
Okay.

278
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,350
Fine.

279
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,150
Right.

280
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,630
Something on those lines.

281
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,470
And maybe 15 years ago is an unhealthy infatuation today.

282
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,630
Maybe it is a tragic sickness.

283
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,590
Yeah.

284
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,310
Of UI automation and unhealthy.

285
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,710
I think the difference is like the person who's been told he's dying from cancer

286
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,710
in six months versus the person who eats a little bit more sweets than they're

287
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,030
supposed to, right?

288
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,510
No.

289
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,670
So it's funny.

290
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,630
And I brought this up before and I want to move on to the, uh, to some

291
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,630
more stuff about the article, but I remember I posted that on LinkedIn once

292
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,350
in response again, I don't 99% of the, of the posts I see on LinkedIn

293
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,710
that I want to jump in on because I think they're just blatantly wrong.

294
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,310
I don't bother because I just don't want to deal with it.

295
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,630
There's no reason for me to fight that fight anymore.

296
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,590
I am so moved on, but sometimes I go, you know what?

297
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,630
I want to share my thoughts here.

298
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:20,430
Once I shared this exact same comment and then, uh, or yeah, I think

299
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,550
it's probably the exact same thing.

300
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,870
And again, I got some folks on the other side, the folks that believe in that

301
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,190
there will always be a massive number.

302
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,910
Cause it needs to be for their livelihood.

303
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,750
Uh, uh, armies of dedicated testing specialists agree with that because

304
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,670
again, they're also anti, yeah, it's a big generalization.

305
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,670
This particular person, anti-automation in general.

306
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,030
But again, we agreed on that point.

307
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:50,470
And an argument I got was one is, you know, it's two, it depends on business.

308
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,670
It's the whole depends on business context thing.

309
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,030
And well, maybe you have to test the UI because of blah, blah, blah.

310
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,070
And you know, my argument against it is, well, if you, if you really, if you

311
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,870
have to test through the UI, you have other stuff to fix, but they say,

312
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,910
we can't fix that.

313
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,510
So people, they dig a hole, dig an excuse.

314
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,390
No, no, but to be clear, you do have to test through the UI.

315
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,670
You don't automate test through UI.

316
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,150
That's frigging stupid for sure.

317
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,350
But there was another thing I wanted to throw at you.

318
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,910
Well, actually, actually with one exception, which you have recently talked

319
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,510
about and they talk about in this article, right?

320
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:33,990
Which is the codeless automation, which, which, which is a bizarre concept, right?

321
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,990
And it's really just a fancy term.

322
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,590
I believe it's a fancy term for record and playback.

323
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,430
Yes.

324
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,390
Which I think today's record and playback is so much different than the

325
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,310
horrid record and playback from the future.

326
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,070
In fact, I'm going to read the whole comment I wrote.

327
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,740
I wrote two lines.

328
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,260
I will take this moment to restate something I've been saying for the last 15

329
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,860
years, our industry has an unhealthy infatuation with the UI animation.

330
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,980
Second sentence.

331
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,980
In my opinion, the record and playback of today is more than sufficient for

332
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,980
any web UI testing and that any need for extensive UI tests written in

333
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,940
Selenium Cypress Cafe could probably benefit more from a rearchitecture

334
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,300
than a bunch of fragile tests.

335
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,940
Amen, brother.

336
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,700
Not surprising, but I want, I want to throw a comment at you for, uh, someone

337
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,860
who I respect a lot said, personally, I feel like the infatuation with

338
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,100
UI tests, these, my words is great, is a manifestation of Conway's law.

339
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,620
Conway's law is what it says your organization will match your architecture.

340
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,900
So when you hire a bunch of S debts, you end up people who will

341
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,500
write them because they own them.

342
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,500
Which becomes status-cool overall, because people associate QA testing with

343
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,900
rights tests and the most common ones that anyone with a QA title write up

344
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,900
end up being UI tests.

345
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,500
So it's a going back to, this brings us back to the article because we have

346
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,180
testers and because testers don't want to do bullshit testing, they end up

347
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,700
writing a bunch of UI automation because it's almost what that's what

348
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,820
they're expected to do.

349
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,690
We have this maybe I'll hypothesize here.

350
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:09,810
We have a self-fulfilling prophecy where we have a bunch of these fragile UI tests

351
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,290
cause that's what the testers are supposed to, these testers are supposed

352
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,570
to write and it circles and it's one of the circles of hell.

353
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,720
Right.

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,360
It's essentially, we have to do this.

355
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,320
Like if you boil it down, it's like we have to do this

356
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,640
because we've always done it.

357
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,760
Yes.

358
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,440
Right.

359
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,680
Which is wrong.

360
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,040
One of the software's, uh, wonderful tautologies.

361
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,440
So what makes this whole thing more interesting,

362
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,400
rewinding the stack is someone on our Slack channel group, which you can go to

363
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
modern testing.org and find the link.

364
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,880
It works for at least 25 more days.

365
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Cause I just updated it.

366
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,130
And thank you to those who remind me when it's, I don't know why my reminders

367
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,010
aren't working, but remind me to update the link from Slack, et cetera.

368
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,500
So someone posted a link from the U S Bureau of labor statistics, which I found

369
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,380
fascinating and contrary to something you Brent said five minutes ago, where you said

370
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,900
that eventually software testing will be at a point where there's so few, we can

371
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,700
consider it dead, what they're showing with what the U S Bureau of labor

372
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,900
statistics shows is that software testing as an occupation, as a dedicated

373
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,420
occupation will grow by 25% between 2021 and 2031.

374
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,720
Okay.

375
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,360
Now what's missing from that is software development overall growing by, you know,

376
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,040
a hundred percent and it's growing by 25% or is, uh, you know, I don't have that,

377
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,160
the full context of that number, but what this says is we're going to have

378
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,350
another 400,000 testers in the U S that we have right now in 10 years.

379
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:58,930
Um, will we see, I think that the thing that's interesting is the prevailing

380
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:04,410
assumption in, and this is, this is the thing I guess I would question is that

381
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,810
when, when that article tracks that trend, right.

382
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:16,050
To what degree are these testers actually doing the work that, uh, we are

383
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,240
accustomed to them doing, right?

384
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,320
Um, it's like, even the article you sent, uh, talks about, right.

385
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,280
We're going to be less software testers and more quality engineers.

386
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,240
Actually, I'm going to backtrack this whole thing.

387
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,480
I'm going to leave this part in the podcast, but I just looked closer here.

388
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,300
And nevermind as Rose, as Roseanne, Rosanna, Dan may have said at one point,

389
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,820
the article actually shows the page is actually showing statistics for,

390
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,820
they've grouped software developers, quality assurance analysts and testers

391
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,820
into one group, saying that entire group's growing 25%.

392
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,140
So maybe, maybe it's wrong.

393
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,500
I don't, we don't, I don't have the breakdown to get it right.

394
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:03,890
Got it.

395
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,490
So we'll continue looking at this data.

396
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,210
I think it's interesting.

397
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,810
I think if you look at the industry, you know, maybe it's, I don't know,

398
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,650
I don't know what to think here, but worth looking at,

399
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,130
look worth doing research.

400
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,090
Again, I don't think testing is going away immediately.

401
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,050
I don't think any organization should fire their testers because they've

402
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,410
heard that not having testers makes you faster.

403
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,260
And I know you don't believe that for it either, but we do believe that as

404
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,780
teams get better at delivery, that the need for that dedicated testing

405
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,380
specialist, uh, decreases and in some cases it is not needed.

406
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
And that's something that was saying forever, no new information.

407
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Let's go on.

408
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,120
Okay.

409
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,600
Fair enough.

410
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,200
Yeah.

411
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,520
Fair enough.

412
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,440
All right.

413
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,040
Anything else to add on that, Brent?

414
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:53,760
Yeah.

415
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,520
Let's just look at the article, right?

416
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,080
And just to go through it quickly, they're saying recording playback,

417
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,160
DevOps and agile development.

418
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,680
Wait.

419
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:12,320
Uh, the one important thing I think that is missing from here is fast feedback loops.

420
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,600
They talk about agile developments, but they're specifically talking about

421
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,200
testing early and often making it something continuous or discrete, right?

422
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,950
But the thing is the real secret about agile development is adaptability.

423
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,830
You don't waste your time on things that don't matter.

424
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,110
Like there's, there's, there is one exercise I just did recently with,

425
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,270
with my own team where, uh, we're building a whole new product and I put

426
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:48,590
them in a room, created a basically very much, um, Eric Ries style, right?

427
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,750
We, we designed an MVP.

428
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,310
We created, uh, we identified early adopters, started putting them in a

429
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,350
room and getting their feedback.

430
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:05,590
And now I just sit back and, and my team doesn't argue with me anymore around,

431
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,750
Oh, we got to do this.

432
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,230
Right.

433
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,830
Because they're hearing it from the customer directly.

434
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:16,470
As we've, as we've set in the, in the MTP principles, the customer is the only one

435
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,270
qualified and I can see it from my own team's behavior that they realize that

436
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,750
cause everything else has been theory.

437
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,750
Let's, let's drill in on that a bit.

438
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,310
Sure.

439
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:31,150
I have been, I have kept my Eric Ries book on my desk a lot recently because

440
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,350
I've been quoting it a lot and holding it up and showing pictures of it.

441
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:41,150
I hate even talking about agile as a thing because it's just been so bastardized

442
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,940
and, and screwed up, but it's hard.

443
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,020
I want to talk about fast feedback loops and being adaptive being lean and

444
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,460
being lean and learning and being the, the value of the engineering

445
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,800
effort being in learning and having some discussions around, you know, what

446
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,160
that means there is some fear sometimes to deliver something that is not perfect.

447
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,160
And then I just happened to read an article today.

448
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,080
I didn't link to it anywhere, but it talked about perfect being, didn't say

449
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,100
perfect being the enemy of good, but you're never going to be perfect

450
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,360
release now and learn.

451
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,010
And someone said to me, which is, well, I'll tell you what I said in a second.

452
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:30,880
But I talk, I was talking about doing a release with just to a couple teams.

453
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,720
Didn't have a lot of oomph, but would generate a lot of organizational

454
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,680
learning via the onboarding process via via a whole bunch of things.

455
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:45,730
And the comment I heard in a discussion was you only get one chance

456
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,270
to make a good first impression.

457
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,910
And I'm curious, I'll tell you what I said in a second.

458
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,790
While I agree with the statement in its original context, I do not

459
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,430
think it applies to software.

460
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,280
Oh, no.

461
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,280
Uh, okay.

462
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,800
Is it my turn to do to reply?

463
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,200
Go ahead, Brett.

464
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,960
Yeah.

465
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
So yeah, you're right.

466
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,800
You only get a good, you only get one chance to make a good first impression.

467
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,240
Okay.

468
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,490
But my counter would be, all right.

469
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,640
Uh, what's your evidence that the second impression isn't good enough or

470
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
the third or the fourth or the fifth.

471
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,760
When, when I see that, right.

472
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,440
I remember back in the day and I pretty certain I've talked about this.

473
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,480
When, when Google's first came out and was before I went to Bing, right.

474
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,680
People were like, ah, Google's getting into the OS.

475
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,160
Like what a bunch of idiots.

476
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:50,520
Like we have 40 quadrillion lines of code and you know, uh, we have more

477
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,960
man hours baked into windows and T that have ever existed in the planet history.

478
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,720
Right.

479
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,080
They were just saying like, that's an impossible task.

480
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,520
Why would, why would Google do that?

481
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,760
And I remember my manager specifically talking about the search engine and

482
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,360
they're like, it's buggy AF.

483
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,030
Why the quality is just awful.

484
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,070
People are going to abandon it.

485
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,230
And I remember talking to him and I'm like, yeah, you're full of crap, dude.

486
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,030
You do not understand what you're talking about.

487
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:26,230
Cause if that were true, the stock price would be tanking.

488
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,390
And what ended up happening is Google, uh, because they were, did a very good

489
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,830
job on their telemetry, they've did a very good job on fast feedback, the

490
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:43,000
experience that customers had the first time through, yeah, it was buggy.

491
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,080
But you know what?

492
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,600
The second time through, all of those bugs were gone.

493
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,880
And the second time through a lot harder to find a new bug.

494
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,320
And that second time through was not that long after the first time through.

495
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,120
It wasn't, it was just like two weeks later.

496
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,600
And so what ended up happening is those customers did not walk away with a

497
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,480
view of this product, this shit.

498
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,110
They walked away with a view.

499
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:14,620
The quality is visibly improving in front of their eyes, right?

500
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,740
They walked away with a net positive, not a net negative, but the secret

501
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,300
is the fast feedback loop.

502
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:21,780
Yes.

503
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,100
If the bug stays there for three years.

504
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:25,940
Yeah.

505
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,720
And even the bug, it's like, this would be great if you could do X.

506
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,480
Yeah.

507
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,640
And then all of a sudden it does X in a week and then it does right.

508
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
Some Y and two weeks and X and Y and Z in three weeks.

509
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,800
Like, Oh my God, this just gets better and better.

510
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,120
I want to keep going back and using this.

511
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,200
It is so hard from my experience.

512
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
I have not yet, maybe you have.

513
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,090
I have not yet found a way to convince people that, that what they are

514
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,650
proposing is significantly more risky than what I am proposing, but it's

515
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:07,690
really hard to convince them of that without them experiencing it from my ex from.

516
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:08,610
Right.

517
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,730
I could send them to Ryan, uh, Ryan Irnsons book, right?

518
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,130
But even then it's, it's so challenging to battle.

519
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,850
Well, yeah, that's a great thing, but it's all theoretically, or, you know,

520
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,970
my products, the snowflake or, or those types of things.

521
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,090
Those arguments are difficult to push back on.

522
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:26,850
Yeah.

523
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:32,690
So when I heard someone say you only get in regarding a software release, you

524
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,570
only get one chance to make a first impression, my immediate answer is that

525
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:43,990
phrase can go, I agree with the sentiment reps, not it's okay.

526
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,710
It was a conversation with someone, uh, who took it.

527
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,550
They didn't, they weren't offended.

528
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,950
Ah, got it.

529
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,910
The, the, the, the answer was something like done that phrase as

530
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,070
and then we had a discussion around why.

531
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,190
So there is, and this is really a learning.

532
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,190
This is a gap like in crossing the chasm sort of gap or a learning curve.

533
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,550
You see the same thing come up and people argue against us when we say

534
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,430
only the customer can evaluate quality.

535
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:21,290
It is difficult if you haven't done it yet to make the jump from we

536
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,730
got to get this right to we got to learn as fast as we can.

537
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,410
We got to have that fast feedback loop.

538
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,250
It's a jump teams have to make like we have to get this as they

539
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,170
can think back in the old days.

540
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,570
We would test the crap.

541
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,050
We would do the bug count coming in as less.

542
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:36,530
Okay.

543
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,610
We can ship shipping that way now is irresponsible.

544
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,770
And, but it takes like, look at the argument we get against that.

545
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,290
Like it's important for me as the tester to evaluate product risk

546
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,610
for my stakeholders and make sure I'm making the best.

547
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,970
They will do a crap ton of work and the customers will get a product.

548
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,170
And as Eric Reese would say, and I don't know if I'm a disciple, a

549
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,210
follower or a fan or a reader or a believer in Eric Reese, but what

550
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,330
he would say, he would say, should, and he has said, show me

551
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,650
a product with no bugs and I'll show you a product that shipped too late.

552
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,610
Yes.

553
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,850
Or still hasn't shipped.

554
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,130
No.

555
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,450
So it's a jump to make, right?

556
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,330
You go from, okay, I, this has to be, I have to do, I have to do all this

557
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,970
work to make sure I do my due diligence to, we have the ability to, if

558
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,770
we, if something's wrong, I can change it in 10 minutes in a, in an hour.

559
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,760
Versus and just making that jump and being able to say the focus is on fixing

560
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,380
forward versus fixing ahead.

561
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,500
That's a big jump that a lot of teams need to make.

562
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,300
I think it's probably the most, maybe one of the most difficult jumps to make in,

563
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,980
I hate to use the word agile in adaptive delivery.

564
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,940
I'm going to call adaptive delivery with the capital A and probably also the one

565
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,340
blocking the most teams and the one that gives teams the most benefit.

566
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,740
When you learn as a software organization to deliver, we do, man.

567
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:16,250
When you learn as a software organization to deliver with fast feedback loops and

568
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,170
count on fast feedback loops and rely and use those as part of the way you deliver.

569
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,960
That's a big, that's a, that's a jump.

570
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,280
That's a, that's a lock step jump in your maturity and your capability and your quality.

571
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,160
Okay.

572
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:35,960
Given that you just said that hold on to hold on to that thought because a well

573
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,960
known living expert in testing, uh, did a comment in that same thread.

574
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,960
I wish to share that comment.

575
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,120
Testing is not quality engineering, right?

576
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,200
Again, this is a well-known testing expert.

577
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:52,960
Okay.

578
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,520
True.

579
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,280
Testing is learning about the product so that the people designing, developing,

580
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:07,640
and managing it can decide whether the product they've got is the product they want.

581
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,800
Okay.

582
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,200
Yeah.

583
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,960
I just hate that because I don't, I don't want to go into.

584
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

585
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,800
I want you to remember what you just said about Eric Reese.

586
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,080
My point isn't around where you and I agree on tests as the

587
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,000
people who provide information.

588
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,440
Yeah.

589
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:27,680
Right.

590
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,400
You and I agree that that's bullshit.

591
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,160
That's total crap.

592
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:41,560
But this well-known testing expert is claiming that testing is learning about the product so that people, the people designing it, developing and

593
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,360
management, managing it can, can decide whether the product they got is the product they want.

594
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:47,960
Okay.

595
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,520
Okay.

596
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:59,360
Given what you said about Eric Reese and in my view, the testing experts own definition of testing is testing jobs going away.

597
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,860
God, I sure as hell hope so.

598
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,940
Well, no, they should be the proper kind of testing.

599
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,260
They should be modern testing.

600
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,380
They should be experimentation testing.

601
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,340
The way you do what that person described is analytics, data analysis, fast feedback loops.

602
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:22,060
You don't do it by holding onto the product and, and, and making sure it gets your once over for your stakeholders to make the

603
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,540
decision on whether it releases or not.

604
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,460
But my, my,

605
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:35,340
apply what he said to the actual real type of testing as tests, real testing from an experimentation and metrics point of view.

606
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,180
And I actually think it's kind of accurate.

607
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,140
I don't know.

608
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,860
Okay.

609
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,460
It's so depends on how you stretch it.

610
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:48,380
That cause my view, my view is the Eric Reese model, right?

611
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:55,540
That migrates over to the, to the product manager's job or, or it's a portion of the developer's job.

612
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,660
Sure.

613
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:05,580
It's like having it, having an in-house person who, who again is not the customer.

614
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:14,620
It's the ad, not even the champion of the customer as, as your, um, meamish slide details.

615
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,300
It, I'm like, why would I ever hire such a person described on that one?

616
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:29,700
I would rather have my people have direct connection with the customer and not have some, some in between like the product.

617
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,860
The product I want is not the one on paper.

618
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,820
The product I want is the one that actually adds a value stream that I can make a stable business plan off of.

619
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,780
It's it, that is an anti-modern testing comment.

620
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,260
Unless you squint and stretch it to be, uh, testing as experimentation.

621
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:54,130
And then of course, this, um, because only the customer can tell you if it's the product they want your stakeholders can't.

622
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,320
Right.

623
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:07,440
And, and certainly having, having someone in house and unless they're the ones going out and talking to, to the customer, they're not going to be able to do that.

624
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,960
But I'm going to tell you that job has traditionally been viewed as marketing, not testing.

625
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,120
So, so this is the same thing.

626
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,720
And again, this is, and sorry, and listeners actually not sorry, but this is where we're at.

627
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,760
This is a conversation we've had the people who want to be doing the testing like Brent and I used to do in the nineties.

628
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,680
Want, they don't want to do anything different.

629
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,160
They want to test like it's 1997 and that's fine.

630
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,360
They're very good testers for 1997.

631
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:48,240
The world needed those in 1997 software, most software, much software is delivered differently today and no longer benefits from that kind of tester.

632
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,120
Yes.

633
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:49,960
Yes.

634
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,240
I mean, we're not here.

635
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,840
Well, as we've said many times before, we're not here to kill testing.

636
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,080
We're basically saying the motor, like that's the way the wind's blowing.

637
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:11,160
What's rough here is that Brent and I getting going back to Myers Briggs part horoscope part science, mostly horoscope, but INTPs we hate inefficiency.

638
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,640
And when we see that we see this again, fast feedback loops.

639
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,160
We love them because they're super efficient.

640
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,000
When we see little blockers come into that feedback loop, why am I waiting for this?

641
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,480
We get really, really mad.

642
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:22,640
Yes.

643
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,400
No need for it.

644
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,200
What the hell are we waiting on?

645
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:38,840
I told, I have told my team, done is my second favorite four letter word and wait is absolutely my least favorite four letter word.

646
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,800
I like that.

647
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,520
I like that.

648
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:51,040
We weaved around that and got some good segues back and forth, repeated a lot of the stuff, but honestly, it's good stuff to repeat.

649
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,400
You know, every podcast isn't about the same stuff.

650
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:03,580
We talk about stuff differently, hoping that some of this will stick for those that maybe haven't got it yet.

651
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,860
At least one person someday.

652
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,620
One person someday.

653
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:07,860
Yeah.

654
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,220
I, it's tough.

655
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,300
We're not, we're just trying to tell stories and get people to understand why we think the way we do.

656
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,900
And here we are.

657
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,780
Testing is maybe a dying profession.

658
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,540
Maybe not.

659
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,580
We may never know.

660
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:31,610
There may be testers, like as you called out in 25% growth in tech field, there was right.

661
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,890
The AI bit is interesting.

662
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,770
Well, if I could hypothesize on growth in general, and again, the, the paper was everyone.

663
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,730
I think tech is going to grow quickly.

664
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,170
I think, you know, that original statistical study was 21.

665
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,930
We're seeing generative AI become a very interesting thing.

666
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,250
Interesting thing to many companies.

667
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:07,730
We are, I think there's, like I've said before, we are on the edge of some significant advances in software.

668
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,170
I'm not going to give away spoilers.

669
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,890
I listened to an, listen to the audio book of The Origin on my hike a few weeks ago.

670
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,210
And there's an AI in that book and it's, I'm not going to give away anything.

671
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,330
The book is the audio book.

672
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,530
The book is not great, but fun, but there's an AI in there.

673
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,290
It makes you think about things AIs could do.

674
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:30,810
And then I watched the Mission Impossible movie, which has an AI in it last night.

675
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,890
And it's, it's funny.

676
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:39,600
I think we're going to look back in 10 years and look at what AI actually is then.

677
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,160
And just laugh at what fiction made it out to be here in 2023.

678
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
That'll be interesting.

679
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,000
But like I said, AI isn't taking jobs away.

680
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,840
So people that use AIR, I think it's going to be a lot of people.

681
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:05,120
Please don't call them prompt engineers, but there's a lot of people building generative AI models to help solve significant customer problems or new problems we haven't thought about.

682
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,150
But maybe with fewer engineers than we would today.

683
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,630
So it's, I think there's a shift.

684
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:21,910
Not only is there a growth of tech, but there's a shift in what people are doing in order to deliver value that solves customer problems in the next 10 years.

685
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,050
I don't know.

686
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:29,210
10 years ago, we could not have imagined what's going on now, nor will.

687
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,410
So these, these predictions on growth are, they're, they're our best guess.

688
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,250
I do predict right now that there will be churn in the industry.

689
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,290
You know what?

690
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:47,370
I'm, I'm slightly less pessimistic on this than I was a little while ago.

691
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:59,730
Like, um, my team, we are a few weeks away from shipping our first actual, uh, in the end product that is heavily reliant on LOM.

692
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,640
And, and I will tell you, like there's language I shared a little while ago, right?

693
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,840
That LLM is kind of a schizophrenic.

694
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,800
It's some part, it's a genie one part, it's a parrot and another part is an SME.

695
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:22,320
And so now there's like, so even language, like I would call up when my ICs and I'm like, Oh my God, the genie is pissing me off.

696
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
It's, it's like you, you add.

697
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,360
I changed the sentence from is something, something to our something, something, right?

698
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:38,640
It was grammatically incorrect, but just that one tense change completely changed the output.

699
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,880
It's fascinating, but I will absolutely agree.

700
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:51,760
Those who don't join or understand this, this, this change and have, have the ability to quickly learn.

701
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,200
If they get behind, I don't see how they will ever catch up.

702
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,310
I see the way the industry is going forward.

703
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:16,950
The people who are, I think the next most at risk of being laid off are those who have not figured out how to learn and execute off of those learnings quickly.

704
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,230
Absolutely.

705
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:31,150
And one thing I talk about a lot, even in, I talk about a lot, I won't give examples is the need to be a generalist in software is just becoming more and more important.

706
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,390
I've been talking to a lot of new and career are about to be new and career folks.

707
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:43,630
And I bring up the fact that I spent the first five, seven, eight years of my career writing in C only.

708
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,980
Just wrote C code and eventually added some assembly.

709
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:59,700
That was about it for the first, you know, seven years of my career, maybe more today, working on software today, writing in one language all day, probably getting rare.

710
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:14,190
And then in addition to that, you're not just writing code, you're gluing technologies together, your, your configuring web services and, and, you know, yaml and gluing this to that and doing an API here to

711
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,110
compress this to there.

712
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,790
It's changing.

713
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:31,380
And I think with generative AI and, you know, who knows what other tools coming on that the ability to be able to do a bunch of different things comfortably is going to be a key in being successful in the long term.

714
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,300
Yeah.

715
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,600
Agree.

716
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,400
You're making a face.

717
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,040
I know that maybe I'm, maybe I'm way wrong.

718
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,120
No, you're, you're, you are totally correct.

719
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,560
Cool, man.

720
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,180
Well, let's do the mailbag next time.

721
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,720
If we get it, unless something else comes up.

722
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,720
I don't know, but I think, uh, we talked a lot about it.

723
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Lots to think about.

724
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,720
I think we talked about some old stuff and got some new ideas in there.

725
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,920
Uh, we'll see how good it ends up when I finished editing, but probably pretty good.

726
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,080
Probably this is the bed best podcast from AB testing.

727
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,440
You listened to, um, one of the best AB testing podcasts of today.

728
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,360
Right.

729
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,720
If let me do, actually we just, we have it just a few more minutes.

730
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,040
bonus material.

731
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,600
I'm trying to find the article.

732
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,280
I lost it.

733
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,680
One more thing that the test expert mentioned.

734
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,680
I would question if test experts, something that someone has a title, someone

735
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,320
assigns to themselves, something that's assigned by a community or like, where

736
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,440
does, how does one become a test expert?

737
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,360
Well, in this particular case, I'm, I'm leveraging the fact that by the, by the,

738
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:53,710
the people who invoke quotes of the test expert, I'm a short answer.

739
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,510
Community is, is the one I'm using.

740
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,030
Sure.

741
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,070
Feed me the quote.

742
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,140
All right.

743
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,740
So they quoted something from the article.

744
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:09,780
Quality engineers will need to ensure business factor quality into every aspect

745
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,580
of the SDLC and increasingly the value stream management process.

746
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:20,760
And the expert came back with three substances.

747
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,490
That's not what testers do.

748
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,650
That's what management does.

749
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,070
Testing is not a dying profession.

750
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:30,290
Okay.

751
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,450
Again, straw, man's against straw, man's.

752
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:33,290
It's fine.

753
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,010
I'm just like, okay.

754
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,440
If testing isn't going to care about the, the, the value stream management or the

755
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,720
impact of the business, right.

756
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,000
Principle number one and, and testing's job is essentially to be the internal

757
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,040
expert that the team has gotten the product they want it honestly, I don't

758
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,920
see how, how they can conclude test is not a dying profession.

759
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,490
Well, right.

760
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:09,210
Because there are so matter, so many better ways in today's world to achieve those goals.

761
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,650
Well, this is the thing that, and again, we're going to end here, but this is what

762
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,770
bugs me the most about some of the experts is they pride themselves on

763
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:23,570
critical thinking, yet they can't take a step back and say, what are some ways

764
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,290
which this may or may not be true?

765
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:30,410
What are some, is this, is this thing I'm talking about is the execution

766
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,970
of this, the only way this statement can be true.

767
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,410
And that's the statement that's being made here.

768
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,890
And you and I are saying, Hey, there are other ways that may be more efficient.

769
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,240
And that comes up a lot when we talk about these things, they say, nope,

770
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
that won't work for me.

771
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,280
And I, like when I say teams are shipping software without writing UI tests or

772
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,480
teams are shipping software without having dedicated testers, they go, nope,

773
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,400
that won't work.

774
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,440
I take a step back.

775
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,880
Look, teams are doing this.

776
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,560
Can you imagine a scenario?

777
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,200
This is true because it is.

778
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,280
So check your bias, check your teals digging in.

779
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,680
Think about a scenario.

780
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,600
This could be true and apply some fricking critical thinking and figure out

781
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,320
if you need to adjust the way you're thinking, can you, what they're really

782
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,840
saying in my context, which I refuse to change any views on this statement

783
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,720
is true or false, right?

784
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,280
This is from people who say they, they're driven by context and

785
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,040
they're critical thinkers, but they're not applying those things when talking

786
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,200
about subjects like this, because if this were true, if software testing

787
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,800
was a dying profession, and this is the end, it's one, it's worse.

788
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,680
Like it's bad.

789
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,640
If you are, if you think the only thing you could ever do is software testing,

790
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,080
you see this article, you go, well, that can't be true.

791
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,480
And I refuse to believe it because my livelihood is on this.

792
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,840
And now think you're in a position where you're an expert and your

793
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,320
livelihood is based on people being in this profession that cannot die.

794
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,160
Otherwise you don't, you can't make any money because you refuse to do anything

795
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,000
else, of course you're going to dig your heels in, of course you're not

796
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,960
going to use a critical thinking.

797
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,720
Of course you're not going to apply any context or perspective.

798
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,120
Well, it was a Mark Twain quote, I forget it.

799
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,120
It was something around a man's opinion.

800
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,560
Uh, it's more wittier than what I'm doing, but a man's opinion is directly

801
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,040
related to their incentive, right?

802
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,040
It's essentially something new comes out.

803
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,120
Their opinion of that new thing is going to be directly related to how well that

804
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,680
enables them to continue to do their job.

805
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,080
Right.

806
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,360
That was, that was delirally quoted.

807
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,840
But I would say, you know, behavior, my quote is, uh, behavior comes from motivation.

808
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,000
I was going to work with that motivation.

809
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,920
This one, it's crystal clear what that is.

810
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,720
I don't know the Mark Twain quilt, but one of our listeners can find it

811
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,280
and post it on our Slack group.

812
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,280
Yes.

813
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,800
All right.

814
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,560
Okay.

815
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,080
That has been episode 184.

816
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,840
Believe it or not.

817
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
The countdown to 200 continues.

818
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,710
I'm Mr.

819
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,070
Weasel.

820
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,860
And I am.
