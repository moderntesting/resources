1
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,870
Hey everyone and hello Brent.

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,030
Hi Alan, how are you doing?

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,030
I'm doing great.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,070
I am actually feeling excellent given the fact that I just flew in from Reykjavik last

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,070
night.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,910
Landed around 6pm.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,320
And what foreign country is this in?

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Dude, you have the geography knowledge of an American.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,880
You know, someone's got to keep the stereotype alive.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,440
The Reykjavik is the capital of Iceland.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
Oh cool.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,000
I knew it was the biggest city in Iceland and I knew Iceland didn't have that many people

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,780
but I wasn't prepared for how small Reykjavik is.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,780
What could I compare it to?

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,140
I was thinking about that the whole flight home.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,700
I took a picture so I could think about it some more.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
I don't know what the population is, I'm not going to look it up.

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,340
One of the three can do that.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,600
But I was like in the tallest building in Reykjavik with 8 story hotel.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Cool.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,800
And it is small.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,840
I don't have a good comparison.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:21,910
It is amazing how, this is probably too philosophical for our podcast, but I find it amazing how

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,870
life always seems to find a way.

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,870
It does man.

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:31,950
Right, you're in the middle of, there's multiple middles of nowhere where suddenly communities

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,310
just start popping up.

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,870
Yep, yep, yep.

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:43,110
Hey, I was in, I got to do the right segue slash pin here because I was there for a meeting

30
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,790
with my manager and my peers to talk about people and how they're doing, go over some

31
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,950
strategy stuff, basically a two and a half day off site.

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,600
Probably the best off site of my entire career.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,050
Was there candy?

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,610
Yes, in the form of fermented grapes and a glass.

35
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,170
Oh, well there you go.

36
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,650
Not only are we super aligned on what we're doing, I mean, if there's one thing I could

37
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,770
go to improve the last three days, was I'm a big believer that great innovation, actually

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,930
this happened at one time, that breakthroughs happened from disagreement and having an argument

39
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,250
people you trust, it's okay to have that argument.

40
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,730
I think great things come from that.

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,930
Now that I think back, one of the great insights we had and the thing, this idea

42
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:38,470
that just exploded upon us as a few things converged, did come from argument.

43
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,510
So, wow, it was great.

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,710
But one thing during the people discussion, I want to pin, because something came up that's

45
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,470
highly related to the principle we're going to discuss today.

46
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,470
Okay.

47
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,830
So I'm going to go make a note on that on the whiteboard so I don't forget where we keep

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,830
our notes.

49
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,550
And then, Phil Miam, what have you been up to since the last recording of A-B testing?

50
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,430
Oh, by the way, A-B testing is ...

51
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,430
One of the things on my backlog is to actually record a proper intro.

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,390
I think I'm going to change the music and do a proper, fancy podcast intro.

53
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,230
I don't approve of changing the music.

54
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,030
Okay, I'll figure something out.

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,460
I got to figure out how to ... I want to do a proper intro for A-B testing so I don't

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,220
forget to say crap and we can just start off talking about crap.

57
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,750
Are you going to do your best practiced DJ radio voice?

58
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,590
A-B testing.

59
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,830
A-B testing, let me tell you.

60
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,830
Wow!

61
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,270
No, no, I will do something though.

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,310
Anyway, if this is your first episode, probably not the best place to start.

63
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,670
Although if you want to listen, go ahead, because we're talking about modern testing

64
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,670
principles out of the podcast.

65
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,430
We talk a lot about software development, software quality, software testing, Agile

66
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,670
software, leadership, management, bunnies and squirrels, and this thing we've been

67
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,830
talking about for the last, holy crud, like six months, eight months, a year, year and

68
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,830
a half?

69
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,830
At least a year.

70
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,830
A thing called modern testing.

71
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,950
And modern testing isn't modern in the sense that it's flying cars, it's just modern

72
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,670
as compared to traditional testing.

73
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,710
Anyway, I'm going to let you read the back of the Kim Koehner book while I go

74
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,710
put a note on the board.

75
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,270
So, Brent, what have you been up to?

76
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Nothing much.

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Okay.

78
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Yeah.

79
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
All right.

80
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:37,660
There is very little excitement in my life at the moment baseball season's done.

81
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
You mentioned that last time.

82
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Yeah, I know.

83
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
You've talked about this before.

84
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,660
Agreed.

85
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,340
Things I can't talk about, I mean, there is a lot of really exciting stuff happening

86
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,340
on the work front.

87
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Yeah, I got some of that too.

88
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,180
Well, at least in mind I can chat with you a little bit about after we stop

89
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
recording.

90
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,180
Yep.

91
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,230
And you probably have secret stuff because you work at a big secret company.

92
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,910
I'm sure you have secrets too.

93
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,910
I do.

94
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,910
I do.

95
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,910
I have plenty of secrets.

96
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,910
Oh, I have stories to tell.

97
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,270
Yeah, I can't bring them up now.

98
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,750
But anyway, sorry about that.

99
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,070
So your trip to Iceland, was that a work trip or a?

100
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,990
Were you listening to me?

101
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,190
We just had a three day off site in Iceland.

102
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,580
Oh, right.

103
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,900
No, I generally don't listen to you.

104
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,900
Holy fudge sickles.

105
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,340
Man, what's the name of the podcast?

106
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,020
It's the 88th episode of A.B.

107
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
Testing.

108
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,060
And why don't we just dive right in to the seventh of the modern testing

109
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,060
principles.

110
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,060
Is that cool?

111
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
That's cool.

112
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,060
All right.

113
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,580
You can read modern testing principles on modern testing dot org.

114
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,420
And this is maybe a record and that we're only about six minutes in once I edit out

115
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,500
Brent's brain farts.

116
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,880
And we are actually talking about the topic of the day, which is fantastic because we

117
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,320
have a whiteboard full of notes.

118
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:03,160
OK, number seven is the one that to me is becoming less and less controversial.

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,880
Just absolutely makes sense.

120
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,640
But it still causes a few heads to turn.

121
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,020
What do you mean to you is less your observation is no.

122
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:19,000
In my context, it's like it's making where it made sense before it is rock, freakin solid.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,840
You could not convince me to back off on the second part of this one, which is the

124
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,040
part that people see as controversial.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,960
No, we're going to dive into that.

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
I feel like I'm talking around it.

127
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,360
Let me read it and then we'll talk about crap.

128
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,120
You have a place you want to start from notes on the board so we can get now start with

129
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
reading the principle.

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,520
OK, here we go.

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,700
Principle number seven.

132
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,680
We expand testing abilities and know how across the team, understanding that this may

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,640
reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist.

134
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:56,320
So with this principle, we can focus on the first half and this ties in with principle

135
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,400
number four about the quality culture and driving the quality culture on the team.

136
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,200
But where this one is different, this is about for me, make sure on the same page

137
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
here.

138
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,240
This one's about making sure the team knows the test approaches, test techniques.

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,020
They know teaching them that bugs lurk around boundaries, teaching them how to design chips

140
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,420
for designing test automation.

141
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,180
Let me take a different approach.

142
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,620
OK, let's just take the controversy head on.

143
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,780
But I dude, I said let's take care of the first part first.

144
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,660
We can talk about why the controversy isn't controversial most of the episode.

145
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,100
But what is the essence of how does this maybe you're going to get to this.

146
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,300
But I am all right.

147
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,580
I'm going to let you go.

148
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,460
But you kind of principle seven.

149
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
Yes.

150
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:53,260
So the question to me is essentially it's the final straw in I think the modern testing.

151
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,700
Well it's the final principle in the modern testing principles.

152
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:05,230
But the observant amongst the most observant readers of the modern testing principles will

153
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,610
notice that we don't actually address testing until principle seven.

154
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,110
That is true.

155
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:25,480
And what principle seven is essentially stating is the modern tester doesn't test.

156
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
In a way.

157
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
In a way.

158
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Yeah.

159
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,280
Because again I stand by our statement that modern testing is a transient role.

160
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm sorry a modern tester is a transient role.

161
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,660
Meaning they are someone who helps the team adopt modern testing principles.

162
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,980
So for me essentially what number seven says is everything else above is executed so well

163
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,760
and the quality culture does cover some testing as well.

164
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,300
But the team understands testing well enough across the team spread throughout the team

165
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,110
that they may not need that dedicated testing specialist.

166
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,110
It's a culmination.

167
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,510
There's purposeful and developed and careful overlap between the principles.

168
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,710
They build on each other both sequentially and randomly.

169
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,870
But number seven as you mentioned it's the pinnacle.

170
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,310
It says if you are a team following modern testing principles and I remember modern testing

171
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,070
isn't about testing as much as it's about how you approach quality in software development.

172
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,390
It's modern testing as opposed to traditional testing.

173
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,250
And if you follow those principles and the team gets what testing and quality are you

174
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,450
may not need a dedicated testing specialist and that makes perfect sense.

175
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,170
I think in this episode you're going to be playing good cop the entire time.

176
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,210
Therefore I will play back up.

177
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,490
One of the comments one of the pieces of feedback I've seen a lot of people will read

178
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,370
number seven and run the risk of bit flipping the whole modern testing principles.

179
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,570
I agree.

180
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,920
And saying oh my God.

181
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,720
Brent and Alan are just on the same.

182
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,720
They will say we don't respect the craft.

183
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,240
Or no we're on the same meme.

184
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,480
This is what I'm talking about the same test is dead meme.

185
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,870
And one of the things I want to say is that I'm actually we're not saying that.

186
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:33,960
I have said I think it's on its way and the thing that I will say is in this particular

187
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:43,830
case you can you can either be the butterfly or you can be the wind.

188
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:52,430
So those who interpret this as a test is dead message and respond from fear like the one

189
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:59,130
thing I will say on that front is like first off fear actually isn't real.

190
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,930
This is super philosophical but fear isn't real.

191
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,410
It's about what might be not what is.

192
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:14,490
And so the intent on this one going back to the first half of your of the principle

193
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,930
is like no you can control your own destiny.

194
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:26,610
If you if you understand the prior six principles you will understand that your job and your

195
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:34,810
business is better suited by you taking up the role and spreading the knowledge of how

196
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,930
to do the testing activity.

197
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,330
And as that testing activity is spread throughout your organization not only will the business

198
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:51,510
benefit but one of the consequences a testing specialist just won't be needed.

199
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,910
One of the things I've noticed from those who dig in their heels and say this is who may

200
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,590
reject this principle or modern testing principles because of this principle is there is a belief

201
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:07,270
among many in testing and I'll interject and get my stack correct.

202
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:15,350
I am happily blown away by how many people agree this is the right direction or tell me

203
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,870
we're already doing this.

204
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,750
Thanks for putting a name for what we're doing.

205
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,070
It is not some fad that you it's not an echo chamber of you and I talking about this

206
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,070
thing.

207
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,070
It is actually happening.

208
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,830
It was happening without us.

209
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,630
We are just trying to put names to the things we see that are happening and encourage others

210
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,790
to go in this direction.

211
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:40,390
So the fear or the worry I see the biggest thing that comes to me from people who are

212
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:50,440
digging their heels in on no is they believe that testing skills are a unique thing that

213
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,870
is only learnable and practiceable by people with a unique mindset and people that do

214
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,950
specific areas of practice and they believe that they are I don't want to say special

215
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:07,790
snowflakes you may but they believe they are uniquely suited to software testing and that

216
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:14,350
skill that the developers programmers of code do not have the right air quote mindset to

217
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,870
do testing and what I've found what what shifted me over this direction was I found

218
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:28,140
that teaching developers to test was not only not that hard it was fun for me and it

219
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,500
was fun for the developers I worked with I have done this now on three different teams

220
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,700
and indirectly so now I went through two teams of teaching developers to test and now I am

221
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:45,380
teaching people to teach developers to test and it is it works developers can learn to

222
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:53,100
test it isn't a unique unteachable skill that needs to be done by a dedicated specialist

223
00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:00,780
you know I've been doing this now for so long I'm beginning to forget what it was like when

224
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:11,390
I held that belief like to me is just absolutely clear in my mind that testing is an activity

225
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:20,880
and not a job yes right and for me from a business point of view it's a testing activity

226
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:33,550
that dev not only should and can but must do and when I say must I mean there are so

227
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:42,560
many product related benefits by getting dev on this you end up with a much better design

228
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,760
of the product there's accountability and ownership they're like oh yeah I thought of this test

229
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,720
I want to do this test but accountability ownership just quite honestly I'm gonna say

230
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,200
that those are useless criteria I don't think so when people think of something themselves

231
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,970
they want to do it more the biggest problem I have with accountability this is an aside

232
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,570
the biggest problem I have our podcast we're all yeah the biggest problem I have with

233
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:17,140
the term accountability is that so I have pay attention to simultaneously the word choices

234
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:24,200
people use and then I pay attention to the actions that are associated with those word

235
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,360
choices and what I've come to conclude is that when people the majority of people use

236
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,280
the term accountability what its purpose in life is is to publicly identify who to blame

237
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,370
when it all goes to shit and I don't care about that no I care more about self accountability

238
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,050
I'm not talking I'm not talking about yeah I'm talking about self accountability when

239
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,050
I mentioned that so yeah I don't like that either the I don't even associate that word

240
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,850
that way anymore so the way I would phrase it slightly differently is that once the devs

241
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:05,440
understand this they realize holy crap it's actually not as hard as they thought right

242
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,300
because actually at this point in time the testing has been around for so long there

243
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:18,740
are multiple devs that have been in the in their arena or in their discipline for decades

244
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:26,260
that have never actually owned testing and so to them it's this mysterious burden but

245
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:32,780
when they realize when it gets demystified what you find is that no it's a benefit to

246
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:38,810
them because it allows them to control their own destiny allows them to reduce surprises

247
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:45,050
at the end of the milestone it allows them to control you know how many sleepless nights

248
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:51,930
and weekends are working and gain confidence that when they did their check in it's done

249
00:16:51,930 --> 00:17:01,360
and it's not coming back yes right and so these are these are all strong benefits to to

250
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,600
the actual developer whether it informs you know creates accountability or ownership I don't

251
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,360
know that that's really important but what I do find from the human condition what people

252
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,560
want is to control their own destiny and that's exactly what I'm talking about right

253
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,760
they want to be the wind they don't want to be the butterfly yeah and I could reiterate

254
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,600
and say exactly what I'm talking about so we yeah I want to tell a meta story about

255
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,520
modern testing it's going to lead into this okay I realize that I have to it's actually

256
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,490
going to be beneficial to tell the meta story so of course I talk about modern testing a

257
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,450
lot on this podcast I have never once gone to my team and say here is modern testing

258
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,730
is what we're gonna do some listen to the podcast hey everyone they go yeah we want

259
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:54,690
to do modern testing but what I do on my team instead is make sure that the principles

260
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,690
not in name like follow this principle but it guides what we do and we've been focusing

261
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:07,770
a lot recently on the quality culture and and not just on my team across all of unity

262
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:14,940
one of the things we discussed in our offsite last week is how our people in QA our testers

263
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,480
they are accountable and to use that word again for nurturing as we say in principle

264
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,320
number four that quality culture yep and we talk about the quality culture a lot and

265
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,120
people and they get that everybody everybody all of unity QA is on board with yes we

266
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,040
need to improve the quality culture and here's some approaches on how to do it I

267
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,800
talked to them that's worked on my team everybody's fully on board that's good so one

268
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,280
of the things that came up in the offsite we had a people discussion it's not like a

269
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,080
Microsoft stack ranking we just talk about what people are doing how they're doing the

270
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,600
twist on this is on the potential category we talked about people's potential we talked

271
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,920
we framed it a little bit around how well around leadership skills and how well they

272
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,080
could drive a quality culture or modern testing principles across the org so

273
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,920
that's the main part on how I push or guide the team towards modern testing

274
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,920
principles both on my team and outside of my team but I had it I was a little

275
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,640
afraid to say it out loud but I did and I wasn't too afraid I want to see what

276
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,480
would happen I was ready for a discussion but I when talking about one

277
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,520
of my employees I said pretty much something like this blah blah blah they're

278
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,840
working on this and this is probably the first person on my team first person on

279
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,560
my team who probably won't do any testing as part of their day-to-day job

280
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:41,160
and everybody got it I said okay cool yeah I didn't have to explain that

281
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,480
nobody went what's the it was like okay cool that's great no the I see I see

282
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,320
why you think they're great that's awesome yeah no the fact that you are

283
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,480
basically saying this guy is probably going to be the first across this line

284
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:09,760
and when that happens that is a win for the business right in the fact that that

285
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,290
seems to be universally understood unless your leadership team does what I do and

286
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,010
that is ignores you when you're talking no no no we are good at calling we are

287
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,050
good at calling each other out I think if I would have said that six months ago

288
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:29,130
in our meeting there would have been more discussion but in this case it's

289
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,330
head nods oh that'd be cool yeah awesome it's like you doing the right thing

290
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:40,680
there yeah that's that's great to see in terms of this stuff I mean that that

291
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,000
might be relevant what do you think what do you think because what in

292
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,860
principle seven we're basically saying you know what it doesn't matter if

293
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:59,580
testers is dead or not you doing this shifting the testing activity to the

294
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:07,650
whole team especially the development team and removing the the bottleneck

295
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,520
around the testing specialist that benefits the business sure and what you're

296
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,840
saying is hey you got tacit agreement in your business that either they observe

297
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,330
that or they seek or they observed the promise of it which do you think it is

298
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,210
and how do you think you got there I got there because we took off we loosened

299
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,800
the tourniquet versus ripping off the band-aid we talked about this before

300
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,720
where many teams have failed moving to a no tester team is by ripping off the

301
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,440
band-aid and blood spurts everywhere and people that yep metaphorically this

302
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,360
has been a very gradual change and I believe that's the reason it's working

303
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,640
and I believe that's the way it will work for 99 or more percent of the teams

304
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,000
out there the gradual change in your in your pace of gradual can be more or

305
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,480
less than mine but it's worked because both on a individual level people

306
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,080
reporting to me on the teams they work on and then on my overall management

307
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,440
team and the weird part is I'm in a separate basically division from the

308
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,650
rest of my peers so we don't overlap that much at all okay so it's

309
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,690
services are for the most part just completely separate from there's part of

310
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,730
my org that overlaps but largely separate so they have begun to see what's

311
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,850
going on over here on on my team over over on my team and begin to adopt some

312
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,440
of those things but I think as far as my peers accepting that was just seeing

313
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,960
me we've been talking about quality culture across the org together I think

314
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,120
they see it from that they get where we want to go what building a quality

315
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,730
culture roadmap has helped me to do we can maybe dive into this in a future

316
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:55,730
episode is it's it's a framework or a model that's worked to get everybody on

317
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:02,290
the same page with what we want quality to do across unity and it's again I

318
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,090
haven't it's a model all models are wrong some are useful but it's helped

319
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,290
to drive even teams outside of mine towards something that looks like modern

320
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,860
testing like you saw a rough you saw an early draft of this yeah this is what

321
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,060
we're working from no and it reflects many or most of the modern testing

322
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,380
principles and moving from the left to the right in the for better for it's

323
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,780
not the right word for the maturity model I built no I know and I think we'll

324
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,300
probably end up talking about it on the podcast because I think it's a good

325
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,220
follow-up like this you know episode seven or the series that we're doing

326
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,100
right now is around what the hell do we mean when we say this right right I think

327
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,660
in the next series of follow-ups will probably be more practical around hey

328
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,340
this is the phase this is what it means like again it's this whole concept is a

329
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:05,060
living yeah yeah breathing thing on it although I will say in advance I think

330
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,380
we better do a mailbag episode 89 to catch up on a lot of questions I agree

331
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,390
then we'll figure out what to do after that but what do you think was there

332
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:24,640
anything so I get your approach I get the strategy but for the listeners like

333
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,570
what is when you if you were to do this all over again knowing what you've

334
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:35,550
learned now because you were kind of also making it up as you went along if

335
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,510
you were to go back and say okay if I were to start this all over again what

336
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,210
would have concretely been your first goal given that you were trying to ease

337
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:52,120
into it I'll have to think for a minute while I talk but my gut reaction is not

338
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,280
much it wasn't as much as that I figured out what I was doing when I went

339
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,600
along of course I always adapt and adjust as I go along what I've done as

340
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,070
I've moved along is tried to document how I'm doing what I'm doing maybe I

341
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,070
would have dove into building that model earlier a lot of it the reason that I was

342
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:17,470
able to spit that out the reason it's been pretty adoptable without a lot of

343
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:24,160
editing by a large part of the team is because it was all in my head first

344
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,720
well so yet so one of the things that I know it explained what was in my head

345
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,600
so I had to sometimes it to dump out what you do intrinsically for people to

346
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,040
understand it and you understand definitely had a vision yes right and

347
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:48,470
over the last year plus I think we've put a put a name to that vision in

348
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,150
combination with what you're doing now as well as my own experiences on this

349
00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:00,350
front right your experience is you slowly loosen the tourniquet right yeah my

350
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:09,850
experience I guess it was it was a band-aid rip right right but in I was able

351
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:17,170
to succeed through it because I had testing experience and several of my IC's

352
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:23,890
had testing experience so like one of the things I think helped me deal with

353
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:30,010
the the band-aid rip is with the fact that I was in charge and I had this

354
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,370
balance experience yes and that would help too so one thing to keep in mind is

355
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,650
and again I go back to the phrase from heffetz disappoint people at a level

356
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,610
they can absorb which is also loosening the tourniquet at a level you can

357
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,930
handle there are parts of my org in fact a big chunk of my org where things were

358
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,730
going fine we had the right leadership in place both from executive leadership

359
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,370
as well from people on the team that knew what they were doing that we did

360
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,640
eliminate the test role so parts of my team we've done that and was the right

361
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,850
time it's worked out very well I'm not and I know which parts of my team that

362
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,010
will happen in next and I know which parts will take a while longer but it's

363
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,290
so my role is a lot about keeping an eye on how much bleeding is coming out

364
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,920
on the tourniquet continually loosening it to keep the metaphor going and

365
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,040
finding out when the right time is to take it off completely so I'm parts

366
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,360
of my team it's just a very gradual experience to make sure we get it

367
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,680
right and parts of my team were there and I've done it and eventually as I

368
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,920
mentioned before on the podcast if I do my job right and we get this far I no

369
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,660
longer have direct reports and I do something different I unity I have a

370
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:45,280
hypothesis here okay and it's it's entirely anecdotal and based on what

371
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,840
I've observed over the last couple of years here at Microsoft and I think it

372
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,840
potentially aligns with what you're saying I do think this push towards a

373
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,440
combined engineering model is unstoppable the unified engineering sorry thank you

374
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:10,440
unified engineering model is unstoppable it will eventually be more common than

375
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,400
not but that means a lot of companies teams are gonna go through transition

376
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:24,840
and my hypothesis presently is when you do that and you have a separated

377
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,160
discipline you're gonna have a different ordering or you're gonna have a set of ICs

378
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,920
on both sides and a set of managers on both sides and the task is how do you

379
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:42,280
intermix this my hypothesis and I will say it is absolutely untested or

380
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:51,680
unproven but my hypothesis is if you form this up and you have a former dev

381
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,770
manager as the manager of the team now you have to take the the the boil the

382
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:04,120
frog approach but if it's the other way around and you put the test manager in

383
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:11,680
charge as long as he's worth his salt and management no I think I think you

384
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:21,540
can rip the bandy I that's my hypothesis I think that could work um the they may

385
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,180
not even be the the test manager I think a leader you need it need a leader with

386
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:32,250
the experience on the team so probably the manager but one of the things I'm

387
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:37,730
doing on all my teams is making sure we have those leaders in place to help

388
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,410
work directly with everyone on the team to make sure they know what to do

389
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,690
because right now we have dev managers in place I think is fine

390
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,600
dev managers in charge which is fine but they need you know this is what I did

391
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,800
this is basically what I did on my last couple teams at Microsoft I was the the

392
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,880
quality guy yep air quote and my job was to make sure that everyone did the

393
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
right types of testing and eventually we did some of that for them through some

394
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,380
vendors but long story so yeah I think your hypothesis is correct you need it

395
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,540
doesn't work if you don't have people on your team who deeply understand testing

396
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:19,000
to help with the transition no yeah for a while for a while you need a deep

397
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,920
specialist to help the team become generalizing specialists and I'm now

398
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,600
thinking through why do I think that when you when you if you do the reorg

399
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,440
model where the former dev manager is the one that's still in charge why do

400
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,520
you need to to ease the frog or boil the frog it's essentially because you're now

401
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:48,360
actually also you not only need to also teach the dev the new development nice

402
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,000
he's or the new unified engineers you know how this quality culture works but

403
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,290
you need to teach that guy or gal what is the measures that now defines success

404
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,570
because in some regards it's gonna it's gonna fly in the face of their

405
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:14,410
experience right a lot of the times is you know how how accurate are your

406
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:21,550
estimates right right but now you're actually making that guy a little bit

407
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,250
more holistic and when I found actually is is test managers moving into that

408
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:34,890
role already get the dev side of it yeah right I believe that's true and that's

409
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:41,480
that's that's the modern tester role right so let me talk about DevOps for a

410
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,240
minute and this again I will I will dive jump it on the outside and send her

411
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,660
back on the world some company did a survey recently that irked me a little

412
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:56,500
bit because they and I have I have semantic buttons that you can push on me

413
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,940
all over the place not as bad as some but bad enough so they're talking about

414
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,180
DevOps and they were surprised in their survey that only 50% of the teams they

415
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:13,850
surveyed had dedicated DevOps teams and I thought what the fudge sickle because to

416
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:20,250
me too high or too low well to me as I learned DevOps and I studied DevOps

417
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:29,030
DevOps is a culture it is but you could have a DevOps team that would help the

418
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,510
team drive towards that culture so what I tweeted a while back which I think is

419
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,990
relevant here they said after reading that I said I'm in the DevOps is a

420
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,390
culture not a roll camp yet I'm only slightly annoyed that there are DevOps

421
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:46,710
roles or teams as those people in teams are there to create a culture of DevOps

422
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,150
on the team eventually the team will have a DevOps culture and not need a

423
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:57,800
DevOps team yeah so I don't correct I don't need elaboration so then I tweeted

424
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,000
again and I replaced one word see if you can tell the difference I'm in the

425
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,040
quality is a culture not a roll camp yet I'm only slightly annoyed that there

426
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,600
are quality roles or teams if those people or teams are there to create a

427
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,960
culture of quality on the team eventually the team will have a quality

428
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:20,730
culture and not need a quality team WTF is the difference you just replaced

429
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:29,340
quality and DevOps but it still makes sense yeah I guess the only problem I

430
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,140
had with what you said is if you had said everything and said the word test

431
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,940
but you're right I don't think you need a quality role either so going back to

432
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:46,800
that survey to me it's I think they were if you take it from a more

433
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,440
respectful point of view and you go okay this company whoever did this they had

434
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,480
some expectation that the majority of companies that had DevOps were in let's

435
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,560
say the first maturity phase of going to a DevOps system right in that first

436
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,600
maturity phase it's brand-new knowledge yeah you need to bring in

437
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,600
specialists you need to bring in experts no I and I can teach the others

438
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,120
yes and a lot of the times that experts gonna be doing the lot 80% of the work

439
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,500
because it's all a bootstrapping effort yeah it's bootstrapping and leadership

440
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,820
absolutely it's bootstrapping and leadership which leads to a question I've

441
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,260
heard about this which is a good question I think with an obvious answer

442
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,100
based on what you just said at least in my opinion I've had people ask me

443
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,860
hey angry weasel they say because that's what they call me a lot of people do

444
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:43,060
yeah a lot of people do so let's say I have a team that gets to a stage where

445
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,220
they don't need a dedicated testing specialist and we go on for a while and

446
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:53,840
there's turnover and the team changes and that knowledge of testing is lost now

447
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:59,640
what do they do well one you retrospect on why that knowledge of quality and

448
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,760
why that knowledge of testing was lost on the team and figure out what what to

449
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,960
fix doesn't just shouldn't just go away but two maybe maybe you do go back and

450
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,650
bring in a consultant to your higher you don't go higher a test team because you

451
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,330
forgot how to test but you can bring in a air quote modern tester role to help

452
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,530
you get back on track right it's same as you'd hire a like oh man our DevOps

453
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:27,640
went to shit sorry sorry I to answer it's got already really you do it

454
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,840
again yes right but but I think you're absolutely right because in that scenario

455
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:40,200
it's hypothetical right because I'm like how would this suddenly how would this

456
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,600
knowledge suddenly just yeah I don't I don't think it was a hypothetical

457
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,480
question right if you do it right in a way you go from a modern tester helping

458
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,880
the team transition if the whole team understands modern testing principles and

459
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,160
we don't do this stuff just for that the modern testing principles aren't

460
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,280
important just for the sake of following principles they help you make better

461
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:11,220
software yeah there is like if you are kicking butt on the principles nobody's

462
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,580
gonna want to go backwards god I want to do so much testing it was more fun when

463
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,930
customers were bitching all the time it's been a while right where I brought

464
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:25,330
up the the monkey's experiment which there's debate as to whether or not

465
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:32,370
it's actual experiment or just a modern a sub s fable but this is the one where

466
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,970
with the monkey's and the latter electric shock and the and yeah yeah yeah right

467
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:49,040
and where essentially there is social pressure to conform so once you have

468
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,160
built up the quality culture and it's and it's achieved this it's tipping

469
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,520
point and it's now part of the subconscious most muscle memory of how

470
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:05,640
your team does business how does that go away well the only way it goes away is

471
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,280
if you get rid of all the people who have learned this muscle memory and

472
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,760
start new or isolation if you have the same people and suddenly isolation comes

473
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,520
into play hopefully that's because of some business imperative that's temporary

474
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,920
but if it's not then you're out and get rid of it again and one thing to be I

475
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,930
want to be clear on is modern testing principles or modern testing as we talk

476
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:41,050
about it isn't a huge leap forward we've been doing agile for a long time pretty

477
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:46,130
good at it few holes then Crispin and Gregory the agile testing books fantastic

478
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,210
talk about them all the time it like okay that's how testing works there they

479
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,490
talk about the whole team quality approach we're just essentially taking our

480
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,330
experiences and what's worked and extending on that even farther and

481
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:05,090
doubling down on the whole team approach yep and raising the value of the

482
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:10,410
importance of data so there was a Twitter feed or a slack channel

483
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:16,730
conversation I forget which at this point in time where people were like yeah

484
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:23,330
this is all all you know pipe dream philosophy so and then the thing is I

485
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:28,650
completely ignore those things because even though from their point of view it's

486
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:34,650
theoretical for me it is long since stopped yes yes no for the thing to

487
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,070
again we're in a little bit of an echo chamber here if you yeah if you're

488
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:43,090
listening to this episode you're nodding your head going yes yes but what has

489
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,250
been interesting to me and I mentioned Caner's book earlier because we walked

490
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,130
into our recording our recording studio and someone had left a copy of Kim

491
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,970
Caner's testing software in the room so it just kind of funny to see where we

492
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:00,270
come from traditional versus modern testing yes but for everyone that's like

493
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:04,730
you know pipe dreams and dumb and you know this is wrecking testing or

494
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,690
ruining the craft the number of people nodding their heads and saying things

495
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,290
like we're already doing that or I had there was one person I mentioned before

496
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:18,690
on the episode where I'm sorry on the episode on the podcast where they showed

497
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:24,450
my talk at test bash and to their dev team and the devs said things like it

498
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:29,670
seems like common sense to me yeah it should it should be common sense we're

499
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,550
trying to just like I did with the culture stuff that you've seen on my

500
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:40,480
team we've tried to take things that we have been talking about in essence

501
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,360
boil them down to principles they've tried it to document what it is we're

502
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,440
saying so you have to listen to you hours and hours of podcasts to kind of

503
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,670
get what is it we believe about where about where quality comes from that is a

504
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:01,310
whole additional philosophy I think it's something we should just go deeper

505
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:08,350
and on that the first thing is in my view if you look look back and think

506
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:14,270
about the summation of the modern testing principles what we see is hey

507
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:23,250
there is a lot of value in this community in terms of its ability to help drive up

508
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:31,020
customer quality and that there is a lot of value in driving up that that

509
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:42,550
customer value to the business we also see number one testing is is on its way

510
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:48,230
out I'll just say no way don't split that way testing is not on its way out

511
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:55,350
no testers testing specialists that that's it is on its way out testing is

512
00:40:55,350 --> 00:41:01,180
still necessary thank you for that correction but the business more

513
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:07,740
benefits at this transitional stage by us sitting with the developers and

514
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:16,700
helping them to own it yeah and then us doing something that's even more

515
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,900
valuable pursuing value versus reducing costs and going all right now how do we

516
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:29,820
take our strengths and our skills around customer advocacy make them real and

517
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,500
focus on what actually makes these customers happy what actually pisses

518
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,820
them off and carve a new role for these folks yeah yeah and to be clear as I

519
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,980
mentioned this person on my team who I said would be the first person to

520
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:52,170
probably not do testing as part of their job I'm not firing them they have

521
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:58,050
they are still a testing specialist they are there if a testing expertise is

522
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,850
needed but they're focused on some of these other things that bring value to

523
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:06,010
the customer and doing some feature work as well there is another thing that I've

524
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:11,290
observed so now I'm gonna have asked you to go back to the days where you

525
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:16,600
still worked at Microsoft you and I survived and there hasn't been another

526
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,760
big hit to test but that's mostly because at Microsoft test is there's still

527
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,470
some pockets but it's mostly gone but in our careers here we went through major

528
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:37,100
several major transitions to the test discipline right sure one you know get

529
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:42,700
rid of the manual testers to there's a several others I'm forgetting but the

530
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:48,740
one pattern in you and I actually talked about this long ago in in the test

531
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,920
architecture group that used to maintain one of the things we observed is that

532
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,530
after a year or so after that transition all the doom and gloom that was

533
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:04,050
predicted didn't happen no it didn't not only that but it caused a lot of

534
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:09,330
sensationalistic tweets from the outside looking in it did but not only that the

535
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:17,040
people who went through that transition personally ended up better fitting more

536
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,720
sure right we saw that they were considered more credible we saw

537
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,920
promotion rates as a community as a whole actually moved right shift that is

538
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,680
correct and in this case it's no different what we're saying but I'm

539
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,640
actually saying is it doesn't make sense to own this anymore that seems to

540
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,000
be the trends if you are a modern tester and you are leading this

541
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,480
particularly if you're in a manager role start working with your guys and

542
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:56,740
easing them into the transition and give them a new place for their career to go

543
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:04,100
and that new place is a more positive one yes and I think like I'm repeating

544
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,460
myself here but if you're worried about your you like I like the principal but

545
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:16,020
all my job to go away I like testing still I would expect none of my team does

546
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:22,220
more than they all do far less than half the testing on the team from that point

547
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,980
it's a sensible transition where they do less and less the only parting wisdom I

548
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:35,660
would say on this particular topic is within Microsoft and I know because it's

549
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:43,720
it's now documented I saw the signs of this occurring around three years before

550
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,510
it actually occurred right because I saw the where the momentum was going I saw

551
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,350
what would be the obvious conclusion and I also saw what the bottleneck was

552
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:59,330
the bottleneck was executives were unsure and they needed someone to show

553
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:05,370
the way and I knew that once that occurred it would be rapid and I had

554
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:09,690
people come back and accuse me of being prescient and I'm like no I

555
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:17,390
wasn't foretelling the future I just analyzed this hindsight 2020 though

556
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:23,830
during that phase I spent a lot of time arguing with people who who held on to

557
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:31,360
white knuckles with their current thing and I realized now that I was pretty

558
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:37,360
much a waste of my time so some people are going to merge into it some people

559
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:43,260
are going to be open and spend your time influencing those but I would recommend

560
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,520
a three strikes your out rule on the folks that are just defending the set

561
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:55,960
as quo you can't save everyone and the ones who don't want to be saved your

562
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:02,960
time is better spent on investing in the ones that yep do one hopefully that's

563
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,200
good one parting comment is we want to do questions next time about modern

564
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,160
testing principles around data around anything you want you want to know about

565
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,840
color my hair is I'll tell you it's the same color it's always been great a few

566
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,160
more gray hairs in there you can either join our slack channel and go to anger

567
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,600
weasel.com wack AB testing and find that or you can just email me at Alan at

568
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,400
angry weasel calm and I will make sure your questions hopefully get answered on

569
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,510
the air yeah all right I'll bet I got the code next time mail for sure we

570
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,750
give that a shot all right I am Alan I'm Brett thanks for listening we'll see you

571
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,110
next time
