1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
It's good to be seen by you.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,520
Our every other week meeting is commencing and we use that time to talk about stuff and

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,620
record a podcast at the same time.

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,620
Yes.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,620
Coffee.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:35,460
So what episode are we Brent?

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,460
62 Alan.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,680
Coming on along.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Awesome.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
Welcome to episode 62 of AB testing.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,320
If you are a new listener, welcome.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,780
That means somebody quit because Brent and I only have three listeners we admit to.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,020
Yes.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,140
For those of you that have, I was just thinking about this the other day, like we talk about

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,460
one of the three all the time and maybe there are listeners that don't know what the hell

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,460
we're talking about.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,520
That's true.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,440
When we first started the podcast, used to joke about our three listeners and then someone

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,320
came up to us and said, hey, I'm one of the three.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,320
So that's awesome.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
And the whole one of the three was boring.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,160
So and that's where one of the three dot slack dot com came from where our three listeners

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
hang out.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Yep.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,840
In their many different personas.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,160
As they rotate through their listenership.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,440
And I want to thank three listeners for all the multiple downloads they do every month.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Yes.

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Hundreds.

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,800
If you're if you know some professional podcasts have have place where you can go and get

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,760
premium content.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,120
I'll do air quotes for premium.

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,240
But if you want to join the community, you know, go to one of the three dot slack dot

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
com.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:03,640
DM either me, Alan, or our honorary admin, Percy on Twitter.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
And we'll hook you up.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,280
Hey, Alan, you know, one of the things that that's currently one of my favorite.

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Items up on the slide channel.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,440
It would be I don't know.

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Okay.

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,750
Is it has to do with kittens?

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,910
No puppies that the kitten channel shut down.

43
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,910
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,870
I've been posting pictures to sad puppies on the Internet.

45
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,470
I'll tell you why later.

46
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,750
What's your favorite thing, Brent?

47
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:39,630
My favorite thing is the spontaneous posting of people's pictures with their new A.B. testing

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,350
sticker on their laptop.

49
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,950
We do have a limited run of one of the three special A.B. testing podcast stickers decorating

50
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,750
laptops now around the world.

51
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,750
Yes.

52
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,460
I probably sent as many off of North America that I have sent in North America.

53
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Maybe a few more inside.

54
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,860
But they've gone to Germany, Israel, UK, probably some other places I forgot.

55
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,460
We're large and worldwide.

56
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
We are.

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,420
I want to.

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,260
Not bad for three listeners.

59
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Not bad.

60
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,260
Not bad.

61
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,820
I'd like to thank anyone, non-native English speaker for struggling through comprehending

62
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Brent and I.

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,820
And sometimes when we get on a rant, I think we are probably one of the more difficult

64
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,020
podcasts to listen to at one and a half speed.

65
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Yeah.

66
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:37,500
From the feedback we get is people will often go back and replay and replay and replay.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,100
When English isn't their first language?

68
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Sure.

69
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Sure.

70
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:51,900
Last time, if you listened, you may remember that we had a great conversation.

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,980
I thought it was one of my favorites, but we never actually got to the mailbag that

72
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
we had planned to.

73
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,100
So we're going to do a whole lot of mailbag today.

74
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:09,350
But first, speaking of scoring on some cool swag, this episode of A.B.

75
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,670
Spacing is brought to you by the folks at Techwell.

76
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,580
And if you know Techwell, you know, they're the folks put on all of the star conferences.

77
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,540
Star West is coming up in October in Anaheim.

78
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,780
They gave me some script here that I always sort of one of the my consistency is in speaking

79
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,940
is I always come back to star and star is a big conference, a good conference for when

80
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,200
you want to get a lot of information, assimilate and have a lot of choices.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,720
But I have had some great experiences there and it seems to get better and better all

82
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,230
the time.

83
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,030
This is me saying it, not a script they gave me.

84
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,350
Star West is coming up in October.

85
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,870
It's October 1st through 6th in Anaheim.

86
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,670
You know who else lives in Anaheim?

87
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,670
Mickey Mouse.

88
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,670
Mickey Mouse.

89
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,670
You are correct.

90
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,670
Yes.

91
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,070
So Brett and I have talked a lot about maybe what could be called agile testing.

92
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,350
But our approach is to testing, which align very much with what's happening in the world

93
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,350
of agile testing and star not coincidentally given they're paying attention to the world,

94
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,400
have 39 sessions on agile testing across the conference.

95
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,560
Like test automation strategies for the agile world.

96
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,120
Where did my testers go?

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,840
Which actually sounds intriguing to me.

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
It does.

99
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
Test management on agile projects, which is also intriguing to me.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,760
Shift left testing.

101
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,880
Now I get the concept, I'm kind of just for the record, FTR.

102
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,020
I am burned out on this phrase shift left.

103
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,000
You want to do right shifts?

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,570
I just think it's like oh I won't.

105
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,570
Yeah.

106
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,570
I won't use the blue.

107
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,570
Let me ask you, would you prefer shift left or lean in?

108
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,170
Because lean in is driving me crazy.

109
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,170
It's okay.

110
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,170
All right.

111
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,170
I'm going to move on.

112
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,090
But the full title is shift left testing going beyond agile.

113
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,860
The point is so much, if you're trying to transition into this world and you just want

114
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,840
to get a bunch of different ideas, and where do good ideas come from, Brent?

115
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,040
Old ideas coming together, making new little idea babies.

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes.

117
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,600
And this is if you are, if you recognize that your world of testing is changing, pretty

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
cool way to get a whole bunch of information, assimilate and make your own plan.

119
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Form your own opinions.

120
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,070
And there's not a formula.

121
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,870
It's going to be, it's context sensitive.

122
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,870
Yeah.

123
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,870
That's the truth.

124
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,430
So you have to pick up these ideas.

125
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,170
Nobody will give you a blueprint.

126
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,480
If they're telling you they're giving you a blueprint, tell them to shut up.

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,520
You need to understand the principles.

128
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,840
You need to understand the philosophy.

129
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,960
You need to connect these new ideas to your context.

130
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Yep.

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,240
And in addition to the variety of testing and QA learning sessions, lots of networking

132
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
events.

133
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
There's the expo, there's speaker one-on-ones where you can get free consulting if you

134
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,600
want it, or free just to chat with someone about a particular problem you have.

135
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,240
And those usually speakers from the conference.

136
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,920
And there's a bonus day session on women who test for women in testing to learn from

137
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,820
and be inspired by each other.

138
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,460
And if you are one of the three listeners and you're interested in checking it out,

139
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:29,480
Star West is offering 10% off your registration with the promo code AB podcast, or, and

140
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,160
I'll put this link in the show notes, the blog post that goes with the download.

141
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,720
You can just go to well.tc, WAC, S-W-A-B testing, and I'll post that.

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,000
Or just go sign up, just use the promo code AB podcast, get 10% off.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
That's multi-reusable.

144
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Take your whole team.

145
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,480
Wait, if you take 10 people, is that 100% off?

146
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
No.

147
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
That's like...

148
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,960
Yeah, so if you take 20 people, the PU.

149
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Maybe.

150
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,480
Take 10 people, get one free at full price.

151
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,840
Anyway, thank you, Techwell, for sponsoring this episode.

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
And please check it out because it's a cool conference.

153
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,880
I will be speaking at a star sometime in the next year.

154
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Wasn't our promo code last time AB testing?

155
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
It was its AB podcast.

156
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,720
Yeah, so for those who have used this in the past, it's the new promo code this time

157
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
around.

158
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
The way I do it right now is I go around the internet and I buy things, because that's

159
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,240
what I do, I guess.

160
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,920
If there's a place for a promo code, I always just put in AB testing to see what happens,

161
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
because you never know.

162
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,260
How many times things have happened?

163
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,780
That's worked exactly zero times so far.

164
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay.

165
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
So Brent, are we ready to roll on?

166
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
We are.

167
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Let's go.

168
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,800
Are we ready to open the mailbag?

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Yes, I am.

170
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,960
Okay.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,640
So we are going to do a mailbag clearinghouse.

172
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I was going to say some answers will be short, but we're not capable of that.

173
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
No.

174
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,850
It is sad.

175
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,050
Our first question is from, oh, and by the way, if you are not a member of one of the

176
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,890
three.slack.com, Brent just laughed because, oh my God, Alan can't non-tangence aside.

177
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,970
We do have our Slack channel, but if you, like at least one of the three, just like,

178
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,050
I don't want to bother with Slack.

179
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,010
I have enough distractions throughout the day.

180
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,250
You can just go to angerweasel.com, whackabtesting, where our podcast is hosted, and there's a

181
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,570
form you can submit that occasionally gets good questions to us.

182
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,490
It also includes a bunch of, of course, all the spam search engine optimization plugins

183
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,610
have send me mail once in a while, but so far the traffic isn't too horrible.

184
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,810
Anyway, there's a form on the website where you can enter a question, and that's where

185
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,030
David entered this question.

186
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,790
David asks, what is your opinion on model-based testing?

187
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:11,670
I know in Visual Studio 2012 included Spec Explorer, a tool we use for model-based testing.

188
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,370
What's sort of going on with that?

189
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,610
I will give my opinion first.

190
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,450
I think I've used model-based testing more than Brent has.

191
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,290
I don't know if that's true.

192
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,690
Maybe not, but I do know that the very last chapter I wrote of How We Test Software at

193
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:34,130
Microsoft was actually my favorite chapter, and one of the chapters that is still relevant

194
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,420
on model-based testing.

195
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,100
Interesting.

196
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,940
I find it interesting.

197
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,580
We've talked about this before.

198
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,140
I find it interesting that in your book, there's still content that you find relevant.

199
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,100
Some of it, yeah.

200
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Okay.

201
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,200
Yeah.

202
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Model-based testing.

203
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,320
My opinion on model-based testing, it's a great testing approach when used in the proper way.

204
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,560
Like most test techniques used in the proper way, it's great.

205
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,020
When you have software that behaves like a finite state machine, and you can automate,

206
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:21,130
it's easy to write the oracle that can verify the state, and the automation that executes

207
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:27,780
the transitions, you can make a pretty good model-based test suite that can basically

208
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,140
a very, very smart monkey that can traverse your application in ways that maybe you

209
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:40,920
didn't think were acceptable, or possible, or usable.

210
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,400
I use Brent, a lot of database background, CRUD operations in a database.

211
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,030
I think you're a good example of where you could apply model-based testing.

212
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,030
Yeah, there's a lot of uses for it.

213
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,590
When I think of this question, I think about ROI.

214
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:05,550
You brought up smart monkey, and that reminded me of a very old deck I did a long time ago

215
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:13,130
around how automation progresses.

216
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,220
I classified model-based testing as a dumb monkey.

217
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:27,060
And the main reason why is it just follows paths.

218
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:37,660
Model-based testing is a great tool when done right and done cheaply, and that is often

219
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
the challenge.

220
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,720
And I'll correct you on what you said, model-based testing is a great tool, but it's really

221
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,640
just an approach, a technique.

222
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,800
What happens is, I want to bring this back to David's question about including Fekk Explorer.

223
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,920
Fekk Explorer, a good tool, a little too complex for some people to figure out for doing model-based

224
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,960
testing or creating models.

225
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,200
Oh, Microsoft, when Microsoft did all the protocol documentation as part of some European

226
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,920
lawsuit and they had to go back and one create specs for these things, then prove

227
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,760
the specs for correct model-based testing protocols are very state-based.

228
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
Great example for that.

229
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,730
What happened, I've seen a lot of people fail in model-based testing, and I've said this

230
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,340
before many times on and off the podcast, is the same way they fail in many other

231
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,860
testing approaches.

232
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,820
Or they want to know what tool do I use to do model-based testing.

233
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,620
They want to start with the tool versus actually understanding what model-based testing

234
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,780
is and whether or not it applies to the thing they're trying to test.

235
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,840
That is a huge mistake.

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,990
Well almost always.

237
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:04,510
The Fekk Explorer, so I've used Fekk Explorer on multiple occasions.

238
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:17,580
The real big challenge with Fekk Explorer is the dependency on a solidified spec.

239
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,340
The theory is fantastic.

240
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:28,460
Hey, if we can write up the spec in a formal modeling language, then we can use that, pump

241
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:38,900
into a model-based exploring tool and use that to drive load on whatever it is that

242
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,540
we're trying to test.

243
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:47,220
Of course the challenge, and I've seen this work on protocols, I've seen it work on services,

244
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,940
I've seen it work on UI.

245
00:14:49,940 --> 00:15:01,840
The real challenge with it is your ROI only comes when there isn't a lot of dynamicism

246
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,220
in how the product actually functions.

247
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:14,300
The other one is it can also be a high cost to build the model in the first place.

248
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,090
The requirement of going back and updating a spec, that was, in my situation, it was

249
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:26,690
a challenge because once PMs, once they write the spec, they don't want to go back and update

250
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,700
it unless there's going to be some further use of that spec.

251
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,860
Let's say it's going to get published as a formal help file or something like that.

252
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:45,240
But a spec can be, you're talking about the Microsoft style, big aspect, where a spec

253
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
can just be a state diagram.

254
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,390
This is how it's going to work.

255
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:57,550
Now if you do that in Spec Explorer, you're not using it to feed your model.

256
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:03,110
You don't need, if you go to GitHub, you'll find many tools to help you with model-based

257
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,590
testing.

258
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,850
But the main thing is, if you're doing it on a small scale, you can do it yourself.

259
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:19,120
For me, back in the day, the thing that I found most helpful about model-based testing

260
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,840
was what I did with my team at that time.

261
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,610
This is one of the times I was in a middle manager role, is we had a need for model-based

262
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:41,070
testing and we used it to drive exploratory testing from an automated fashion.

263
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:46,470
We had a principle back in the day, this is when we still had labs, and we're like,

264
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:53,280
okay, the CPUs in the labs better be doing something at night.

265
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,240
This helped fill that gap.

266
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,000
It was still a bit of a vanity metric.

267
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,080
Once you have a successful MBT, yeah, it will find bugs as long as you teach it the paths.

268
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:16,500
But a lot of the times, the bugs it finds are things that you and I would look at and

269
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,040
say, okay, great, what's the customer impact?

270
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,440
Now with the old-school model where everything was a shipped product, those would be things

271
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
that would be fixed.

272
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,410
In today's world, we'd be like, okay, is it worth fixing?

273
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,310
But the real value was, and it's aligned with the discussion we had with Hans several

274
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:42,490
episodes ago, the real value that I found is when you hook up model-based testing,

275
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:52,880
filling up a suite of atomic methods that your model can call into, that suite, those

276
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,320
set of modules are then relevigable by your static test case suite is what I called it

277
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,400
at the time.

278
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,800
Then once you have that, hooking it up to other algorithms, like my favorite one back

279
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:20,500
in those days was a genetic algorithm, which is a simple data science model where you say,

280
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,420
all right, here's all these actions.

281
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,790
You figure out how to chain them together.

282
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:32,020
I think as for the, and again, we're incapable of short answers, but I think as for some

283
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:38,420
of the fun, the interesting, maybe at least just from an academic point of view, bits

284
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,700
of model-based testing come into play where you can apply a bunch of methods from graph

285
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,420
theory to models.

286
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,280
Shortest path, longest path, most, whatever.

287
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,580
And then if you hook up AI techniques, you can have the model, this is where I start

288
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
calling it a smart monkey.

289
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:07,310
You can have the model not just actively exploring, but actually learning and trying to discover

290
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:14,470
things like an easy one back in the day was, all right, find the shortest path to this

291
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,470
bug.

292
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,190
Once you find a bug, now find the minimum number of steps necessary to reproduce this

293
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,340
bug.

294
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,860
The genetic AI stuff back in those days was just fantastic.

295
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:43,240
And today, I wouldn't go into model-based testing unless I found a cheap way to automate

296
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,560
building the model.

297
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,640
Yeah, honestly, and to close this, we've beat this, but I would add to that or build on

298
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,210
that or throw that away and give me my own idea, which is, I think it's a good technique

299
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,610
to be used in the right place still, but you should understand what it is for you

300
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,870
to dive in. Don't just wave around a model.

301
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,670
I'm going to do model-based testing on this whatever that doesn't.

302
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,110
The maintenance costs for model-based testing can generally be quite high.

303
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:19,140
Yeah, I think even at the sort of unit integration level, you could, again, you can

304
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,420
do lightweight model-based testing.

305
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,140
And if you want to exercise a bunch of states to make sure you have coverage, if you're

306
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,620
worried about the sorts of things that model-based tests might discover.

307
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Yeah.

308
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:36,480
All right, I am going to, I think we have two questions that kind of relate to each

309
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,920
other. So I'm going to set up a twofer.

310
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,860
Go for it.

311
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:48,400
First of all, Heath asks via the submission form on the website, I've listened to a few

312
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,320
of your podcasts and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you are more or less

313
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,960
approaching conversations of testing from the developer point of view than from someone

314
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,380
who purely does testing as their only job, whether functional or automation

315
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:09,490
test. What I'd be wrong in assuming you foresee the testing role as down the road

316
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,290
being mostly phased out and being handled solely by developers.

317
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,500
And my quick answer on that is ish.

318
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:28,400
But I think the main thing is I see that there is a role on a development team for

319
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:36,580
a testing and quality expert who may likely have some coding and some technical skills.

320
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,860
But they are the person who makes sure that just like you may have a database or a

321
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,460
back end or a performance expert on the team, if your product or feature relies on

322
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,460
that, if your product or feature relies on quality, you probably have somebody on the

323
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,360
team who's more or less an expert in those things to help coach the team, write some

324
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,460
of the tests, do some of the things.

325
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:05,040
And whether you call them a developer or not is sort of beside the point.

326
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,640
And then before Brent jumps in and we lose it all, I want to tie that into a question

327
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,680
that Percy asked on the Slack channel, which is almost an extension of that question.

328
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,080
He says, in regards to accelerating the achievement of shippable quality and

329
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,080
statements like this from Josh and four colors on Twitter, where he says,

330
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,860
and Josh is a listener of the podcast.

331
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,580
Hey, Josh.

332
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,740
Sup, Josh?

333
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,780
He says, is the role of the tester simply evolving and expanding its tasks?

334
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,660
Or is it time to introduce a new role to avoid reduced confusion for all involved in IT

335
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,300
who might not see, understand the role of testers going that way?

336
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,980
That's actually the question from Percy.

337
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,940
But in response to Josh's tweet, which says, modern testers should strive to find

338
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,160
valuable work on their teams to help their teams and help the product.

339
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,320
This is a good way forward, which was, I think Josh also watched my keynote

340
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,200
at the tech conference.

341
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
It's interesting.

342
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,150
I'm, it was an evolution and I'm going to start this and then I have no idea what

343
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:10,670
I'm going to say.

344
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,990
So I'm going to let you jump in in a minute.

345
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,470
He just hold those thoughts for a second.

346
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:22,310
I am sort of against making up new words in, in software engineering or new

347
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,010
goals or new, I believe in the specializing generalist and the generalizing

348
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,490
specialist.

349
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,690
Damn Percy.

350
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,770
That is a very good question because there is a lot of baggage that comes with not

351
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,450
just tester, but the, uh, the hundreds of different titles we've given people

352
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,730
in testing in Heath's question.

353
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,890
He mentioned, uh, whether a functional tester or an automation tester.

354
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,350
And the fact that we have functional testers and automation testers and, uh, test

355
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,790
analysts and UI testers and the, and these testers and functional test analyst

356
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:05,050
automation architect does make me think that maybe we've just used up the test

357
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:11,550
titles and, and for a role like Brent and I are advocating and for people like

358
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:18,770
Josh and many others see testing moving toward does that role need a new name?

359
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,690
Will it always be a tester or will tester always have that sort of baggage

360
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,890
and stigmatism with it?

361
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,830
I can jump in now.

362
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,950
Yeah, please go ahead.

363
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,270
All right.

364
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,590
Cause I don't have an answer, but we're going to discuss and see what happens.

365
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,210
So many years ago, one of the most read.

366
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:48,160
I wrote what is now one of the most read, uh, blog posts on, on my site that was

367
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,360
titled test is a four letter word.

368
00:24:52,870 --> 00:25:02,640
And the point of that post was to call out that you get a bunch of people into

369
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:11,660
a room that statement test is the, a four letter word is in fact, the only

370
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,640
thing you will get agreement on.

371
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,400
Yeah.

372
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:27,580
To Percy's question, if the shift to what we're calling modern testing constructs,

373
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,540
uh, more specificity around the role, then yeah, I can do it.

374
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,540
Right.

375
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,700
The, there is a lot of baggage with the word tester.

376
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,740
No one actually knows what it means.

377
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:44,900
Yeah.

378
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,700
You ask five testers what they do.

379
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,060
They'll give you seven different answers.

380
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,680
Right.

381
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:57,100
Um, uh, and as I call out in the blog, if, if I were to tell you, Hey,

382
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:05,340
Alan, I'm going to, uh, code this problem this weekend, do you have some

383
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,440
sense of what I'm going to do?

384
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,740
Really?

385
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,000
If I said I'm going to code this, this solution.

386
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,560
Oh, you said code this problem.

387
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,020
Oh, code the solution.

388
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,540
Okay.

389
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,940
This is maybe a little bit easier to say.

390
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,180
Right.

391
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,460
You're going to, you're going to write some code to do, to solve your problem.

392
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:19,900
Right.

393
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,540
Now, if I said, I'm going to test this solution this weekend, what am I going to

394
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,360
do, uh, any one of a hundred different things, right?

395
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,190
It's, it's, it's an ambiguous term.

396
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:39,730
And for, and I do think that that term itself has caused a lot of the

397
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:47,550
codependency, the anxiety, the, uh, problems, because again, no one really

398
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,810
knows what we're doing and a big part of it is, is test itself.

399
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:56,850
We haven't, uh, to Josh's point, uh, which is our point.

400
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,030
So I'm going to take it back, take credit back.

401
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,990
Um, like the biggest thing is, is that you need to have whatever the role is,

402
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,390
it needs to make very clear what you expect from it.

403
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:15,690
And in a world of, and I've been thinking about this while you've been talking in

404
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:24,450
a world of specializing generals, does it maybe just, maybe Microsoft got it right.

405
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,190
Which is something that's rarely said.

406
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,850
Just give everyone the same title and they are the first person company to do

407
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,270
this, uh, and stop worrying about it.

408
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,850
Were they on the surface?

409
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,090
Cause they did, they did it wrong on so many levels beyond that.

410
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,930
Brent's nodding, even though he works there.

411
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,730
So, so it's review time here.

412
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,970
Oh my God.

413
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,530
And it's that annual time of the year where, where I'm very conscientious

414
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:55,990
of all the things I, I don't, so yeah, I enjoy have lower blood pressure and.

415
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,160
All the joy that comes with that.

416
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,340
But anyway, if it is impossible to have a discussion without a tangent and

417
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,920
a tangent tangent conception, I wonder if going back to Heath's question.

418
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:16,360
Yeah, I think my hunch is the tester rule is fae the tester title is maybe phased

419
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,520
out for a couple of good reasons.

420
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
I don't think testing is phased out.

421
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,320
Testing will still happen.

422
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,720
May happen by different people.

423
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,600
Uh, more testing is happening, uh, by developers and developers are very good

424
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,060
at it better than many testers want to give them credit for, but there is,

425
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,100
we'll always need that quality and testing expert as part of the team.

426
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,700
And furthermore, since I don't care what they're called, uh, coupled with the task,

427
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:53,710
coupled with the fact that the tester title has baggage, I would like to

428
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,610
see the tester title go away.

429
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,170
I think it makes it solves some problems.

430
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,530
So that test is a four letter word.

431
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,130
I completely agree.

432
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,970
I don't know if it needs a new name or we just call everyone just

433
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,890
like I don't call the perf expert perf guru.

434
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,260
I think what we're going to see, and I don't, I don't know.

435
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,660
I don't really have a sense of a timeline, but every year I see more momentum

436
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,940
towards this, this direction than momentum against it.

437
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,320
So I do think, uh, eventually testers are phased out.

438
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,700
I'll just be explicit.

439
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:41,060
In addition to that, in from my own experience, for those who are managers or,

440
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,140
or trying to sort of route their team, like Percy's a manager or I don't

441
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,800
know Heath's role, but in the example here, we'll just presume he's

442
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,480
a individual tester, right?

443
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,280
For those who want to control their own destiny, what I have discovered is,

444
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:07,970
um, if you target that the role you're going into is a developer role, and it's

445
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:13,900
going to be a specializing generalist, that your specialty will be your

446
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,680
testing expertise.

447
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,280
And I fully believe that the path for, there are testers today and

448
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,560
Ollie Blunt as well, since we're on that path, there are testers today

449
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,000
who will just not have jobs in five years.

450
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,520
Just, they don't, it's the role is becoming one that needs a lot more expertise.

451
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,080
I'm going to go back to my, comparing with the, the, the,

452
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,200
a lot of the old value propositions aren't valuable in the future.

453
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,480
Sure.

454
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,920
I'm going to go back to the perfect expert idea.

455
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,760
And you're not going to start off a brand new person.

456
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:44,880
Okay.

457
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,840
You're our perfect expert.

458
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,560
Please ramp up.

459
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,960
No, it takes years of experience to get, to be good at that.

460
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,280
I want to rant a little bit again about how often I see posts on Twitter

461
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,280
and on forums of testers who want to get into test automation.

462
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,520
And then once again, I'll say that is not your path forward.

463
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,400
If you are good at accelerating the achievement of shippable quality via

464
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,080
providing value to our team, technical contributions, getting in and digging

465
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,920
deep as needed, those are the things you want to be good at.

466
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,880
Those are the things that will make you the quality and testing expert

467
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,800
for your team.

468
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,400
That's going to find you a job long, long, long, long time into the future,

469
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,840
because that's what kinds of roles will be available to the people who

470
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,200
are good testers today.

471
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,840
Maybe, maybe.

472
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,320
Right.

473
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,360
Cause the other thing too, you got to pay attention to is the tooling

474
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,200
coming up in the open source community where there's a lot of,

475
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,840
there's a lot of companies that have pure developers.

476
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,520
They, they, um, don't hire test or pure testers.

477
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,520
But they have these testing problems and they're working through how,

478
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,280
how do we automate these things such that we don't have to hire these guys?

479
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,340
Yeah, perhaps.

480
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:16,380
But I would say that the testers that have been paying attention and doing

481
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,700
testing things for several years, they have gone through a lot of the

482
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,900
failure points that these teams are again, using the open source tools,

483
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,900
all the glue is there, but they don't know, they don't know what the tip,

484
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,460
what the traps are, what, what, what things to try and do, what things

485
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,260
to try and avoid experience tester can again, accelerate the team

486
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,940
by identifying those.

487
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,210
I guess, I guess the point I'm saying is, is, and we, we talked

488
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:52,450
about it in here right now, the current shiny role, uh, in software

489
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,610
is the data scientist.

490
00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:02,980
And, you know, I can easily see a path where 80% of the problems that I work

491
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:08,740
on, on a, on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, uh, readily automatable

492
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,300
in the, within the next 10 years.

493
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,260
And then if we connect the dots between the testing role and how, how you

494
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,940
and I have been talking about leveraging telemetry, when you add that to what

495
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,230
I'm predicting for the data science role, like when you, when you have an

496
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:33,550
agile software development team and you have a backend decision-making

497
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,630
framework that kind of 80% of the time accurately tells you what to do

498
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,710
to improve the quality of your software.

499
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,180
That's going to be good enough for a lot of companies.

500
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,980
I think so.

501
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,180
I think there's agreement, but a difference in approach and point of view on this.

502
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,660
I think the coach, let me clarify, let me clarify.

503
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,180
I think the coach role is going to be, it certainly is critical right now in the

504
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,660
phase we have right now, as, as these companies are going through these

505
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:07,540
transitions, um, people who go into this role, I think they're going to have

506
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:13,540
a lot of meaty work in the next five years for sure, but they can't sit on

507
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,820
their laurels.

508
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:22,820
They have to, they have to continually figure out, all right, what do I need

509
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,100
to be learning now that's going to be valuable when my current role isn't?

510
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,500
Yeah.

511
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:33,220
And I like, you actually, uh, got where I was going, bringing up that coach role.

512
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,620
Yep.

513
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:39,540
I don't know if you paid attention, but there are a zillion, I counted, uh,

514
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,010
agile coaches out there, people coaching agile.

515
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:43,410
Yes.

516
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,090
Agile, there's a lot of tools out there.

517
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,050
There's a lot of books, great books.

518
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,930
You could learn it on your own yet.

519
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,610
There are a zillion agile coaches.

520
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,170
You know what else there is out there?

521
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:56,610
There's the, and it's two zillion openings for agile coaches.

522
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,290
Really?

523
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:58,690
Yeah.

524
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,540
So interesting, maybe a zillion, maybe a zillion and a half.

525
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:11,420
So I could see a place down the road where the quality coach, maybe it'll

526
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,260
just be called an agile coach, but, but there is perhaps a path there.

527
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,420
Uh, a parallel path.

528
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,980
I'll call it a parallel path for coaching and testing as teams begin to get good at

529
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,180
that.

530
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,660
A lot of teams don't have agile coaches because they've had one before.

531
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,300
They figured it out.

532
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,260
They're rolling along great.

533
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,860
I think it's part of that transition.

534
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,740
Many teams may need, they're aligned, but 30 coach, different specialties,

535
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,260
absolutely different specialties.

536
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,140
I'm just saying that, that even though agile has been around for a while and many

537
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,900
teams do get it, there are still a whole lot of agile coaches and teams looking for

538
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,740
agile coaches.

539
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,620
Uh, that makes me think that five, 10 years down the road when, uh, the

540
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,860
quality testing role is something that's coached into a team versus a separate

541
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,980
independent team to do it.

542
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,500
There may be a parallel there.

543
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,460
I need to look that up because as an agile coach, I'm just thinking through

544
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,500
like, what are these people looking for it such that they would hire on a full

545
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,650
time agile coach, because right now in the roles that I've been doing, that wouldn't

546
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,290
make sense.

547
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,240
Then to address perzies question, if, if I may, if you go, oh, please, Brent,

548
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,630
is it time to do a new role?

549
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,240
Maybe, but I do think that that new role is an interim role.

550
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,580
Cause I do.

551
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:40,500
Uh, and again, from my experience, what I find is if you, if you push these guys to

552
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:47,480
be the next generation developer, you're going to have a much more successful

553
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,640
development process.

554
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,000
That's the direction that I would go.

555
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:57,090
It's harder to learn how to be a talented tester than it is to be a talented

556
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,650
developer.

557
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,010
Sorry, Dev.

558
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,130
That's my opinion.

559
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,440
I'm sticking with it and I have a concrete experience that proves it.

560
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,460
Finding the O of one sort algorithm is not hard in today's world.

561
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,500
It's a Google search.

562
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,820
Finding what makes customers happy.

563
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,940
That's hard.

564
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,740
And, um, a Google search isn't going to give you that context today.

565
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,620
So I think it's going to close out both of these, my opinion.

566
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,860
I'll give you the final word.

567
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,820
My opinion is yeah, it's phased out.

568
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,980
There, there may be some value in creating an interim role.

569
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,500
I have no idea what we would call it.

570
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:50,000
Uh, and given that I like Alan's idea of, uh, you know what, screw this.

571
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,080
Let's just call it engineer.

572
00:37:54,550 --> 00:38:01,230
And, and stop associating unexpected and an

573
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,630
ambiguous value with a group of people.

574
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,180
All right.

575
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,220
And, and I want to address Heath's question directly where it says, uh, the

576
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,060
part says, it sounds like you are more or less approaching conversations of

577
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,900
testing from the developer point of view.

578
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,060
Uh, not directly.

579
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,260
That's where testing, we're talking about what Brent and I are

580
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,460
calling modern testing where testing is evolving.

581
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:24,900
Yeah.

582
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,860
Where the tester is part of the development team and their

583
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,700
responsibility isn't to test everything that Dev team writes.

584
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,140
It's to accelerate the achievement of the shippable quality.

585
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,580
I will say that, that I don't view me approaching this problem from either

586
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,940
a Dev or a tester point of view.

587
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm approaching this from a business leader point of view saying, if, if

588
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:59,420
my job is to make a better product, make customers happier, I don't care

589
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,580
about the current distinction between a developer and tester.

590
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,980
I think that's the important part.

591
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,260
I need software developed.

592
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:12,500
I need it to, to, uh, solve customer problems to the point where those

593
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,100
customers pay me to solve more of their problems with software development.

594
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,340
Yeah.

595
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,980
And that's the point that we'll use track of in these, uh, in many of these

596
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,220
discussions and sometimes philosophy wars around the need for test is the

597
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,620
goal isn't to justify your job as a tester.

598
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,460
The goal isn't to find bugs.

599
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,020
The goal isn't to, uh, test quality into the product.

600
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:39,410
The goal is to get software to your customers that they love and they love

601
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,490
enough that you, they want you to make more of it.

602
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,640
Yeah.

603
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,020
And if you can be in a role that accelerates that process and makes

604
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,220
that process more efficient by that's, that's what you do.

605
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,820
I don't give a crap what you call it from a pure economic point of

606
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,780
view or a pure business point of view.

607
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:05,540
The decisions made there are entirely apathetic to any individual's, uh,

608
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,380
loyalty to a discipline.

609
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,020
All right.

610
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,580
Right.

611
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,020
So I like how you always keep say I can have the last word, but then you

612
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,780
keep on adding onto what I say.

613
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,500
So we're going to move on to the next question.

614
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,860
Now, it feels bad.

615
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,220
Ha.

616
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:19,860
Okay.

617
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:26,530
Uh, one last question for the day and we probably won't finish it, but

618
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,770
so we'll leave some loose ends.

619
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,410
We'll finish it.

620
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,050
Okay.

621
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:29,730
Uh,

622
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:35,860
from Derek who is one of the three, uh, Hey, Derek, uh, you mentioned

623
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,740
in episode 60, very good episode.

624
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,700
Go back, listen to it.

625
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,820
Uh, that the maturity model a tester should follow is collect

626
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,380
inform, recommend, and act.

627
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,970
The example given was related to analytics and seeing as something

628
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,930
was being used and if actually had metrics to measure, if not, then

629
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,530
recommend that get implemented and so on.

630
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,850
I have a few questions.

631
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,390
And Brent, you may want to editorialize on, on collect and form, recommend

632
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,630
act later, but, uh, questions are, I have found that sometimes the role

633
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,710
of product manager and tester can sometimes overlap.

634
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,670
Yes.

635
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:16,230
I apologize if I misunderstood, but then is using that model.

636
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,110
You mentioned an example of this.

637
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,270
Where specifically is that line drawn between product manager and tester

638
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,510
as a tester?

639
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,990
Am I using this model as a baseline to evaluate the product overall and,

640
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,510
or when I discover a bug?

641
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,470
So I'm going to go first and then, because you're a model, you can talk about

642
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,430
it more, uh, and give more examples.

643
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:40,270
But, uh, what I've found in, and I'll relate it back to the last question,

644
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,590
this role of modern testing and where teams are going, there are very few

645
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,270
hard lines, in fact, uh, my team's no hard lines.

646
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,030
Every line is blurred and overlapped.

647
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,410
That's kind of how generalizing specialists and specialized

648
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,730
and generalists work for my team.

649
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:56,970
Yep.

650
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,770
So I don't worry too much.

651
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:04,090
I have testers who definitely and explicitly play a product owner role,

652
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,370
product manager role, because there's nobody doing it.

653
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,970
So they fill in a little bit on that side to make sure that that chunk

654
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:10,690
of work is getting done.

655
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,370
And that's okay.

656
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,490
Some do development work.

657
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,410
Some do data science work, other work.

658
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,730
That, and there are no hard lines.

659
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,530
Although I do as a manager, my job is to make sure I'm not stepping

660
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,850
in any toes and the right overlap is happening.

661
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,490
There are, there are, there's work to be done.

662
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,920
There are skills necessary to get that work done.

663
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,240
And there are people who have those skills.

664
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,760
So, uh, I'm going to paraphrase Derek's question, which it really says,

665
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,450
dear Brent, would you please talk some more about the model of collect

666
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:50,770
inform, recommend, and act and in doing so remove some of the ambiguity

667
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,650
I've discovered while I've been thinking about it.

668
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,450
So when I saw this question, I had intended to do some deep thinking

669
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:02,850
on it, uh, and did you write a, no, and write a blog post on it.

670
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,370
And I still intend to do that.

671
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,090
And maybe I'll do that over this weekend.

672
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,660
I'm off to wazoo to register my son, uh, for college.

673
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,380
Wow.

674
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,620
And it's interesting.

675
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,540
I wish I could do that.

676
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,100
My oldest is 13, so I can't quite do that yet.

677
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,940
So he has to be there for three days for, for registration.

678
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,460
And so, so do the parents.

679
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:33,500
That is, that is purely an exercise done by the university to generate income for

680
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,300
the town of Pullman, Washington.

681
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,580
I have no doubt.

682
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,180
I'm like, why do you need, you know, and they require the parent.

683
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,980
I'm like, why do you need three days?

684
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,500
I would just send them off and say, just tell them you're an orphan.

685
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,740
Yeah.

686
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,860
I feel like I'm going to be going there and, and being meetings about the

687
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,220
new wazoo timeshare.

688
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,860
Um, oh yeah, they probably want you to buy a timeshare for your kid to live in for

689
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,580
his, uh, six years there.

690
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:03,980
Right.

691
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,620
All right.

692
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:12,580
So first and foremost, uh, I would not say that I have formalized, uh,

693
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,360
CIRA as a test maturity model.

694
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:23,880
And just to clarify, KSTM is that CIRA is not the alternative to Siri on the iPhone.

695
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,080
CIRA is the collect inform recommend act.

696
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,560
Right.

697
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,600
What I, if you, if you go back and listen to that episode, what I, it is a data

698
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:39,080
science maturity model that, um, I believe can map to the modern testing

699
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:47,930
model, right now, there is an overlap between PM and tests in this world.

700
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,770
One of the things that I actually didn't like about our, our example, when

701
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,290
we talk about recommend, Hey, let's recommend adding telemetry.

702
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:59,710
Yeah, whatever.

703
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:06,750
I mean, um, it kind of reminds me of code reviews, uh, where inevitably whenever

704
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:11,750
you do a team code review, you have the one guy who all he's doing is looking

705
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,330
for hard coded constants or hard coded strings instead of constants, right?

706
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,850
It, what we want to be able to do.

707
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,920
So the, the whole collect inform recommend action model is

708
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,560
intended to be goal driven.

709
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:36,700
So a you as a tester, you need to look at your techniques and your skill sets,

710
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,940
the specialty that makes you valuable to that organization.

711
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,460
Think about the business ROI.

712
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,000
And then in this maturity model, right?

713
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:55,430
Figure out what you need to do to collect data, connect the dots between the, as

714
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:01,310
we talked about earlier, collecting the dots between your talents, what the

715
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:07,710
business needs and what the maturity model is, what we're saying on the

716
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:14,270
modern testing world, uh, in particular, we're saying just informing people.

717
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,740
That's a, that's, that's over.

718
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,620
Like move on.

719
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,360
But now what we have to do is figure out our techniques with our techniques.

720
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,160
How do we then bolster it and say, this is the recommendation.

721
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
Now I have worked with multiple PMS.

722
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,920
Okay.

723
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,660
They are not in general good with working through data.

724
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:47,060
What they are good with is coming up with ideas, um, socializing with

725
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,660
the customer, um, getting in, receiving feedback with that customer.

726
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,330
Um, and I think they're going to continue and sort of persist in that role.

727
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,990
In terms of recommendation, I would say that the, that the tester role needs

728
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,960
to be a bit more tactical in this.

729
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,720
Whereas the PM role is going to be a little bit more strategic.

730
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,500
I'll let me try to be a little bit more concrete.

731
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,180
Like one of the, one of the act, uh, things that, uh, we're doing here in

732
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:26,390
Azure is we're trying to improve deployment cycles.

733
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:27,190
Okay.

734
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:31,390
And with there's this mantra that we have is safe deployment.

735
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:37,790
Now the more you make a, uh, so what a deployment is, is, is essentially a

736
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:43,450
new code package being, um, rolled out into production.

737
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,120
So what makes it safe?

738
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,940
Well, safe means, um, bugs have minimize impact, right?

739
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,660
So there's a quality aspect to it.

740
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,660
But the other act, the other aspect to it is, um, you can make things safe.

741
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,340
You know, add three months of big time that'll make things safe.

742
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:10,500
So it's how do we balance the, the, the quality aspect of it while

743
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,180
tightening up the cycle time.

744
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:22,080
That is a very concrete problem that a lot of, uh, companies have today that

745
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,800
I think aligns well with, with the testers, uh, skill set.

746
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,240
If tests can then make a recommendation around, Hey, these are the types of

747
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,000
things that we should proactively test.

748
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,160
These are the type of monitors that we should put into our ring zero deployment.

749
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,240
And these are the ones that we should continue to monitor as it goes out to

750
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:55,660
production with the idea of, um, making a recommendation of either reverting or

751
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,860
moving the deployment forward.

752
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,740
That is something that I think is very strongly something that the

753
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,660
test has talent in doing.

754
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:11,900
So, uh, I'm going to jump backward to the last question in a, in a tangential

755
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,620
comment, but as I've heard you mentioned, and I agree with everything on the

756
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,700
tester is good for this because testers, the good ones are traditionally

757
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,660
systems thinkers, they're good, critical thinkers.

758
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,540
They see the whole picture.

759
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,420
They're good at gathering data and making decisions or they should be, if

760
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,540
you want to be successful in the future.

761
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:31,770
But, uh, I don't know why this didn't pop up in my head earlier, but I had a

762
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,330
little revelation, a little light bulb went off.

763
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:37,130
You don't know if you saw it or not, but, uh, maybe we do change.

764
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,290
We do come up with a new role, a new name.

765
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,330
And cause I heard you say tester tester tester.

766
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,010
It's not right.

767
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:43,610
It's not right.

768
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,010
But in the sense of accelerating the achievement of shippable quality,

769
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:53,980
what if we called the new role, the software accelerator brand doesn't like it,

770
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,300
but I'm going to throw it out there.

771
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,860
And I'll tell you that, I mean, I, I like, I like the way you're going.

772
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,860
The thing I don't like maybe quality accelerator QA.

773
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,300
Who?

774
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,180
No, that's not good.

775
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,940
The, the, the,

776
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,500
we could just repurpose the acronym.

777
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,700
Like last year and call it quality assistance.

778
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,820
And they're very excited that they assist developers.

779
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,500
The issue I see with, with the software accelerator quality accelerator.

780
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:19,940
It's QA.

781
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,940
The, well, what you initially said is the idea of, if I saw that title,

782
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,940
like I would expect these guys to be like on the engineering systems team.

783
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,540
Right.

784
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,300
Working on build or things like that.

785
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,580
One of the things.

786
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,100
But wouldn't that role also be accelerating the achievement of

787
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,020
book quality by making builds faster?

788
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:42,860
Yeah.

789
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,180
As long as it was well, and actually that, that, that, that, that,

790
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,500
um, springboards into what I wanted to say around the recommendation.

791
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,580
I apologize to Derek for the tangent, but it's expected.

792
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:55,980
All right.

793
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:56,420
All right.

794
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,020
Pop the stack back.

795
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,380
What you're going to say about, uh, informing and acting.

796
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,180
Well, so on recommendation.

797
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,060
Right.

798
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,620
Easy recommendations like, Hey, let's add telemetry.

799
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:16,870
Like anyone can do that, but the hard ones are around what is the risk.

800
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:23,230
If we take an approach to tighten cycle time on a deployment, say to two hours,

801
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,380
deploy it in the wild, how do we mitigate that risk and how do we measure it?

802
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,460
Now.

803
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,740
That measurement aspect.

804
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,780
That's something that I think is, it would is best suited to be measured in

805
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:43,860
terms of customer impact, um, which then kind of brings it into, uh, the QA realm.

806
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:50,380
But the problem with that is you kind of time trying to simultaneously

807
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,620
optimize two variables.

808
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:59,140
We want the highest quality and the safest deployment and striking the

809
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,620
balance often is a subjective call.

810
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,060
And what I'm saying in this case, I think it's something that QA is well suited

811
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,300
to do with their knowledge base.

812
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:09,900
I agree.

813
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,980
Now driving it to action.

814
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,140
Right.

815
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,820
So the first step is recommendation.

816
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,780
And this is where you put together manual reports.

817
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,420
You visualize the problem and you, you make it very clear to others why

818
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,260
your recommendation is viable.

819
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,980
The recommendation is a data-driven decision because you've

820
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,900
collected before then.

821
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,260
And once you've gone through some period of time in terms of, uh, people

822
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:42,260
establishing trust that your recommendation is fantastic, then it's

823
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,980
just the action part of it is generally just automated.

824
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,610
Now there can be a lot of complexity, right?

825
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:57,150
Um, uh, and I don't want to, the thing is I, so what got me into data

826
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,080
science, um, is I never cared about testing.

827
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,620
I've always cared about quality.

828
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,500
Quality is fascinating to me.

829
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,000
And, and I found that data science allows me to deliver that.

830
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,700
Now the, the basic testing skillsets, uh, around, uh, around data is

831
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:25,580
probably not going to be sufficient, but any sort of data science 101 course

832
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:31,150
is going to introduce you to 80% of the basic techniques.

833
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:31,950
Of course.

834
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,950
And, uh, there's a lot of value in just those techniques.

835
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:41,150
I want to, you said something a minute ago, you didn't pause for dramatic

836
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,030
effect on enough, which I think is really important, which is you don't

837
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,870
care about testing, you care about quality.

838
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:46,230
Right.

839
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,310
And Whitaker did that talk several years ago.

840
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,790
I think it was all this testing is getting in the way of quality.

841
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:55,510
And when I think about the really good testers, I know, uh, they're

842
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:59,190
driven by quality much more than testing.

843
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,890
Well, and it's just, it's something we talked about.

844
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,730
Like we don't care about the activity.

845
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,810
We care about the goal.

846
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,410
Yeah.

847
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:12,290
And that's, that's an important thing for, I think all three listeners to reflect

848
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,570
on and reflect on with your teams is remember that the goal is quality.

849
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,850
The goal is to make software that your customers love.

850
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:24,770
It isn't to run a million tests or get 99% code coverage or whatever.

851
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,210
You want to make software people love.

852
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,050
And that's the goal.

853
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:32,250
It isn't, isn't like, Oh, well I did exploratory testing and I found six bugs

854
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,530
that customers never care about.

855
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:42,010
You want to make software people love and use and do it before your competitor does.

856
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:42,890
Yeah.

857
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:43,770
Right.

858
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:51,770
So there is the quality and time cheap, fast, good, um, pick two is what

859
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:55,130
every MBA one-on-one class will teach you.

860
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,680
What we need is good and fast.

861
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,520
And what agile does is it helps to optimize the expense.

862
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:04,920
Yeah.

863
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,400
Like I like how Reese calls the point of a startup.

864
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,720
It's to come up with a viable business plan before the money runs out.

865
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,520
Yeah.

866
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,520
I forget the, the remember the name of one of the blog posts.

867
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,640
So maybe just a few months ago, I did a two blog posts within a couple

868
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,320
of days of each other, one called the fallacy of now, like, Oh, we got to

869
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,320
do it now, no matter what.

870
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,480
And one kind of called failure to launch, which is trying to get things

871
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,600
perfect before you get them out and losing the market opportunity.

872
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:39,800
And I think, uh, uh, that balance is, uh, very difficult and again, one

873
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,560
that can be very data driven and, uh, and a risk can be assessed and

874
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,800
measured by people in the QA role.

875
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,600
And it's, and it is far from a black and white world, right?

876
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,880
A lot of the times as an agile coach, when I go talk to teams are like,

877
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,960
but we can't do that.

878
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,080
And when you decompose it, it's essentially they can't do that because

879
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,800
they haven't learned about continuous integration and their current build

880
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,800
system or their current architecture.

881
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,440
Doesn't support it.

882
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,440
But then I said, okay, great.

883
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,560
So you may not be able to do it now, but you can do it and you can start.

884
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:18,640
Right.

885
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,680
It's just code.

886
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,880
It's not magic.

887
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,600
Everything is baby steps.

888
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,400
None of this happens in big chunks.

889
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,720
Everything is small steps.

890
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,720
All right.

891
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,280
So, you know what I think we've done.

892
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,320
I think we cleaned out the mailbag.

893
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,850
Mailbag episode number three.

894
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,450
I don't know.

895
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:36,890
Complete.

896
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,650
Uh, thank you for the questions.

897
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:44,370
Uh, it's, I always learn a lot just from talking through these things.

898
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,050
So, uh, please keep them coming in.

899
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:51,010
And, uh, we have, uh, plenty more topics, non mail bag to talk about, but

900
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:56,010
we'll, we'll try and fit them in a little bit more consistently in the future.

901
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:56,490
Maybe.

902
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:57,960
No, we won't.

903
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,520
Okay.

904
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:58,960
Brent.

905
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,880
I was trying to be all like, uh, we're improving and

906
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,680
reds going, no, we're not.

907
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,040
We're done.

908
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,440
No, the, the ADHD aspect of our thing is part of our charm.

909
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,800
ADHD testing.

910
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,400
All right.

911
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,160
Okay.

912
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,000
I'm still Alan and I'm Brent and we'll see you next time.
