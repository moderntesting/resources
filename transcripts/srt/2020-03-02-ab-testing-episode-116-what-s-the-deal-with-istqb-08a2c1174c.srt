00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
What's the deal with I Stq B?

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,350
Welcome to a B testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,810
Will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

4
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:28,090
Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we are back again for another episode of a B testing. I don't know what number it is

5
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,090
That's Brent stuff

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,490
116 that's what's that number in binary?

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,960
It's

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Frantically counting on his fingers. Hey Ben

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
What's new pussycat Wow?

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,890
Have you ever been to Scottsdale, Arizona? Oh, that's right. You went to Scottsdale, Arizona

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,530
I've never been there because I'm not although I'm older chronologically. I am NOT that old. I

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,010
Understand the comment you are attempting to make know the comment was made

13
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,860
I

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,740
Yeah, I went there yes, the short answer is no, but that was that was more boring than the proper answer

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,020
Go ahead. I am you went to Scottsdale. I

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,990
Did you golf I did not so?

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,120
Did you sit outside? Oh my god?

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,790
about the heat oh

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
This is gonna be a fun adventure today

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,900
So never been to Arizona

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,060
Or

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,040
Scottsdale anyway, I realized after the trip that I had in fact been at Arizona before

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,340
My as a as a young kid Ling we used to do trips to Lake Havasu

24
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,320
Which has the London Bridge at the songs all about?

25
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,790
So I've seen that but I do I do recall it moved there. Yep

26
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,630
Have still have not seen the Grand Canyon

27
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,230
Anyway, what I did see

28
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:04,190
You know you know on every cartoon ever when they talk about the desert they show the the typical

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,030
Cactus with the arms yep to the side

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,170
That's first time I've seen those in real life and I was surprised by how

31
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,270
Gigantic they are they're like tree size wait wait how big are they?

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,310
They are so big

33
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,770
That they're tall they are that trombone sound effect like two to three

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,000
at least two times up to three times the size of a

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,360
Standard adult human it was kind of cool

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
It was neat that that

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,800
They didn't have light pollution at night, so you got to see the stars

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,040
Their night times were the same temperature as the Seattle daytime. Oh

39
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,320
So like 40 degrees yeah, I mean cuz it's the desert so it it just back and forth

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,040
We didn't go out exploring

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,440
The this was just a 3d weekend

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,320
And part of the point was just hanging out by the pool and drink

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,650
That part I like yes, we did

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,220
Unfortunately, we brought the kids with us all of them are just the two youngest the ones that still live with us. Yeah

45
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,100
We didn't even tell them our oldest until I send them a picture from the in and out and in Scottsdale

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
He's like what are you doing in California?

47
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,510
So he might be a little angry at us because it's the first time we've ever done a trip and not even ask if you wanted

48
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,840
to go

49
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
But it was it was good time

50
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,660
my we are now in the

51
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,900
moment of the year

52
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,620
And because it's sleepier

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,330
Which is tomorrow

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,450
Not for the podcast listeners, but for you and me leap day is tomorrow leap day. Yeah. Yes

55
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,010
Day is tomorrow. So

56
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,290
every four years ish

57
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,070
My wife is

58
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,470
Exactly two weeks older than me. She just celebrated her birthday Wednesday

59
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,750
So two weeks from last Wednesday

60
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,830
it will be mine and

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,430
I am

62
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:35,420
Officially moving a step closer to a RP. Oh, I've been a member for years

63
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:45,510
Yeah, it's I was talking with one of my employees yesterday and it there's this psychological

64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,100
Thing that happens when you work in the software industry where the majority of people are 20 something 30 something's

65
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,100
And so you walk around you see everyone in their

66
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,770
30s and

67
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,880
You just you it's very easy to forget that you are not

68
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,450
Yes. Yes, I

69
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,930
Went down to the Bay Area yesterday for a set of meetings

70
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,590
We should talk about DevOps sometime. I don't know why this because it's so close to testing and I

71
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,950
It's so close to I think actually I think I've mentioned on the podcast that it is

72
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:35,350
The best tool I've ever had to accelerate the achievement of a quality that that's I was down there talking about DevOps

73
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:43,660
In California twice on my mind. I think actually I mean we could we should talk about it because I have a hypothesis that

74
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,220
DevOps is is

75
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
in essence a

76
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,110
Service oriented actual

77
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,430
implementation of true

78
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,350
agile

79
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:05,510
Yes, I mean but just like everything else in agile. There are fantastic ways just completely effort up

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,400
Absolutely true as well one quick little bit. I'll just we'll get back on the topic of the day

81
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,200
I promise but I find it interesting

82
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,320
You know DevOps was never meant to be a role meant to be a culture that got rid of throwing things over the wall

83
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,200
not from Deb the test but from Deb to

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,040
Operations and the idea of a DevOps culture meant that the full team anyone on the team could deploy or

85
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,780
Whatever culture where it's easy for anyone to safely deploy rollback, etcetera their stuff

86
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Which helps fulfill several of the agile principles?

87
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,660
The DevOps role has grown out of that for some reasons that some of us used to fight now

88
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,460
We just throw our hands up near say yeah, we I think we get what you mean as long as you do it, right?

89
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,780
But what I'm finding as I have an open DevOps position on my team is that

90
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,410
As I look at resumes of people who say they do DevOps it is

91
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,810
Just as wide if not wider than the resumes of people that say they do testing

92
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,570
Wait, why do you have a DevOps position on your team?

93
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,980
Your team I run you're hiring

94
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Okay, so are you hiring?

95
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,450
Because I'm confused

96
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,480
I work at Unity. No, I understand just just didn't know I just making sure that how much alcohol you drank anyway

97
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,740
Well, so to me it seems like you're hiring an SRE role

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,800
because as you

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,960
Stated DevOps is a cold it is it is really in the okay. Let me be clear

100
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,400
Do you want to know where DevOps go 10 years ago? I would have been hiring for a

101
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,500
Infrastructure person a platform person a tools person

102
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,250
Okay today the fancy sexy things to call those roles DevOps. Oh

103
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:01,810
I did not realize that I hate that with great intensity. So the team I the team I ran at

104
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,250
Microsoft my last team basically was a DevOps team

105
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,440
Airquote that the listeners can't see DevOps is what you call people that build all the tools and

106
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,780
Processes and things that allow you to quickly and easily ship stuff to customers. Okay, so can can we start?

107
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,020
Trying to rename this one. We can't DevOps

108
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,560
Infrastructure to can't we can't the ship has sailed we can only ride on the ship. Oh my god

109
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,140
Okay

110
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,900
so

111
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,780
Let's talk about the thing that's been working through the modern DevOps principles

112
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:48,760
Alright, let's go and actually we've talked about we'll never get there because there are I think from Jez humble

113
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,640
Don't quote me the three ways of DevOps

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,680
Which are three things that I don't have memorized right now, but I remember reading them thinking

115
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,120
Oh, these are aligning very very very very well with the modern testing principles

116
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,750
So let's talk about the I

117
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:13,990
STQB vision on the future of software testing because it's been flown around a lot

118
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,750
We're gonna go through it in a little bit of detail and talk about our opinions

119
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,190
There is one line in it that I'm sure we'll get to

120
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,910
That one line out of the whole thing and not that the whole thing is like super awesome or anything except for the one line

121
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,790
but the one line that has triggered

122
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,060
Absolutely triggered a large handful of people from the test community

123
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,300
So we'll go over that and some of the repercussions have come out of that as well

124
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,740
So so let's go ahead. Well, you have a point. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. So I don't know if this is the line that you're talking about

125
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,780
No, not that I'm very curious as to what ideas

126
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
You contributed to this paper

127
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
Okay, you want to get right there? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I

128
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Think it's easier to

129
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,100
Get into that later. So my okay, that's fine. I will tell you right now. No, no, no, no

130
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,500
We you brought it up. We can't leave it go now if you go to the acknowledgments

131
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,740
We could have held it as a cliffhanger. No, you screwed everything up again

132
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,580
So we go to the acknowledgments and the team thanks the following leaders who were interviewed and gave ideas for this white paper in alphabetical order

133
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,080
blah blah blah Alan Page I

134
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,380
I'm not saying I didn't talk to them, but I don't remember talking to them. I don't know

135
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,020
What the interview was I I feel like maybe a couple years ago or a year and a half ago

136
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
I could have talked to someone

137
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,300
But I don't know what I said, I don't have a transcript or notes I can't find anything on my calendar

138
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,180
I'm not do you think this paper?

139
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:59,950
Was under development for a couple of years. It may have been I don't remember it certainly I certainly haven't talked to anyone

140
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,470
Recently at the very end again. I'm old and I do acknowledge that and I do acknowledge that I drink a lot

141
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:15,110
But I do not remember by it's maybe it's a different talent. It's weird. I have this vague

142
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,390
Like I have this vague recollection of

143
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:27,070
Someone asking me to talk to them, but I do something like guest podcasts that it could be one of those that I did

144
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,830
there's enough of a

145
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,750
vague recollection I could have talked to someone and I do

146
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,610
I

147
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,250
Get contacted for whatever reasons for a lot for just

148
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,040
Research interviews and things for various publications

149
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,520
I don't recall this one, but I do enough of these things that I may have said something to him all that said I don't

150
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
recognize I

151
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,120
Mean other than the obvious things that we're going to agree with in this paper that we're gonna go through in a minute

152
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,680
I don't really recall any specific things. I may have said or even if I actually talked to these folks

153
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:16,200
So that's my and we should let me come back to that because that my name being in this has caused

154
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
more than one

155
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,810
More than one alter not an altercation is wrong

156
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,890
a

157
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,370
Conversation on the internet because my name's in this paper

158
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,850
So let's go ahead you want do you want to start with something or do you want me to start?

159
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,570
How do I go through this so you can start?

160
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:43,550
This is a very short paper and I'm probably gonna forget to link to it in the show notes, but just search for the

161
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,750
Istqb vision on the feature of software testing if you're and again

162
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,770
I usually put a sentence about the show on the website and if I remember a link

163
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,250
I'll put it there, but I realized that 99% of you just listen to this thing

164
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,940
What's the end the 9% of three?

165
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,900
Rounded down the two so two of you rounds up to three two of you

166
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,260
Whatever want to do two of you probably just play this in your podcast player and never go to the website

167
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
But there's a link anyway

168
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,180
the first paragraph is all about

169
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,900
Trying to establish the credibility of Istqb

170
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:27,370
So I'm gonna skip that one and then they say the out the statement that then this is not controversial

171
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:34,370
Software testing is a complex topic. I'm gonna skip that but one thing in paragraph two will start with is

172
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,370
True and I could have said this I could have contributed to this

173
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,110
Significant change in the software. I didn't say this nevermind

174
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:49,450
Significant change in the software doesn't discipline is on the horizon and testing has become a quality assurance driver engaging other professions and professionals

175
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,770
Not just software testers. I'm not even sure why I underline that anymore except for the fact that

176
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,290
All of this has been true for years as far as I'm concerned

177
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,810
I don't know what's futuristic there

178
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:07,610
But I do think change is coming in the discipline in that it's in everything we've been talking about in modern testing

179
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,020
Yeah, no, that's why modern testing exists. We want to talk about the changes happening to how software testing is performed

180
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,700
well, so a lot of people's favorite episode of

181
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,740
Of a retesting every no everyone's I

182
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,700
This point in time. There's a lot of people who haven't even gone back to that episode

183
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,770
everyone oh sure

184
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,050
Where we did the where you dropped the is TQP

185
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,760
Quiz or questionnaire or test on me. Yes, and you failed I did fail

186
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,590
Suck it

187
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:56,150
So I think like captures us on this one is is the statement that significant change in the software testing discipline is on the horizon

188
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,750
Now that's something that we very much agree with

189
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,780
now the question is

190
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,990
Do we agree with what that change is?

191
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,030
Right there's surely in that some second part of that sentence

192
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,890
Make honestly, I'm having a hard time

193
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:27,050
Decomposing it and testing has become a quality assurance driver engaging other professions and professionals

194
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,970
Not just software testers now one way to interpret that could be the quality coach

195
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,200
Maybe but the one thing I don't like about this is it doesn't go it

196
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,720
I thought it maybe mentioned coaching and what spot it could be

197
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,920
misremembering ever read this in a week or two, but

198
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,880
it still

199
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,760
Views testing as a distinct and separate discipline and not an activity of software development, which is I think not the future

200
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,640
But anyway, go on. Yep. No, no, I'm I'm good. You want to talk about the next paragraph?

201
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,520
I don't even know. Okay, there's nothing there. I feel like I could write a

202
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,840
One paragraph version of this whole paper. There's a lot of there's a lot of stuff saying testing is hard

203
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,120
We worked hard to figure out the testing is hard

204
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Yes in the future it gets harder

205
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,960
Technology blah blah blah. I think you may be over simple. I mean, yes, it does seem like a

206
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
lawyer in test wrote this

207
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,320
Right because of the the language that they're using

208
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,600
That's lit

209
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Software lawyer and test. Yeah

210
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,730
Like on the vision the vision that they talk about

211
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:47,960
First and foremost, I don't know why they've done this but I do I do think

212
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,850
That in their vision they are potentially playing it's safe

213
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:03,570
Because they keep referring to this term called testing technology solutions. Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. That just mean tools

214
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,370
No, I took it to mean tools is that wrong? No, I'm pretty certain they mean AI. Oh

215
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,090
Well, we all know AI is gonna change everything or not

216
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,990
Yes, so surely it's talking about future. They mentioned AI in this video if you go to

217
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,070
So here if later on in the document

218
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,060
They have a section called the clarifying section for the vision of software testing and

219
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,400
and

220
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,820
They describe testing technology solutions as follows the testing technology solutions will have quote

221
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,520
intelligence in quote built into them

222
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,160
Yeah, there are several trends including AI which will address effectiveness and accuracy of of

223
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,580
Testing other systems and can be used to develop innovative testing technology solutions

224
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
over time these

225
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,920
Testing technology solutions will evolve into

226
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,600
Learning teaching engines they will learn from testing experts, but we'll also learn from other

227
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,630
testing technology solutions and from themselves as

228
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:24,250
software development or development evolves these testing technology solutions may be integrated into software development technologies, okay

229
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,830
All right, I get it. So that describes

230
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,310
AI and the process of building and

231
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:41,750
Training AI so one thing before I get into the controversial statement one thing I don't like about this paper is

232
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
complete lack of specificity

233
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,540
So it's very broad stroke ish things are gonna change and it'll get different

234
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,860
Oh, so no, that's fine

235
00:18:52,860 --> 00:19:00,120
Maybe that's the thing that where they picked up from you right because it's this is following our prediction episode paradigm

236
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,480
If you just say things hand wavy

237
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,500
Yeah, I if it's I'm not happy with the writing it so beyond that

238
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,980
Let's dig into this. There's one thing in this clarifying vision

239
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,420
Which in the paragraph above the one you read which let's go ahead and get into now before I go on because

240
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,300
It's this is the one that has triggered people lots of stories to go on here

241
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,420
Software testing is moving towards more automation. No, it's not so

242
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,060
Okay, that one has that's not the future that's been true for the past

243
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,580
Gazillion years. No, it's not though because they're mutually exclusive. Okay, let me get on to that

244
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,420
Because I assume that's going to go off so it says but then it says the part which is

245
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,690
I I get what they're saying

246
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,830
I don't agree with it

247
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,730
but not to the vehemant degree as some of the people that have

248
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:07,930
Stocked me on LinkedIn have over time a software testing will become fully automated and embedded in the processes and technology

249
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,930
It's in the overall software development cycle

250
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,760
Now you can make your voice cuz software testing can't be fully automated you can automate checking but testing requires

251
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,680
Exploration and investigation and the computer can do that

252
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,810
Actually it can

253
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,490
So what computers can't do is

254
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
Well, actually and that's not even true

255
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,740
I was about to say they can't do inductive reasoning

256
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,990
But that's not actually true either

257
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,950
So I have written and I put this in Twitter and I'm gonna work backward is that I've written plenty of tests that do

258
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,310
Investigation and helped me explore the application

259
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,830
there is

260
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,830
so what happened was

261
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,830
more than once I've been tagged on LinkedIn because my name's not acknowledgement section and

262
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,310
Someone who has not read the whole paper but just that line has decided to go off on

263
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,150
the fact that

264
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,280
She only checking can be automated which is bull and only testing can be done by a human and this

265
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:30,080
complete and utter gatekeeping on this concept that yes, some tests have a binary result and some tests don't but

266
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
the

267
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,330
insistence on

268
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,250
having people use the right language and an inability to infer from context and an

269
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:49,410
Inability to see past your private little vocabulary that only exists within a microcosm of the software development world

270
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,410
Just is not helping your cause. It's not making you look good every time

271
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,570
And this is I know that there are listeners who are in that who believe in context-driven school

272
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,730
I think context-driven is fine

273
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:07,450
It's some of the dogma that's coming out of the the people that have developed that which has caused problems in the industry

274
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,450
And I'm fine because those people

275
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,250
Deal with people brand new to test don't know what they're doing. They're not

276
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:20,970
Air-quote technical they've been thrown in to test things and they've been shoved at a conference and there are people in the industry who make

277
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,170
Their livings on testers that have don't know what they're doing and are shoved under a mushroom and don't know

278
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,700
blah

279
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,300
Why a mushroom?

280
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,560
Because there's there's some mushroom thing. They're in the dark and crapped on it. Oh got it. All right

281
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,280
So look I get it I get it I get that you

282
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,400
Follow two people in all of software and they believe and you believe that only they have the right answers for everything and you must

283
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
regurgitate everything they say

284
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,360
versus thinking for yourself, but for Christ sakes

285
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:02,340
You need to think a little bit wider if you're going to be a successful knowledge worker in the 21st century

286
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,860
So anyway stepping off of that rant on to another one

287
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,600
I got tagged as like them post because you need I want answers Alan

288
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
I want answers for this statement

289
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,540
Someone said that to you not in those words

290
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,520
But they went through and they found the they started with just a couple of us who were tagged in there

291
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,620
It's easier to find but I think they went through it eventually tagged everyone they could find from that

292
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:31,220
Acknowledgments list looking for answers on why they thought why we all thought testing could be fully automated

293
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,840
Well now you have a podcast to send them to

294
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,520
That to me

295
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:49,000
That does does the amount of heat that you're getting are you suffering deja vu?

296
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,080
You know, it's the same. Yeah, I mean

297
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,490
It's not deja vu. It's

298
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,650
recursive to me it feels

299
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,760
We have a different version of to me. It feels a little bit like a

300
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,400
Different version of the white knuckle

301
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,830
Holding on to the past that we experienced

302
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,950
when you and I

303
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
essentially came out and said

304
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,680
Not only is testing going away at Microsoft

305
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,600
We agree with it. No the testing role is going right not the testing. Yeah. Yeah, and and people I tell people

306
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,960
Alan you've been in testing a long time

307
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,080
I said I've dissolved the last like I have a bad habit of dissolving all the test teams

308
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,000
I work on because it's the right thing to do right so this I think is

309
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,040
What they're stating here the is TQP is essentially

310
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
one way to interpret it is

311
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,040
The final mail to the coffin is

312
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,150
Coming. I don't think it's worded in such a way. I don't think it reads that way

313
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,670
I think you could read software testing will become fully

314
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,330
automated

315
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,330
right that means

316
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,800
number one if you're in testing the robots are coming to take my job and

317
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and

318
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,680
It means it's not going to dev

319
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Going to the computers, right?

320
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,490
People would argue and you and I work almost entirely on back-end services API's

321
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,490
Very little that the customer sees there are a lot of people

322
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:41,490
testing the things the customers look at the UI's the interfaces the interactions the workflows who

323
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,350
Insists that that must be tested manually. They must use their

324
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,290
fantastic

325
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,610
investigational exploratory skills that work at the speed of the human brain

326
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,930
To test those things in order to protect the customer from bugs

327
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,330
What do you say to those people that's easy?

328
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,370
companies who who

329
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,130
Have test leadership

330
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,910
That gets influenced and buy into that philosophy

331
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:17,790
Will be destroyed. Yeah there and those people are deeply embedded in job preservation as well

332
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,430
They're not you and I and you know, you've seen me do this every role

333
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,510
I'm in I try and work myself out of a job for better or for worse

334
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:32,870
But there's this opposite effect among many of these people where they want to dig their heels in and make sure their job exists forever

335
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,830
Why do we automate?

336
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,550
Because we're bored. No, we automate

337
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,910
We automate because we're trying to scale engineering

338
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,670
Time that to engineering hours. Okay AI. What is AI?

339
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,750
artificial intelligence good job

340
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,750
AI

341
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:03,210
In essence is automated decision-making. Yes, that is what AI is very well put

342
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,640
So yes currently a lot of a lot of the software automated testing

343
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,880
I would say a bulk of it is

344
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,070
Checking right. Hey, I expect this to pass. I expect this to fail

345
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,550
We know

346
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,550
Hell I know I've implemented the you've already admitted to implementing

347
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,590
Exploratory absolutely as possible sure and with AI

348
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
You can make

349
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,800
Exploratory much more intelligent. Well, if you think about let's go and wait and then you combine that with product telemetry

350
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
When we're in the service space

351
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Sorry

352
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,000
If you one big thing in services and applications now is growing is observability

353
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,440
not just the logging and monitoring being able to know the state of

354
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,760
What's going on in your application at any time and full observability?

355
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,500
Now if you start adding AI into observability AI is great at pattern matching

356
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:14,440
It can start to recognize when if it's connected with the with the internal structures of the software

357
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,960
It can actually I could

358
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,670
We could create AI to do just-in-time

359
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,750
Diagnostics and recognize when a current state is one hasn't seen before

360
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,950
like my soft your software system has reached a state that

361
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:37,200
The AI has determined it shouldn't be in that's not theoretical. I know no, no, no

362
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,480
I've actually written this in my I've written this in my head a little excited. No, no

363
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,960
So yes, I know it's not theoretical it's possible and likely happening I

364
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,820
can

365
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,860
Date it is happening

366
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,860
So the main point is I think a lot of the folks who are freaking out over that

367
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,840
There's other stuff I want to get to which is equally as controversial this it's really cool

368
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,340
There's two statements that should trigger the crowds that I'm speaking about this one especially

369
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,780
But there's another one another section. I'll get to in a moment

370
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,020
But yes, I think people are blocked

371
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,620
They aren't thinking big enough

372
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:26,120
They aren't looking at a big enough picture and they don't realize that some of these things are more

373
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,300
Possible than they think they are because they get stuck in their vocabulary and their dogma

374
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,720
Yes

375
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Yes, and

376
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,840
I love it when we have episodes where I get to rant and I'm not even done yet. Oh

377
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Yeah

378
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Now it's interesting

379
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Because I didn't know where we were gonna go me neither about this thing

380
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,620
So I don't know what your next statement is but there's one thing I want to bring up. Yeah, you all yours

381
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,160
I need to I need to lower my pressure. I'm gonna check the stress level on my on my smartwatch

382
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,040
so the I would love to

383
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,100
Be able to conclude that is TQB is actually seeing the same things we are

384
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,640
Now what I think is interesting is what what they are proposing

385
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,540
Might be different and we should get into that

386
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,380
But here's a statement that I think is

387
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,520
Just so friggin important

388
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,450
I'll read the whole paragraph

389
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,820
The perception of quality of software systems continues to change

390
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,450
okay, and

391
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,120
We've talked about this a million times

392
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,050
the the

393
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,370
1986 definition of quality is bugs and

394
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,530
That is bullshit in today's world

395
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,110
Get over that is not that it is

396
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,300
customer of the business that drives that that perception

397
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,140
Continuing on is affected by factors in the marketplace

398
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,420
economics technology culture

399
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,900
software technological innovation and

400
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,880
globalization the business

401
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
the business

402
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,880
drives the

403
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,720
interpretation of this perception of quality

404
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,990
No, only the gatekeepers of quality could tell the person. Oh damn it

405
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,940
Go on so we that one future of testing

406
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,350
White paper we talked about a couple years ago

407
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,730
One of the things they called out is

408
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,650
that

409
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,290
business leaders

410
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,290
really felt

411
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,620
testing

412
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,900
Need to step up and understand how the business drives its business

413
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,090
Okay, there is another section in here where they call out

414
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:12,890
QA needs to shift to decision-making roles. Yes, and I cannot you actually finish that I want to get into that next right I

415
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,450
Completely agree. I wish this whole idea of

416
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,450
We just provide information to the stakeholders. So let me go ahead and get into that

417
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,090
Because there is a big and I can name drop here

418
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:33,330
so Michael Bolton over and over and over again and then through the the blind followers

419
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,490
I'll call them blind followers because they don't look outside of that that echo chamber

420
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,410
Insists that

421
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,770
Testers get out of the quality assurance business because I think

422
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,390
labeling yourself as purely an information provider is

423
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,390
a

424
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,030
very passive rule and not an active role in software development and

425
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:03,580
Probably more importantly I I don't see a career path there. I don't see I mean, there's no growth there

426
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,940
What do you do provide better deeper more information? I

427
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,220
Don't know why someone would want to be part of a software development team and they weren't actively participating in delivering that software

428
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,500
Here's my reports do it whether you want not my choice. I can't make decisions above my pay grade, which is crap

429
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:27,540
It falls into the same group who in fact these guys do it too. This happens a lot in just in general

430
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:33,420
People like to blame the pointy haired managers. Oh, we can't do proper testing because our managers won't let us well

431
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,820
My manager at Microsoft in my first day gave me a list of test cases and told me to

432
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,660
Run them every day and we didn't have time to automate them and I had them automated three days later because they were crap

433
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,100
But anyway, let me go on to this section, which is at the end of the clarification section

434
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
I think my papers a little out of order by now

435
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,780
responsibilities of testing professionals

436
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,380
blah blah blah

437
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,620
Accelerate the incorporation of evolving text methodologies and tools in the testing technology solutions

438
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,340
Okay, get rid of the get rid of the testing technology called technology solutions. That's DevOps. That's what we do

439
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,100
That's what that's what DevOps does or or even modern testing

440
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:17,420
We accept we we make sure we're using the best tools we can for testing for deployment for delivery

441
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,140
For static analysis code analysis CI CD. We make sure we have the best tools we can use either

442
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,060
bot

443
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,620
OSS built ourselves to make sure we can deliver as quickly and safely as possible

444
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,340
Well, but here's the thing because remember testing technology solutions that the AI one is

445
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:42,980
Essentially, I think it's I think they talk about AI indirectly, but I think they're talking about methodologies

446
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,180
They talk about it directly. I just read it. I know but they don't even use the word AI. They don't talk about it directly

447
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,860
They do they did

448
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:55,040
Where the hell is it? I don't know. So another one is again

449
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:02,680
This is I think a direct jab at the information provider community when they say which is why I'm so surprised that

450
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,940
Get out of the quality service business hasn't come up because people are so obsessed with you can't automate everything statement

451
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,880
But they say in this paper be a major

452
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,960
Decision maker and major not a decision maker not providing information not giving your opinion

453
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,080
Be a major decision maker in the risk assessment and quality readiness of software solutions

454
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Holy crap. Yes

455
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,320
Don't be an information provider. Listen to me

456
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:39,240
Stop being an information provider you have the information. I don't understand people don't want to be a decision maker it it drives me

457
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:46,560
Bonkers that that you think that's above your pay grade for some reason get involved the people in this role in the future

458
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,860
Have to understand the business. Yes, they are

459
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,540
already

460
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,940
experts around

461
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,380
Risk assessment and quality readiness. Yes. Okay

462
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,840
what the ask is here is do the analysis and

463
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,160
bridge between what the business cares about and

464
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,320
What your data shows I think it's important to bring up because I think

465
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,360
Some people will say well, it's not my choice to choose whether we ship or don't

466
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,900
That's a business decision and your priority is improving the business and you need to be

467
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:34,580
expert my job as someone who's been in and out of testing for 25 years is to help

468
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:42,220
Entire organization balance velocity and quality. Sometimes I slow them down. Sometimes I try and speed them up. It's a balance

469
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,260
blah blah blah

470
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,180
Embrace new ways of software development and production

471
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,540
so yes

472
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,900
Follows modern testing principles use improvement. Let's find new ways to do things better theory of constraints, etc

473
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:01,380
And ensure comprehensive risk assessment and quality readiness, which yes doesn't mean you do it

474
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Elsewhere in this section they talk about the need for software testers to provide leadership and move in leadership positions and modern testing is a lot

475
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,820
About leading teams towards better ways of making quality software. So hells to the yeah

476
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,600
So I think there are despite the fact that I'll let you on a minute here

477
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,380
the

478
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,020
Community has focused on the one line is pissed him off

479
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,860
And I think if a lot of people were to dig deeper

480
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:34,140
they would find several more lines that would piss them off and I encourage them to do so and

481
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:40,060
Enter the conversation because I think they're actually entered the conversation

482
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,980
Thoughtfully as if your career may depend on it. Yeah, it's just it's just

483
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,500
There's gonna be a long tail. Yeah, we've if this falls back to them talking about modern testing

484
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,540
Yes, stuff is changing if you fail to recognize that if you dig your heels in I

485
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Have no guarantees about your future employment opportunities. All right, you're going to say so

486
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,450
The number two that you talked about apply common sense and ethics effectively into the learning cycles

487
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,990
I skipped that one you can talk about it. All right with the testing technology solutions

488
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,630
Right. So I'm going to one of the the page

489
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,510
Titled clarification section the ethical aspects of decision-making

490
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,390
by artificial intelligence

491
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:37,630
Hopefully will be resolved and this requires a level of human intervention in the testing technology

492
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,950
solutions where ethical judgment is concerned

493
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,670
okay, so when

494
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,600
they are

495
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,560
Absolutely saying that the testing technologies

496
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,000
60 plus percent of the core of the definition of that is AI and

497
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
they're viewing

498
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:05,530
Tester's role is going to be a judge of ethics. I

499
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,030
Think that role needs to be there. I think there needs to be a human

500
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,730
That's judging that

501
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,060
I

502
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:21,500
Don't know that testing. I don't know that I agree that testing professionals are going to be the experts in that space

503
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,110
Well, I don't know either. Yeah, I mean you look at me. I'm not very ethical

504
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:37,280
You're being snarky I think you are well, yeah, I mean you're not a you're not a rule follower. I'll say that

505
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,890
But the human condition is absolutely

506
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,650
Something you're concerned with

507
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:50,840
But I don't see it as testing professionals to do that. I actually

508
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,040
Because right now the typical testing professional doesn't understand how these things are built

509
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,640
so

510
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,990
one of the things and I think there's a

511
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:07,030
interesting cap we can put on this conversation is I think in order to

512
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,470
You have to get out of the echo chamber. You have to look at opposing views

513
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,910
I I do this politically I do this with testing to the software

514
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:20,070
I look at people that hate TDD people that disagree with modern testing principles try and figure out where they're coming from

515
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:26,910
It's always a motivation there. Sometimes it's job self-preservation. Sometimes it's something else if I look at the motivation of is TQB

516
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,870
Although there are some things we agree with some things we may not agree with some things

517
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:37,310
We don't I don't like the way the paper is written, but that's beside the point. I can say for certainty

518
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,190
You know is TQB is in the business

519
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,230
Of selling training and certifications

520
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,870
So if the testing role were to go away completely

521
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,590
They'd be out of business

522
00:40:54,110 --> 00:41:01,750
So I have to wonder a little bit around the motivation and again predicting things is hard, especially about the future

523
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:06,390
So if they see these changes happening, they never see the testing role going away

524
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,950
In fact, the first paragraph talks about the changes in the testing discipline. I

525
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,120
Wonder what they think this means for them and their business

526
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,080
What are the what do you think these statements if this future plays out what changes in Istq be?

527
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:30,520
So in that light, let's let's now decompose a section called clarifying responsibilities of testing professionals

528
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Okay now first off

529
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,840
This could in fact be an objective report

530
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,680
Funded by Istq be right. Maybe they haven't

531
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,130
Published a document that is useful to identify

532
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,940
Istq be's response to this feature. Maybe they just did a

533
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,980
study and

534
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,980
Wrote it up in an objective fashion

535
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:10,800
But this says testing professionals shall need to embrace the new methodologies and technologies around software development and testing

536
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
with the intent to

537
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:19,460
Integrate these faster into their testing technology solutions. Okay, that is something that we've been stating

538
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:26,040
right the role is to accelerate the achievable a shiftable quality and

539
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:37,350
The testing professionals they need to shift and stop bottlenecking and instead accelerate the shipping. Okay

540
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,530
Well that first statement

541
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,490
Could Istq be?

542
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,050
Do a further study and adjust their certifications around that probably

543
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:53,340
Right these new methodologies and technologies a big portion of that's gonna be agile

544
00:42:53,340 --> 00:43:00,140
Could they move and they do an agile certificate at like a agile certified tester or something something like that

545
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
but would their

546
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
Curriculum move to cover

547
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:14,640
Learning new technologies or leadership as they like I think it will have to absolutely and what would make their leader

548
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,960
I guess would be they could I could see Istq be this is pure speculation that we're endorsing this by any means

549
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,920
But I could see them in the next couple years coming up with a test coach certification

550
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:33,430
Sure, sure. I think that would make a lot of sense. Maybe you just solve their problem for them. That's what I'm here for

551
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:39,870
I'll take and they'll probably talk to me about it and I'll forget talking to them and I'll forget I'll also forget to collect my fee

552
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,470
Darn it. The testing professionals shall be required to pick up the pace of

553
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,720
Bringing greater testing capabilities to the software. Hell. Yeah, right? Nothing wrong with that

554
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:57,400
The try and argue with that one. I'm waiting. We should do a sentence by sentence debate on this over the internet

555
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,480
Anyway, go on in working on behalf of the users

556
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,480
Testing professionals will be required to learn how to teach

557
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,220
the testing technology solutions to

558
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,440
Continually improve the quality of software solutions and development. There's the coaching

559
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,220
No, but they're teaching the testing technology solutions

560
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:27,960
Yeah, I don't think I think I think AI is included in there. I don't think it always means AI I it primarily means AI

561
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,520
Alright, well agree to disagree and here's what they're saying

562
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,210
They're saying testing

563
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,070
professionals

564
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,890
Move to what's done in data science as an expert

565
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:51,110
and contribute their knowledge into an AI that becomes their responsibility to

566
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:55,190
train up better ais for testing and

567
00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:01,570
They may even be saying that there is a portion of data science that they're expecting that these folks

568
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,970
Learning capture. I wish again. I wish this paper wasn't written in so much code

569
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,480
Me too, but if you were is TQB

570
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,570
It and you would probably want to do it this way to couch a

571
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,060
Little bit of the hate that's gonna come to you

572
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:27,300
Right. We already know because we did it with modern testing, but I think we're much smaller than I see QB

573
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,000
We're definitely much smaller reach when they sent this out

574
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:39,450
But you know you got to give him credit but this whole they got people talking about this paper this whole last paragraph I

575
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,320
mean, it's

576
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:48,680
Long worded. It's only three sentences and it essentially says the testing professional

577
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,840
Job will be to automate themselves out of that job by training up the testing technology solutions

578
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:04,840
Testing professionals walk to ensure the testing technology solutions incorporated self educating lessons and learned capabilities

579
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:12,000
Which provide continuous improvements? They're talking about a learning system. I dig it

580
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,360
I dig it so and can can they build a new certification around that? Yes

581
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:25,520
What happens when those testing professionals succeed carp launch across the domain where where I see QB has a reach

582
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:33,830
I see QB has to come up with a new version of this because it's over again

583
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,360
feature of any feature of testing doc or

584
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,680
Presentation or whatever it's going to be wrong. I've given a couple of these in the past. I've given feature testing talks

585
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,920
They were way wrong. It's really what's the

586
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:51,570
This one's actually more futuristic, but a lot of it we see is happening now

587
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:57,860
Well, and the thing that was brilliant of what they did. They didn't put a timeline. No, of course not

588
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,360
But they got people talking and I'm disappointed and I mentioned this

589
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,840
There is so much in here to tear apart and to talk about and discuss

590
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,660
Anytime you have an essay like this, it's not about

591
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,900
It's not an experience report where you can say well that didn't work for me or whatever

592
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,380
This is speculation

593
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,200
to

594
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,520
Inspire discussion and it has inspired discussion, but I'm disappointed in the overall testing community that

595
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,040
the

596
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,520
Debate has been around the one line around automating everything. I think

597
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:41,610
Failure to recognize the context of which that line is stated and failure to recognize the other highly debatable points and discussion points in the document

598
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:46,010
Is a failure in I don't know what I call it critical thinking or system thinking

599
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:52,010
It's a failure in thinking and looking outside the box and there's a I'm sure there's a fallacy around this where you get

600
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,650
It's like the moth to the light

601
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:00,770
Fallacy, here's the most controversial statement. Let's focus on this instead of finding the other points to debate as well

602
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:06,150
Whether you agree or don't agree and there's or like or don't like this paper

603
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:12,670
I think there's value for anyone it's not just testing not just testing in software development

604
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,430
To think about which of these statements may or may not seem

605
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:22,430
Applicable or valid and have a discussion around that the thing I

606
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,990
command is TQB with this paper is

607
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,710
In my humble opinion

608
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,260
There's no way to interpret it

609
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,220
other than

610
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,420
testing

611
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:48,460
professionals are at risk and I commend

612
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,180
Istqb making this a paper

613
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,020
That tries to explain it

614
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:01,260
Because they know if they were to just say if they were just to say the Istqb version of test is dead

615
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,740
No one's gonna hear but that's a defense for many. I mean, that's the objection

616
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,140
For many to this paper. They say purely

617
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,700
Testing is not going away

618
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,660
Therefore this paper and its statements are invalid

619
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,700
and again because I actually think

620
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:27,470
Istqb has a great deal of infrastructure and a great deal

621
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,150
to gain

622
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,590
by not publishing this paper

623
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:38,820
True right. I think this paper is pointing out a direction that is

624
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:46,060
Contrary to how Istqb has built up its current that is interesting. Yeah, you're right. Why would they?

625
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,620
Because like I said goes back to their business choices

626
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:55,580
Interesting and it's in my view. It's because the trends that we and others have been seen

627
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,180
Are now obvious to Istqb as well and also and maybe

628
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,780
Interesting to point out before we close here is that Istqb publishes paper

629
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,140
I've seen I haven't looked for it, but I haven't seen them

630
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,560
Discussing or defending this paper a lot. They've kind of let it just sit in the community and let the conversation

631
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,260
Let it they're letting a thousand flowers bloom, which I don't know if that's actually true or not

632
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:25,820
But it's interesting to see that all of the discussion is from the people disagreeing with the paper and there aren't I

633
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,400
Haven't seen anyone from Istqb talking about why or what or anything

634
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,860
No, but that's just the the noisy few it is that are

635
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,780
Right now being defensive after all this discussion

636
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,000
I would like to say I still don't remember if or when I talked to them or what I said

637
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,900
So but some of the but I can see now how some of the things

638
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,020
Could have been inspired by what I said. So there's that

639
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,000
All right

640
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,440
Thanks for our book report. Thanks for listening to our book report on the Istqb vision of software testing

641
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,360
I am almost an hour later still Alan and I am NOT. All right later
