1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,250
Hey everybody, howdy.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,090
I'm Alan.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,910
I'm Brent.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,310
And we're here for another episode of A.B. testing.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,070
What number are we, Brent?

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,630
I believe we're 73.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,030
I believe you are correct.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,870
Yeah.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,550
We made it to 73, it's been a long time coming

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,470
and this is our last show of 2017, right?

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,510
It is.

12
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,940
Next time we talk to you, it'll be a whole new year.

13
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,700
Happy holidays everyone, happy new year.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,420
All of those things, yeah.

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,940
How you been?

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,780
I'm tired.

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,620
I just, tired, I just got back from not just,

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,180
I was in Moscow last week.

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,180
Yeah, you know what, some of the questions

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,180
that you were sending me, made me a little concerned.

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,580
I'm like, huh, Alan needs to make it home.

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,480
We got the end of the year episode to do.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,140
I had a lot of time in between talks

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,260
and at nights and things.

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,940
I was doing a bunch of work and I had some questions like,

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,220
hey, how can I do this thing?

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,120
What would you, mainly just kind of Brent

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,660
as a sounding board?

29
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,220
Oh, those weren't the ones that bothered me.

30
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,220
What were the questions that I asked you?

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,310
The ones that gave me an idea that you may choose

32
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,350
to be extra dramatic on your presentation.

33
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,910
You know, one of the things though,

34
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,750
so I saw your deck.

35
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,950
I'm always dramatic in my presentations.

36
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,910
I saw your deck.

37
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,390
A little bit of controversy never hurt anybody.

38
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,320
Sure, depending on where you are I think.

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,920
Yes, you saw my deck.

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,640
I thought the deck was, as usual, fantastically done.

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,720
The slide with introducing the modern tester.

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
I drew that guy.

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,720
No, and actually, the thing is is that that guy.

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,960
So Alan in this deck, if you haven't seen it,

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,560
we'll probably post a link to it.

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
Maybe.

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
Drew a stick figure.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,280
And I will say it is one of the better stick figures

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
I've seen.

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,520
I think I could draw stick figures that good.

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,270
There was in high school, as an aside.

52
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,270
Tangent inception, thank you.

53
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,310
So in high school and in college,

54
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,310
you're required to take some sort of arts classes.

55
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,190
Theoretically, to round yourself out,

56
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,190
I'm sure you didn't have a problem with that.

57
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,230
Being a music major, I'm pretty certain that that counted.

58
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,670
So I always tended towards photography

59
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,870
because the way you do art with photography

60
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,230
is a little bit more scientific.

61
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,190
Exactly, it's a little bit more science-y.

62
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,310
How much light do I let in?

63
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,270
That's a science question.

64
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,310
Right.

65
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,430
And then it's about how you frame the shot.

66
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,860
And I always like doing sort of the different

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,540
sort of camera trick shots.

68
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,160
Like one of my favorite techniques was

69
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,040
taking the same picture three times,

70
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,100
but with a different lens.

71
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,100
So if you put a different color filter lens,

72
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,100
red, green, blue, and you take the same shot three times,

73
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,260
so you can set your camera typically,

74
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,300
well, this is old school cameras with film,

75
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,620
you can set it to not advance the film

76
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,020
until you want it to, you reduce the light

77
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,500
by obviously down to one third

78
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,700
because you're gonna take three shots.

79
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,460
But then what you do is you take it with a red filter,

80
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,050
then you move some stuff around,

81
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,810
then you take it with a green filter,

82
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,810
move stuff around again,

83
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,450
and then you take it with the blue filter,

84
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,850
and then you move stuff around.

85
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,370
And then what ends up happening is

86
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,820
the stuff you didn't move looks like a normal shot.

87
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,300
But the stuff you moved show up in your image

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,900
with the color of the filter that they were there.

89
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,220
That's cool, that's cool.

90
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,300
Very scientific formulaic approach to art, right?

91
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,820
Yeah, and then, I mean, there was another.

92
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,850
It's like following a recipe.

93
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,810
It is, it is.

94
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,050
It's by no means art, but it was fun,

95
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,810
and I guess that's part of art.

96
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,970
So this story came all out of the stick figure.

97
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,810
It did.

98
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,650
It did.

99
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,220
So I was talking to someone in Russia,

100
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,420
and luckily in English,

101
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,140
because my Russian is two words.

102
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,180
Da and what?

103
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,340
Spasiba.

104
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,300
It means thank you.

105
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,580
Oh, okay.

106
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,620
He says, I like your podcast.

107
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,340
Normally, I don't like when people do some banter

108
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,740
at the beginning of their podcast,

109
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,260
but with you guys, it's sometimes funny.

110
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,500
So I said, thank you.

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,580
Yeah, I mean, that's a higher bar

112
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,140
than we've been seeking, sometimes funny.

113
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,060
Indeed, indeed, indeed.

114
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,580
So there was something else I was gonna tell you.

115
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,420
Oh, I sent you some questions,

116
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,060
doing a lot of thinking and working over there,

117
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,940
both on my local team and on the presentation.

118
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,100
You can see that that's the presentation evolved

119
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,180
out of my technical testing presentation.

120
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,940
You can see it's, there's some remnants there,

121
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,700
but it's moved a lot forward.

122
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,540
And I will let you know, and the three know, asterisk,

123
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,460
that the stick figure and that slide will be returning

124
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,500
for my Test Bash Brighton talk

125
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,740
on the adventures of the modern day.

126
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,620
Oh, so yeah, you're not gonna pre-upload the deck.

127
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,420
This is, well, no, I can, I can, that's fine.

128
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,300
But definitely, as I started figuring out

129
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,940
what I was doing here at the, there at the conference

130
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,700
and like the message I wanted to send,

131
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,100
and basically, I originally went in with something closer

132
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,740
to my technical testing talk,

133
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,540
but the audience there was very technical.

134
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,500
There weren't a lot of this typical, at some conferences

135
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,580
and some circles of testers who were trying

136
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,580
to justify their job of refusing to be technical

137
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,260
or refusing to write code.

138
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,980
I mean, there's guys that, one of the presenters there

139
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,460
is one of the contributors to, I mean, actually,

140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,940
contributors to Selenium, contributors to Jenkins.

141
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,660
There's some fairly technical people there.

142
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,900
So I had, I wanted to go a little bit different direction

143
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,380
and talk about the modern tester a little bit more.

144
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,260
So that's what I did.

145
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,220
That's why it evolved that direction.

146
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,340
And I was really happy with where it ended up.

147
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,420
But how was the feedback of the presentation?

148
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,940
I haven't got the verbatim feedback.

149
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,340
I got tons of questions afterwards, lots of,

150
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,540
of the, you know, 10 people I talked to,

151
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,700
they all really liked it.

152
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,180
But I don't know if the other 200 hated it or,

153
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,330
we'll find out.

154
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,660
Oh, the other thing I've been doing,

155
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,340
I haven't written, except for running through some tutorials,

156
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,090
pretty much zero code since I started at Unity.

157
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,120
And one of my team members pointed me to this thing

158
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,710
called Advent of Code.

159
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,830
And this thing in December where there's a new

160
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,070
problem solving thing every day.

161
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,430
And I've been running through those.

162
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,790
It's, there's a kind of a stupid story,

163
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,710
I think stupid's fair, that goes along with it.

164
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,430
The days are supposed to get progressively harder.

165
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,070
But for me, it's more of a jagged, unpredictable thing.

166
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,390
Like two days ago, I struggled.

167
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,390
I understood, took me a while to understand the directions.

168
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,910
Then I kind of understood the problem,

169
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,870
just like, I just couldn't get my head around it.

170
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,990
And I thought, okay, it's just, given that,

171
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,830
this is probably the last day I do.

172
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,150
Then last nights came out, it's like,

173
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,110
oh shit, that's easy.

174
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,670
I did it like in half hour.

175
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,890
So I will keep on doing it.

176
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,110
I'm already 15 days in, I only have 10 days to go.

177
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,690
I saw your tweet when you did the first day.

178
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,590
And I went and looked at it and I'm like,

179
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,310
oh that looks fun.

180
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,350
You don't have time, but you're in a break

181
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,190
between classes, you can do it now.

182
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,150
Yeah, but now I would have to, I mean,

183
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,870
can I go back and do the old days?

184
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,710
Yeah, for sure.

185
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,950
So I did actually the first puzzle of the first day.

186
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,690
So when you sent out the tweet, that was day one,

187
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,390
and I did the first puzzle.

188
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,290
I don't know how often it happens,

189
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,690
but there's, at least on day one,

190
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,250
because I haven't gone to day two.

191
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,290
Here's the question.

192
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,890
What language did you do it in?

193
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,240
In this instance, like that first one,

194
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,120
I actually did it in Excel.

195
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,640
I did day three in Excel.

196
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,920
That's an Excel problem, I'll just do it there.

197
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,720
This is the weird thing working at Microsoft for so long.

198
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,400
I never really learned C-sharp.

199
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,480
I mean, I used it, but I wrote very procedural C-sharp,

200
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,040
didn't use much of the language.

201
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,720
I learned C-sharp and as listeners,

202
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,640
a long time listeners will recall,

203
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,120
I spent time as a dev lead.

204
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,120
But the last time someone commented on my C-sharp skills,

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,070
their phrasing was literally,

206
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,070
Brent, you have mad .NET 2.0 skills.

207
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,350
And this was at a time when 5.0 had already been chipped.

208
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,400
I've been learning a lot.

209
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,320
My C-sharp kind of sucks, but I'm getting better.

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,500
I learned link.

211
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,840
I wanted to never learn how it works

212
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
and it's some places where I thought it would work

213
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,560
and I kind of learned it.

214
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm learning a lot, I'm not very good at it.

215
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,040
I have full admission.

216
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,680
Last night when I saw problem 15, day 15,

217
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,440
I looked at it and said.

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm linking that up.

219
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,270
No, no, I thought, I know how to do this in C.

220
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,990
I wonder how long it'll take me to learn it in C-sharp.

221
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,750
And then I thought for about literally,

222
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,430
it felt like a long time, it was like half a second.

223
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,150
I said, screw it, I'm doing it in C.

224
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,130
So I did day 15 in C.

225
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,480
C++ actually.

226
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,120
C++ is something that I never really mastered.

227
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,080
I could code all day long in C,

228
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
but no one does that anymore,

229
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,240
except for maybe at school, at colleges.

230
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm waiting, because C is unfortunately,

231
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,280
at this point, still my strongest language.

232
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,000
So I'm hoping that someday there'll be a shortage

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,480
of C programmers and I can step up and make bank.

234
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,570
Sure.

235
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,410
Okay.

236
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,850
Yeah, the thing is, what was it?

237
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,130
I was talking to a mentee the other day

238
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,050
and they had gone through a interview

239
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,210
and I don't want this to go into a rant

240
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,010
because this is our big end of year show.

241
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,290
Way to foreshadow there.

242
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,430
Yeah.

243
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,430
This guy got rejected because he stated in a dev interview,

244
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,450
what I think, what I definitely agreed to be true.

245
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,520
And that is, once you understand how coding works,

246
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,240
the language is irrelevant.

247
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,070
That's absolutely true.

248
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,910
Yeah, so.

249
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,930
Did someone slam him on that?

250
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,850
Yeah, because he didn't know whatever language,

251
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,970
Java or JavaScript or whatever the language

252
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,990
that that guy wanted him to know, but he knew coding.

253
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,630
He knew how to do it in Python.

254
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,390
He knew how to do it in C sharp.

255
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,350
That statement you made is absolutely correct.

256
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,910
I would question the abilities

257
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,950
of anyone who disagreed with him.

258
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,290
I, yeah.

259
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,110
I told him, I'm like, hey, how long,

260
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,610
I asked him, he didn't know,

261
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,100
but how long do you think that guy has been in his position?

262
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,590
Because it's a behavior I see from people who,

263
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,870
you know, have just recently been promoted to management.

264
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,710
Right?

265
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,750
This is a, there's a belief that all I have to do

266
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,190
is keep doing what I did.

267
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,030
Because that's why they promoted me.

268
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,030
No.

269
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,630
And it takes a while for a new manager to realize,

270
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,370
no, what got me here isn't going to get me there.

271
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,450
All right, I could rant as well,

272
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,970
but I think instead.

273
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,250
I told this guy that, hey, don't worry about it,

274
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,490
because if that's how the,

275
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,570
like literally that guy did you a favor.

276
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,290
You don't want to work on that team.

277
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,690
No kidding.

278
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,530
Yeah.

279
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,350
No kidding.

280
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,290
And I'm going to curb my rant over this

281
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,730
and the causes that may happen.

282
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,420
And perhaps suggest that we start the show.

283
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,800
All right, let's do that.

284
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,440
Okay, it is our every year,

285
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,640
like we've been doing it for a long time.

286
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,040
This is our third, I don't think we did it the first year.

287
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,880
Maybe we did.

288
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,700
I don't remember.

289
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,640
But anyway, we are, end of year recap.

290
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,800
No, we did.

291
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
Okay.

292
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,460
We for sure did it our first year

293
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,440
because we started in March.

294
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,120
Coming up April, coming up on our,

295
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,860
now I forgot what I was doing

296
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,940
because Bright interrupted me.

297
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,420
But that's okay, that's what we do on this show.

298
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,980
End of the year show.

299
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,710
End of the year show, we're going to

300
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,190
have a little intro to, a re-intro to A-B testing.

301
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,710
If this is your first episode, raise your hand.

302
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,510
Put your hand back on the car wheel.

303
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,910
A little re-intro to A-B testing for any new listeners.

304
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,910
We're going to take a look back at the predictions

305
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,710
we slash Brent made for 2017

306
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,430
because I've forgotten mine.

307
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,470
Well, a little bit of a year in review,

308
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,290
kind of what happened with A-B testing over the years,

309
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,150
over the last year.

310
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,640
And then finally our predictions for 2018.

311
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
Sound good?

312
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,560
Yep, let's do it.

313
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,400
Okay, so the first thing is, there's a couple little

314
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,680
perhaps inside jokes, not jokes, inside statements,

315
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,520
things that maybe a new listener wouldn't understand.

316
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,360
So Brent, explain the title, A-B testing.

317
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,730
Is it about experimentation?

318
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,850
Sure.

319
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,210
Actually, no.

320
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,050
It is.

321
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,890
You are a crappy cohort.

322
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,110
No, so for those who haven't listened

323
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,910
and actually, we have seen on Twitter

324
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,190
that actually there's at least one person

325
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,990
that both Alan and I are aware of

326
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,630
that has started on recent episodes and going backwards.

327
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,910
They'll discover the inside language very quickly.

328
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,550
So A-B testing is essentially,

329
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,710
it's a, in my view, it's a double entendre.

330
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,310
It is number one, it stands for Alan and Brent testing.

331
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,190
There's no slash in the A-B testing.

332
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,470
But when we first started the show,

333
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,190
for those who haven't listened,

334
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,190
both Alan and I, I think we still were both in test.

335
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,240
No, I wasn't at that point in time.

336
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,880
But we both saw that data was becoming more prevalent.

337
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,800
So I thought the name A-B testing

338
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,920
would not only allow us to sort of cover

339
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,310
the testing sort of themes,

340
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,470
but it would be a great name that would allow us

341
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,030
to carry on and go into data science-y themes.

342
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,320
And I think it's proven out correct.

343
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,480
Very happy with the name.

344
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,280
So A-B testing, Alan and Brent,

345
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,240
sometimes about A-B experimentation.

346
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,320
Sometimes, yes.

347
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
All right.

348
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,780
I think we had two episodes where you were talking about,

349
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,220
you talking about actual.

350
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,860
Yeah, since we've been giving this podcast,

351
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,140
I gave, at one point,

352
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,300
I was asked to come in at the last minute

353
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,380
fill in for someone who canceled giving a talk

354
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,380
on A-B testing at a dev conference in Las Vegas.

355
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,140
And the talk went well enough that they asked me

356
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,460
to come back and give a regular workshop on A-B testing,

357
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,660
which I did a couple, maybe two years ago.

358
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,500
Nice.

359
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,780
So yeah, and that's where I,

360
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,300
I like doing that because I could talk about it

361
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,380
and I threw out like math terms that Brent said,

362
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,500
oh my God, Alan may actually know what he's doing.

363
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,980
Even if he doesn't, he used the correct math term.

364
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,260
Like, you know, hey, fake it till you make it.

365
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,100
Story of my career.

366
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,940
You're there to teach.

367
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,780
So there's another.

368
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,900
It's irrelevant whether or not

369
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,980
you know what you're teaching.

370
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,820
There's another term we throw out.

371
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,900
We reference the three or one of the three all the time.

372
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,740
Yep.

373
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,380
Brent, what does that mean?

374
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,300
What is all that about?

375
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,780
Oh, that's in reference to the fact

376
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,740
that we are just a low production crappy podcast

377
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,660
and have only three listeners.

378
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,500
Look, we are a high production crappy podcast.

379
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,780
When we first started, we joked a lot

380
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,540
about our three listeners.

381
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,940
In fact, we knew them

382
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,460
because they were mostly Microsoft people.

383
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,300
And so we joked about our three listeners

384
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,060
and when someone asked a question,

385
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,100
we sure it was one of the three.

386
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,500
And while we know there are many more

387
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,220
than three listeners now,

388
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,500
we still like to refer to our listeners

389
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,460
and thank you very much for listening, by the way.

390
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,340
If you're listening still,

391
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,860
if you haven't given up on this podcast,

392
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,380
for being one of the three,

393
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,380
even though three has turned into a metaphor for many.

394
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,300
So we refer to the three a lot.

395
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,740
It will always be part of our nomenclature,

396
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,140
but the three refers to all of our listeners.

397
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes.

398
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,120
And probably worth mentioning is

399
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,520
because we don't have,

400
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,000
and this is probably a prediction

401
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,560
or a goal or a work item for 2018,

402
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,640
we should probably have some small bios

403
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,020
on the A-B testing site.

404
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,740
But then again, most people just subscribe to the podcast

405
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,180
and don't actually go to the website.

406
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,460
But we both worked at Microsoft for a long time.

407
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,620
Brent still works at Microsoft.

408
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,180
And I work at Unity Technologies.

409
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,100
Focusing on quality, but from a data perspective

410
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,420
on something we call the modern tester,

411
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,100
which we've talked about many times on the show.

412
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,380
I'm not gonna give a recap of that,

413
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,820
but I think it's something that will probably come up

414
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,940
in just about every show for a while.

415
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,780
Yeah.

416
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,500
And Brent is a principal data science manager

417
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,900
at Data Science Manager at Microsoft still.

418
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,940
And we get together every few weeks

419
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,700
and record this podcast.

420
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,540
If you're a new listener,

421
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,980
that's kind of the gist of who we are.

422
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,780
Let's get on to the meat of the show,

423
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,620
which is, was it predictions from last year?

424
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,820
You're not gonna do number one?

425
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,480
Number one is part of the predictions from last year.

426
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,960
Oh, you wanna do predictions from last year?

427
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,800
Okay. Yeah.

428
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,120
Gotcha.

429
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,480
Okay, so I'm gonna read them here

430
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,760
cause I have them in front of me.

431
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,560
2017 predictions from Brent.

432
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,160
And again, I don't remember mine.

433
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,960
And last year's prediction show had horrible audio

434
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,480
and I had to cut them off.

435
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,840
Something weird happened.

436
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,060
I'm blaming it on Microsoft.

437
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,620
Number one, Brent, we will finally have

438
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,220
A-B testing branded gear on Cafe Press.

439
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,810
Did that happen?

440
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,290
It did.

441
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,410
Actually, it did.

442
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,970
I think I've only told Brent

443
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,970
and those on our Slack team,

444
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,890
one of the three.slack.com,

445
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,610
DM me, Alan Page, A-L-A-N-P-A-G-E on Twitter

446
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,610
with your email address and I'll get you signed up.

447
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,370
But we have a Cafe Press store, minimal right now.

448
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,570
Happy to take feedback any way you can get a hold of me

449
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,530
if you want to see different items.

450
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,530
I don't have much or really any influence on the price.

451
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,570
I think I've already knocked everything down

452
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,170
so we're making zero off of those

453
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,810
cause if you want A-B testing stuff,

454
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,850
you should be able to buy it.

455
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,250
And Brent is here by the way

456
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,770
with an A-B testing coffee cup and polo shirt today.

457
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,610
Yes.

458
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,610
So I'm fairly certain we have made two sales so far.

459
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,650
That is excellent.

460
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,690
That is excellent.

461
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,250
But just in time, you can, I think,

462
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,410
if you order today,

463
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,610
today meaning whenever I get this episode out,

464
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,090
maybe you'll get it in time for Christmas.

465
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,930
I don't know.

466
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,090
But before I forget,

467
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,850
and I'll guarantee I'll put this in the show notes,

468
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,010
it's just cafepress.com,

469
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,970
WAC, A-B testing.

470
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,310
Yeah, and again, Alan and I have talked about it.

471
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
We're not making any money on that.

472
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,360
As Alan was saying,

473
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,190
we kind of do this because we find it fun

474
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,820
and we like to help influence change

475
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,220
in these particular industries.

476
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,740
We're not here to turn a buck.

477
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,700
If for some reason you're interested in it,

478
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,640
it's now available, knock yourself out.

479
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,240
We went through,

480
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
no, that's probably pretty early,

481
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,830
but I'll give a pre-step.

482
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,110
Like one of the things I think was the coolest thing,

483
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,470
one of the coolest things we did this last year

484
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,550
is all the logo rebranding stuff.

485
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,750
Yeah, let's just jump topics completely

486
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,370
into the year in review.

487
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,080
Sure.

488
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,160
We'll bounce back and forth.

489
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,280
That's what I just did.

490
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,800
Yeah, thanks.

491
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Right, but yeah,

492
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,200
so there's been some discussion on the Slack channel

493
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,080
that maybe someday we'll put together an A-B conference.

494
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,960
And if we do that,

495
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,160
then we'll probably have to go someplace

496
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,560
other than cafepress

497
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,800
because to print out and produce swag.

498
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
I'm not thinking that far ahead,

499
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,640
but as far as the main point Brent was making,

500
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,560
yeah, we occasionally, as you know,

501
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,320
we will have advertisers on the show

502
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,040
and who give us a little bit of coin our way,

503
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,440
which mainly goes towards recording equipment,

504
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,120
hosting stickers that we sent out

505
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,280
to many of the listeners that asked for them,

506
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,320
things like that.

507
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,310
It goes back to essentially you guys.

508
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,150
Absolutely.

509
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,560
Let's get on with your predictions.

510
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,160
Okay, so one of the things,

511
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,960
and I think it's aligned with what you just said,

512
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,900
one of the most common things that happened

513
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,180
in the last few years is people are pinging us now,

514
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,060
hey, Brent, what episode did you talk about this

515
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,820
or that thing?

516
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,940
And I go, oh dear God, I don't know.

517
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,380
Someone should frickin' title these damn things.

518
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,620
I predict that I will actually get off my lazy ass

519
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,900
and actually title the episodes.

520
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,790
In addition to that, I'm gonna get them transcribed.

521
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,470
We have a whole topic on the whiteboard

522
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,590
on predictions, on last year's predictions,

523
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,670
and then the year in review,

524
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,270
and then our predictions for 2018,

525
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,270
but you don't seem to care about any sort of order.

526
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,230
Oh, you're talking about our last year's predictions.

527
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,430
You said predictions.

528
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,790
All right, fine.

529
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,630
Yeah, you're right.

530
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,030
I don't care about order.

531
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,190
Let me get back into the order carrying mode.

532
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,230
Let's just retitle, screw A B testing.

533
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,070
We'll just call this podcast My Co-host is a Moron.

534
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,440
Welcome to the My Co-host is a Moron podcast.

535
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm Alan.

536
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,150
So back on 2019.

537
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,670
All right, so our year in review,

538
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,510
our last year's predictions.

539
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,350
Let's go back.

540
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,590
I'm gonna read them to you

541
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,790
so you don't get so damn confused, all right?

542
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,630
All right.

543
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,470
Number one, we did it, yes.

544
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,950
Yeah, we have a cafe press store,

545
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,390
cafepress.com, like A B testing.

546
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,430
Brent says he will finally graduate.

547
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,350
Have you graduated?

548
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,910
No.

549
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,310
Are you about to graduate?

550
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,670
I have, I...

551
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,670
One more quarter, right?

552
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,510
Two more?

553
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,430
I await the results as to whether or not

554
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,110
I have passed this current class,

555
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,510
and if I have, then I have one class left.

556
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,590
I'm sure you passed.

557
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,150
Congratulations, Brent.

558
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,990
Yep.

559
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,190
Dev learning knowledge, machine learning,

560
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,560
is required at most schools for comp sci.

561
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,760
I don't know if that's...

562
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,320
I haven't researched that.

563
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
I don't know if that's true or not.

564
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
I definitely think that will happen at some point.

565
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,440
I do think it's growing up.

566
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,960
And it could just be because I sit right next

567
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,760
to our machine learning team at Unity,

568
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,880
but it seems there's a lot more emphasis.

569
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,000
And it could be, there's a bias

570
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,720
where I may just notice machine learning

571
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,880
and AI more in the news and articles.

572
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,040
We'll talk more about that,

573
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,240
but it is not just a bias.

574
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,080
Okay.

575
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,320
Yeah.

576
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,000
Deep learning will finally hit buzzword status.

577
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,050
I don't know if it did or not, man.

578
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:27,050
No, it's actually, it not only hasn't hit buzzword status,

579
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,250
or it did, and it went through it pretty quickly.

580
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,450
Like, now, back a year ago,

581
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,650
people were talking about it all the time.

582
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,880
Now it's just like, eh, another AI thing.

583
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,720
Okay.

584
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
Yeah.

585
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,400
All right.

586
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,620
So the prediction was around data-driven testing.

587
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,780
I don't know.

588
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,620
All right.

589
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,460
Well, there was a prediction.

590
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,700
Well, I'm gonna assume it came through then.

591
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,700
So this year, I'm looking over at the recording,

592
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
and I'm not seeing all the buzzy things

593
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,100
that were popping in last year.

594
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,740
So we may actually get all the way

595
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,180
to our predictions this time,

596
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,500
if the clock doesn't run out and a Brent can stay on track.

597
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,500
So not a wonderful recap of last year's predictions

598
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,640
because we couldn't quite remember them,

599
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,700
but we got the cafe press store up

600
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,100
and stuff is moving along.

601
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,580
I don't know if we'll have predictions

602
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,060
as much as goals this year.

603
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,480
I may think of something in the spur of the moment

604
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,220
coming up here in about 15 minutes, but.

605
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,060
Yep.

606
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,420
Let's go ahead and do you wanna talk,

607
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,500
do you mind talking about 2017

608
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,100
and kind of everything that happened?

609
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,020
Or can I start?

610
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,860
Do you wanna start?

611
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,700
How do you want?

612
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,940
No, so 2017, big year for us.

613
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:43,060
We had multiple different sponsors

614
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,700
interested in reaching out.

615
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,260
We had, I'm gonna go ahead and give another free shout out.

616
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,410
So a lot of, we had Star on the show several times

617
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,170
for each of their conferences with promo codes.

618
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,130
We had Cobitan on the show a couple times

619
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,450
with some promo codes.

620
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,450
And we're going to have some new sponsors in 2018.

621
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,290
And again, one thing about our sponsors is,

622
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,070
as I said before, we're not here to make a buck.

623
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,630
So when someone approaches us about sponsorship,

624
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,890
it's always like, is this a product that I would use?

625
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,310
Maybe not one that I can use now,

626
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,270
but if I was testing the sort of thing

627
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,510
that this helps me with,

628
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,870
or if I had the sort of problem

629
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,270
this is supposed to help solve,

630
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,790
is this something I would consider?

631
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,630
So we're.

632
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,470
Or is it something we think our listeners

633
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,790
would actually use?

634
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,870
Yeah, absolutely.

635
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,670
So we do try and be careful about those things.

636
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,470
We'll have a few more in,

637
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,470
and if you're listening and you would like us

638
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,270
to advertise for whatever you're showing,

639
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,510
we're pretty cheap.

640
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,110
Because again, thought about making money.

641
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,290
It's about paying for web hosting,

642
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,070
trying to keep great A-B testing episodes

643
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,270
continuing to come.

644
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,630
Speaking of which, this is not a sponsor,

645
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,310
but if any of you are thinking

646
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,110
of getting into audiobooks,

647
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,190
of course you can go to Audible,

648
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,630
audible.com, WAC A-B testing.

649
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,590
This is Alan jumping in during post-production.

650
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,830
The actual link is audibletrial.com,

651
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,510
WAC A-B testing.

652
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,090
Thanks.

653
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,490
Check out and just use that.

654
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,390
You'll get the first month free

655
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,530
and you can check it out.

656
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,370
Yeah.

657
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,400
I've been thinking about,

658
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,960
I normally don't like audiobooks.

659
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,800
I normally have a problem with audiobooks

660
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,100
because I can read faster.

661
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,980
But I've been,

662
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,820
that read faster. Can you?

663
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,980
I can usually read faster

664
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,980
than I can have the book read to me.

665
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,980
But I've been running a lot in 2017.

666
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,060
My goal was to run 510 miles,

667
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,940
which would have been 10 miles

668
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,020
for every year I was alive.

669
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,700
I turned 52 last month.

670
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,120
Deep into the tangents,

671
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,900
which for new listeners we're famous for,

672
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,220
between travel and the new job and things,

673
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,140
I don't think I'm gonna quite make it.

674
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,860
I'm around 460 right now.

675
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,020
I'm not sure I can get 50 miles in

676
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,520
before the end of the year.

677
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,000
10 miles every other day.

678
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,840
Done, dude.

679
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,680
Yeah.

680
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,520
But I've been thinking,

681
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,200
I've been getting kind of burned out listening to music.

682
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Podcasts, I usually run longer than the podcast last.

683
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,160
I was thinking maybe about getting into audiobooks

684
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,920
and listening to books while I run.

685
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,600
I'll keep the listeners posted.

686
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,640
And again, if you do wanna hit that goal,

687
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,400
you'll have plenty of time.

688
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,280
If you wanna hit your running goal for the year,

689
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
you have plenty of time.

690
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,400
I have two weeks.

691
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Right.

692
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,480
So back in the day when I was actually in cross country,

693
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,720
when we were in training season,

694
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,280
we'd run a minimum of 10 miles every day.

695
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,200
Yeah.

696
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,240
I'm old.

697
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,960
It's hard for me to go that far on a daily basis.

698
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,780
All right.

699
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,200
Okay, I will do my best.

700
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,960
I will be your pro fan.

701
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,360
So let me talk a little bit about 2017 from my perspective.

702
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,280
Go ahead.

703
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,200
The first episode last year

704
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,640
is when I announced I was leaving Microsoft.

705
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,760
In fact, it was just almost exactly a year ago

706
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,200
when I accepted the offer at Unity.

707
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,760
Wow, what a year it's been.

708
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,200
That year went by fast.

709
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,320
It did, didn't it?

710
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,260
And then we had a show on my very last day

711
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,360
at Microsoft on a Friday,

712
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,500
and Brent brought in some wonderful tequila,

713
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,800
which we drank on the air at eight in the morning.

714
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,520
So that was a fun day.

715
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,760
It was a fun day.

716
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,480
I had early in my Unity career,

717
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,440
I had the realization that what I run

718
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,800
isn't an organization as much as a community.

719
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,440
I was very, very proud of my ability to recognize that.

720
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,160
And then later in the year,

721
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,920
I went and reread Agile Testing,

722
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,200
the Chris Ben Gregory book that we both like a lot.

723
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,560
There was a chapter right in there

724
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,920
that said just like in one paragraph,

725
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,320
it talked about the exact same thing,

726
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,120
how it's more of a community.

727
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,160
I think this is the year, 2017,

728
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,960
if you take it all up, I think it's the year

729
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,480
from our perspective of the modern testers.

730
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
And yeah, because I want-

731
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,920
And I think all of it kind of fed into it.

732
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,360
You going into this, you realizing like,

733
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,400
hey, I wanna start something new.

734
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,800
I want these guys to be heading in the correct direction.

735
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,640
What is it?

736
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,720
And I think as you and I have talked on the air

737
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,600
and off air around what you're going through,

738
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,960
we've sort of formalized the sort of concept.

739
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah, and when we think about modern testing,

740
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,520
it definitely is a huge basis,

741
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,720
huge Venn diagram with Agile Testing.

742
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Yeah, for sure.

743
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,280
With some plus pluses in there.

744
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,520
And I talked to my whole team knows that

745
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,720
the way I look at my role is I run this community,

746
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,680
I am in the process of slowly moving,

747
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,520
in fact, not slowly,

748
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,760
I moved a big chunk of my org to not report to me.

749
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,720
So we changed the dotted lines and the solid lines.

750
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,240
And they're still part of my community,

751
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,350
they're gonna report to other people.

752
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,430
Eventually, I'd like every one of my org

753
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,630
to report to other people,

754
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,390
and I will still run the community.

755
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,550
I will still coach them and help them,

756
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,910
help them educate developers they work with.

757
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,100
And then eventually,

758
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,420
when that community can become self-sustaining,

759
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
then my role is no longer needed.

760
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,580
And that is, I think,

761
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,940
the natural evolution of modern testing,

762
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,420
where the testers actually become full,

763
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,870
they don't need a director of quality

764
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,630
to help them be successful in their job.

765
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,070
They know enough about how to make things work,

766
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,510
and they've influenced the dev team,

767
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,190
and the dev team understands

768
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,630
how to leverage a quality and testing expert,

769
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,710
and what full team quality ownership looks like,

770
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,710
and how to use data,

771
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,910
and those things are just natural to how they work.

772
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,670
I am absolutely not needed.

773
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,790
And everybody knows that won't happen tomorrow,

774
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,030
or next week, or next month, or probably next year,

775
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,830
but they also agree that the direction makes sense.

776
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,570
Yeah, and the thing I think

777
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,710
that's particularly great about this,

778
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,310
and I've seen it over and over again,

779
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,070
the number one thing that slows down Agile

780
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,060
is command and control.

781
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,420
And if you wanna get your team to spin up,

782
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,570
you gotta have brave,

783
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,090
I don't know why it takes brave leaders,

784
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,250
but it seems to,

785
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,090
you have to have brave leaders that are like,

786
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,480
no, I am going to direct

787
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,880
the removal of command and control from the system.

788
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,960
So slight tangent rant.

789
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,440
Is there a tan rant, tangent rant, tangent rant?

790
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,280
Rangent?

791
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,480
Rangent, I don't know.

792
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,300
Okay.

793
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,340
So many times I see either one or the other,

794
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,380
or a combination of the two of Agile doesn't work,

795
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,280
and here's why,

796
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,940
and they explain what they're doing is not even Agile at all.

797
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,740
And then a focus in Agile on the iteration

798
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,300
versus the adaptation.

799
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,380
What I'm talking about in my role is purely adaptive.

800
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,900
It's the way the org should adapt to being more efficient.

801
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,320
The way the org should adapt to a word

802
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,100
we've used a lot this year,

803
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,860
accelerating a phrase,

804
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,420
accelerating the achievement of shippable quality.

805
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,460
We've actually talked about specialists as well,

806
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,620
and it occurs to me, right?

807
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,460
What is the head of a command and control system?

808
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,380
They're essentially a specialist in decision making

809
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,940
for that business context.

810
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,860
Specialists or bottlenecks in this Agile world?

811
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,460
I think so, yeah, absolutely.

812
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,540
Right.

813
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,940
If you,

814
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,800
like you say you're gonna work to remove your job,

815
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,560
and at some point in time, maybe you will,

816
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,940
but maybe also Unity grows,

817
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,880
and instead you end up having to scale

818
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,280
to several hundred or several thousand people, right?

819
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,280
That should be fine because you're shooting out principles.

820
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,480
It's adaptation.

821
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,280
It's looking at the context and adapting.

822
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,440
It's not, like I have a map in place

823
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,200
and I know that I talk a lot about current state

824
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,560
and desired state, and desired state is a moving target,

825
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,760
and that's fine.

826
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,400
I think the key to success in any sort of knowledge work,

827
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,840
but in software where I tend to have some specialization,

828
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,900
is in willing to be adaptive

829
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,600
and not getting stuck into a formulaic rights.

830
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,900
Yep.

831
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,700
We also talked, in talking about modern testing,

832
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,380
couple of my favorite episodes,

833
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,060
maybe my second favorite is the time machine episode

834
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,300
where Brent pretended to be a traditional test manager.

835
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,140
That was fun.

836
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,980
And I was the modern test manager,

837
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,860
and Brent tried to tell me how stupid he was,

838
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,260
and I tried to tell you how easy my life was,

839
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,700
and it was a good time.

840
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,820
But my favorite episode was episode 60.

841
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,660
Yep.

842
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,820
That's a shared favorite.

843
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,660
It is.

844
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,820
I think we managed to capture a lot of the things

845
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,540
we really care about and are passionate about

846
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,500
in a way that actually made sense.

847
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,460
So if you're working your way backward or jumping around,

848
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,780
60 is one that we recommend.

849
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,940
Yeah, if you're only gonna listen to one episode,

850
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,620
stop listening to this one right now,

851
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,720
and go to 60.

852
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,080
Yeah, no, I was particularly proud of that episode.

853
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,680
I think we really gelled a bunch of concepts together.

854
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,600
It really inspired a lot of conversation

855
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,120
on the Slack channel and other places.

856
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,180
And what I'm particularly happy about is,

857
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,060
what I observed from some of our listeners

858
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,660
is it really inspired action.

859
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,620
A lot of people were sitting around and going,

860
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,580
oh, well, I got time so I can do it.

861
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,820
And what I see is it really got people going,

862
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,220
you know what, I actually don't know how much time I have,

863
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,060
and even if I have a lot of time,

864
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,340
it seems like going down this approach

865
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,540
is gonna make my life better anyway.

866
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,310
And I know, for example,

867
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,970
there's one of our listeners that's actually doing

868
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,610
in his job now several of the things

869
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,270
that we have described on the podcast.

870
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:19,110
There's more than one, at least,

871
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,830
because one thing is weird, at Microsoft,

872
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,670
we have some listeners at Microsoft,

873
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,350
but when I was at Microsoft, nobody on my team,

874
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,910
except for maybe one occasionally,

875
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,790
would ever listen to the podcast.

876
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,550
But I have, as we've been going on here,

877
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,230
I've been growing the listeners among my team,

878
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,390
which makes me a little self-conscious,

879
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,790
but I don't think I've said anything to embarrass them

880
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,050
or incriminate them or me, so I think it's all right.

881
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:48,400
But I have listeners on my team, in my community.

882
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,800
None of my coworkers, employees listen,

883
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,240
and I think it's fairly clear why.

884
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,030
They get enough of listening to me babble day to day,

885
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,170
why would they wanna do more of it?

886
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,170
Yeah, and a lot of my team, of course,

887
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,710
because they're embedded in another team,

888
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,950
they interact with me for a half hour to an hour a week

889
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,210
during one-on-ones usually.

890
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,810
My leads get a little bit more time in general,

891
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,910
but they don't hear me babble all the time.

892
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,790
So maybe this is their chance.

893
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,250
So it's an opportunity for them to maybe understand

894
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,690
some of the things that you're saying better.

895
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,710
Sure, sure, sure.

896
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,030
I want to, before we get run out of time,

897
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,430
go ahead and dive forward into some predictions

898
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,090
and comments about, I don't know if it's predictions,

899
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,850
goals, things I think they're gonna happen in 2018.

900
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,730
And maybe, do you just wanna go back and forth?

901
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,010
You wanna give one or I'll give one,

902
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,270
and we'll go till we run out of time?

903
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,110
Sure.

904
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,930
Do you wanna start?

905
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,440
I'm gonna start.

906
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,920
Well, so one of the things that we normally did,

907
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,240
and it got truncated off as we try to predict

908
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,280
what episode this show will be next year.

909
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,960
So we did 22 episodes this last year.

910
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,600
We did 22 episodes.

911
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,080
And I think that's one of the more productive years

912
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,920
we've done.

913
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,050
I'm gonna guess it's our most productive year.

914
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,730
Yep, I didn't do that analysis.

915
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,730
I could do that math,

916
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,170
but I'm gonna pretty much say that's right.

917
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,210
But I vaguely recall, it got clipped off,

918
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,210
but I vaguely recall that we predicted

919
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,000
that we would be somewhere in the 70s this time around.

920
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,400
But we don't have proof.

921
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,520
I can't remember last week, let alone last year.

922
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,080
But one of the things I was thinking about is,

923
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,320
so I will say,

924
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,620
we will not do episode 100 next year.

925
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,620
That is correct.

926
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:45,090
And I will say, but we'll get really darn close.

927
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,690
So I am hoping, now I have a,

928
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,070
I'm gonna go beyond that prediction.

929
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,950
I'm hoping we're kinda close to 22 next year.

930
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,230
And then I did the math right.

931
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,710
I'm not gonna do it out for you on the air,

932
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,230
but we started the podcast in early April.

933
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,210
So this April will be our four year anniversary.

934
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,170
So we have a reasonable chance,

935
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,670
this is looking ahead to 2019,

936
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,590
assuming we're both still alive,

937
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,070
we have a reasonable chance of hitting episode 100

938
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,300
on our fifth anniversary of podcasting.

939
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,260
And that would be kind of awesome.

940
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,820
There would definitely be a deal of it.

941
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,740
No, we could do that, but I think we're gonna be

942
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,180
like 99 by the end of next year.

943
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,500
If we do 22 episodes next year, we'll be at?

944
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,920
98.

945
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,760
What do we have, 73?

946
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,000
No, 95.

947
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
95.

948
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,280
Then we do two in January, 96, 97.

949
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,480
Two in February, 98, 99.

950
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,440
March, we take off.

951
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,590
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

952
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,270
We'll see what happens, it'll be close.

953
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,310
So it'll happen around the right times.

954
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,310
But yeah, I think you're about right.

955
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,830
And actually, I traveled a lot,

956
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,710
we had some cancellations, we got in 22,

957
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,910
which I think is...

958
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,710
So I'm gonna predict that we will not do

959
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,230
as good as next year as we did this year.

960
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:09,310
And I'll predict that this episode,

961
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,890
this time next year, will be episode 90.

962
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,870
I'm gonna say it's going to be 92.

963
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,710
Okay.

964
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,550
All right, we'll...

965
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,750
All right, your prediction.

966
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:27,780
This, I think 2018 is the year of modern testing.

967
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,220
And I'm gonna elaborate on that.

968
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,940
I think it's a term we've used a lot

969
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,420
to describe what we think the future

970
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,300
of the quality specialist rule is.

971
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,700
Right now, today, if you were to go to moderntesting.org,

972
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,300
you would get redirected to angryweasel.com,

973
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,880
WackAB testing.

974
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,120
One of the things I like to do with,

975
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,820
not overflowing, but with our funds

976
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,660
and our bank account,

977
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,740
and paying for some transcription of our episodes,

978
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,330
is hosting for moderntesting.org

979
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,930
and turning that into a real website

980
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,530
with information around modern testing.

981
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,010
And I think...

982
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,370
A community site.

983
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,890
A community site, just with information,

984
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,970
with links, we'll put links to videos.

985
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,610
At the online test conference,

986
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,090
Danny Fott just gave a talk about modern testing,

987
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,370
links to YouTube videos like that.

988
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,730
Links to my decks on modern testing, to your stuff.

989
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,050
Of course, a link to the AB testing podcast.

990
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,330
I think I'd like for that in 2018

991
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,610
for moderntesting.org to become a real website.

992
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,690
And for, I think, my prediction is

993
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,100
we will see more references to modern testing as a thing.

994
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,460
And maybe I'll rephrase it this way.

995
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,870
In 2018, modern testing becomes, air quote, a thing.

996
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,090
Okay, that's a good prediction.

997
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,250
I actually...

998
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,810
That's more of a goal than a prediction,

999
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,450
but I'm gonna go for it, we'll see what happens.

1000
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,970
Well, so a lot of it is out of your control, right?

1001
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,450
It assumes that our content is good enough

1002
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,250
and other people contribute and it goes viral.

1003
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,050
So at the online test conference,

1004
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,050
I don't recall his last name,

1005
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,130
but Jesper also talked about the AP testing podcast.

1006
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,850
I haven't seen that deck or heard his presentation.

1007
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,130
So I don't know what the content was.

1008
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,650
But I assume...

1009
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,070
He was talking a lot about the shift left concept.

1010
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,990
Okay, so that's probably aligned with the modern tester.

1011
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,830
It is, I don't like that term shift left.

1012
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,830
I think it's kind of, anyway, as an aside, I...

1013
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,710
But I had almost written down

1014
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,510
and I was trying to figure out how I could evaluate this

1015
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,790
and see if it's reasonable.

1016
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:47,790
But my instinct, so I guess this is literally

1017
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,030
a baseless prediction.

1018
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,020
And it's similar to what you're saying,

1019
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:59,280
is my prediction is sometime in the next two years

1020
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,360
and perhaps as early as next year,

1021
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,120
we see a tipping point in the job title

1022
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,120
of software test engineer

1023
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,960
and that the rate that those jobs get opened

1024
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,920
starts to go on the decline.

1025
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,800
Yeah, I think that's a tough one

1026
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,960
because there's so many trailing companies.

1027
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,200
There are companies today that are going,

1028
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,640
hey, maybe we need SDets.

1029
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,440
Yeah, and again, it's entirely baseless.

1030
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,960
I spent a good hour looking for how could I trend this?

1031
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,120
How could I evaluate it?

1032
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,800
I thought about going to like on air and say,

1033
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,360
okay, here's how we can start doing it.

1034
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,920
As of this point in time, I'm going to monster.com

1035
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,840
and I'm typing software test engineer,

1036
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,760
oh look, there's 43,000 jobs available.

1037
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,600
Let's see what happens next year.

1038
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,520
Yeah, and my team's going through,

1039
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,600
I'm having a thought discussion,

1040
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,330
I exercised my team to try and think of,

1041
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,570
if we were to have new titles,

1042
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,510
what would that new title be?

1043
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,710
And that's going through a lot of vetting right now.

1044
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,550
Don't do test, Ninja.

1045
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,950
No, absolutely not.

1046
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,650
All right, but that I didn't put down,

1047
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,930
but I do have a sense that it's coming soon

1048
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,130
because it feels a lot,

1049
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,610
like the global environment to me,

1050
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,690
feels a lot like it did when it began to start here.

1051
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,790
Lots of discussion around this thing.

1052
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,790
We're seeing visibility into around the world.

1053
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,990
People are having these type of conversations,

1054
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,350
hey, does this make sense that we change?

1055
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,990
And once those solidify,

1056
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,820
the tipping point really begins to happen.

1057
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,220
My number one prediction is similar.

1058
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,890
This is the, similar to what we talked about last,

1059
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:53,180
that machine learning would be a product required curriculum.

1060
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,700
I actually see next year AI is democratized

1061
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,960
and service development knowledge of how to use ML APIs.

1062
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,590
The simple ones is common

1063
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:15,450
and use all, the majority of service developers

1064
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,840
are perfectly comfortable calling ML APIs

1065
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,650
and they don't need to do the rich data science

1066
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,620
validation stuff that I do.

1067
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,460
Along those same lines,

1068
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,340
I think that 2018 is the year when we begin to see

1069
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,380
machine learning officially creep its way

1070
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,690
into test automation.

1071
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,090
It's already in.

1072
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,050
Not mainstream.

1073
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,070
Oh, mainstream, yeah.

1074
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,790
I think it's something that's recognized.

1075
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,030
There will be tool vendors beginning to come out

1076
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:54,430
with machine learning algorithms

1077
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:56,830
or machine learning to apply to test automation,

1078
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,070
whether it's from current test automation vendors

1079
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,910
or widely used open source things

1080
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,110
used with existing test automation solutions.

1081
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:09,590
For example, use FUBAR machine learning with your selenium

1082
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:14,550
to make your tests more robust and get more coverage.

1083
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,430
I think that makes sense.

1084
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,830
I think that will happen this next year.

1085
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,030
And if it does,

1086
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,430
then I think the tipping point discussion I just had

1087
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,630
is far more likely.

1088
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,310
Someone at, in one of my questions

1089
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,710
after my automation talk at Heisenberg,

1090
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,710
someone asked, will machine learning replace the need

1091
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,110
for manual testers?

1092
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,950
I said, well, indirectly because machine learning

1093
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,370
will reduce the need for automated testers.

1094
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:41,570
People who write test automation,

1095
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,090
not people who are automated by testing.

1096
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,330
Machine learning will reduce the need

1097
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,770
for people to write test automation.

1098
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,690
There will be less test automation needed.

1099
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,930
I said it better then.

1100
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,240
Yeah.

1101
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,560
You and I are aware of many different projects

1102
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,320
that are now like 15 years old

1103
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,560
within Microsoft that was using AI for test functions.

1104
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,040
There was one that was using genetic algorithms

1105
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,280
quite successfully to find bugs all the time,

1106
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,760
but it was horrible at determining

1107
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,200
is this an important bug or not.

1108
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,560
That's because this was in a on-prem,

1109
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,200
this was in a different world.

1110
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Yeah.

1111
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,680
It didn't have access to customer usage information.

1112
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,520
Right.

1113
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,680
That's where the marriage comes in.

1114
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,640
That's the way exactly what I described at Heisenberg.

1115
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,400
I said, we're really close with the democratization

1116
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,080
and the ubiquitousness of customer data,

1117
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,840
being able to use that as a feed

1118
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,440
along with our test inputs and our test knowledge,

1119
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,880
those things are going to marry

1120
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,360
and actually use machine learning to find bugs

1121
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,480
that actually matter and find them quickly

1122
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,800
and find a lot of them.

1123
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,650
Right.

1124
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:55,230
I'm actually thinking about my own project right now

1125
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,200
and I'm like, you know what?

1126
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,960
I know my dev managers, the directors,

1127
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,160
I talk to them all the time

1128
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,080
and I know that they would find this valuable

1129
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,760
and I think actually this wouldn't be too hard.

1130
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,720
All right, back on track here.

1131
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,450
Give me another prediction.

1132
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,350
I will finally graduate.

1133
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,510
You will finally graduate, yes.

1134
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:22,960
And I will reboot blogging.

1135
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,240
On reboot, I don't know to what degree.

1136
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:31,390
As you know, I own my blog site brand right now,

1137
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,630
but as you also know,

1138
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:38,470
I no longer really identify with my blog site brand

1139
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,470
so a reboot may be necessary.

1140
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,840
Yeah, but that will happen.

1141
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,680
Trying to think if I have another one.

1142
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,880
It's a self-fulfilling prediction.

1143
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,280
I'm going to let you go on.

1144
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,200
All right, and then I would say the last

1145
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,800
and absolutely the most important is

1146
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,880
I predict over the next year

1147
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,440
that Kylo Ren will be revealed as Darth Reven.

1148
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,540
Doesn't Star Wars come out today?

1149
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,380
It does.

1150
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,220
Yeah.

1151
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,100
As a matter of fact, I'm going to be,

1152
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,020
my butt's going to be sitting down watching it

1153
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,820
in two and a half hours.

1154
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,260
That's awesome.

1155
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,740
I will head out sometime over the break.

1156
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,540
You don't want to weigh in on the Reven controversy?

1157
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,500
No, no.

1158
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,570
All right, I get it.

1159
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,650
You want to play it safe.

1160
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,050
I do want to play it safe.

1161
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,730
We'll see what happens there.

1162
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,250
We are out of time.

1163
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,660
Anything else you want to cover here?

1164
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,220
No, we're good.

1165
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:46,580
All right, I hope you've enjoyed 2017 with A-B testing.

1166
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,780
I look forward to you hearing more of us in 2018

1167
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,260
and please email us tweets, Slack messages.

1168
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,580
Let us know what you want to hear about

1169
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,340
and we're always happy to share our opinions.

1170
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,780
Yep, and if you're in Europe,

1171
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,300
I don't think it's too late to go see Alan in Brighton.

1172
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,580
I'll be in Brighton in March, Test Bash.

1173
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,420
Yep.

1174
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,340
Free plug.

1175
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,100
All right, I am the Alan part of A-B testing.

1176
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,580
And I am not.

1177
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,180
All right, we'll see you next time.
