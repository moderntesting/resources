1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
So it depends on which challenge you want.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,960
They're both hard.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,040
They're both fulfilling.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,200
It really depends on which challenge you want, given the context of the team and the product.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,980
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,700
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,940
leadership, agile and anything else that comes to mind.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,700
Now on with the show.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,260
Hey, everyone.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,780
I'm Angry Weasel.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,020
And I'm Colonel Stinky Bottom.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,140
To the Weasel and Bottom podcast.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,580
Weasel and Stinky podcast.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,500
Oh, I should get stinky weasel dot com.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,060
Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,300
So the reason I bring that up and you can go to angry weasel dot com and see the history

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,500
behind Angry Weasel.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,300
When we're logged into Zencaster, which is working for now,

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,320
we have to put in a username and mine is I logged in as Angry Weasel and Brent

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,360
logged in while he cleans his room while I talk as Colonel Stinky Bottom.

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,280
So could you, um, the story of Angry Weasel is well known on the internet.

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,720
Could you please tell the internet, the story of Colonel Stinky Bottom?

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,840
Actually, it came from my roommate in college.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,200
He and I played a game and he actually went by general Stinky Bottom.

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,160
And I thought that was the funniest game playing handle.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,200
So college kids do dumb things.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,320
And I can tell you because my daughter is gone, left the state, practically left the

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,280
country. She has moved into her dorm.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,960
So far, she hasn't done dumb things, but I'm going to say it's inevitable.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,000
That just started, right?

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,920
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,240
She starts school on the sixth.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,480
She was able to move in a day early.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,160
So she moved in yesterday, but she's kind of getting unpacked.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,000
And I don't know where she's going to fit all her crap because as I told you, not

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,600
only is she moving out, we're boarding up this house and getting out of it.

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,360
So she's like, everything gone.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,960
No, the fact that I'm in a weird audio config today, it's essentially, I'm

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,880
hearing myself, but sometimes I'm like a three to five second delay.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,840
Oh, well, you're going to have to figure that out.

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,120
Milliseconds.

42
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,990
Both are annoying.

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,430
Yeah.

44
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,870
Brent has like one speaker that's working on one computer and one

45
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,790
microphone working on the other computer.

46
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,230
It's confusing.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,070
And somehow Zencaster is handling it.

48
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,830
This is our last podcast from from this room.

49
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,210
I am moving on the 11th.

50
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,890
And then after that, I'm on the 14th.

51
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,730
I'm going to leave and go do the Wonderland Trail.

52
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,610
So we'll figure it out.

53
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,170
We'll figure out.

54
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,250
Maybe we'll do one next week.

55
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,530
I don't know what's going on.

56
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,490
It's the A.B.

57
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,570
Testing podcast.

58
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,610
You haven't figured it out.

59
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:59,610
My AKA angry weasel Allen and he is AKA Colonel Stinky Bottom Brent.

60
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,490
And we're going to do a podcast where we talk about random stuff and hope that we

61
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,970
make sense to at least one of our three listeners.

62
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,610
So like a plan to you, Brent.

63
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,690
It does.

64
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,290
All right.

65
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,850
I have the first topic.

66
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,850
You do.

67
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,690
I do.

68
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,170
You do.

69
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,210
It's now Brent topic one.

70
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,970
Go.

71
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,690
Okay.

72
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,080
Do you know what this is?

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,520
That is a box.

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,440
It is a box.

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,920
It is an X box.

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,600
I don't know which camera it's an X box, man.

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,560
It is a box with an X box.

78
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,120
Correct.

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,600
In a box and Xbox X.

80
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,240
I have an Xbox X.

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Do you?

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,800
I do.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,420
I do, too.

84
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,820
Yeah, I got one in a while back.

85
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,740
A little while because because Starfield that came out.

86
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,940
Yesterday.

87
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,140
Oh, it did just for the pre-release.

88
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,460
Right.

89
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,260
For everyone.

90
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,140
Yes.

91
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,180
But if you are an ultimate game, I am, I am, but I have a problem.

92
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:09,860
And you bought the premium upgrade and you have one of these and you were

93
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,260
a friend of mine.

94
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:18,740
You can call me last night and tell me how awesome the game is.

95
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,300
All right.

96
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,820
I can't.

97
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,260
I can't.

98
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,180
So we have my daughter left, but we do have two teenagers living in our house

99
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,540
right now, long story, and they're living in the room with the Xbox.

100
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,140
So I have it.

101
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,540
I'm not able to play the Xbox for just a little bit longer.

102
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,660
Move the next box.

103
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,660
I got to pack my freaking house.

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,500
I'm going to get to it.

105
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,980
I'm going to get to Starfield about a month after you.

106
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,100
So you can ask me.

107
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,340
So it better live up to one half of the hype.

108
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
So that's all I can say.

109
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,300
If it is half as good as being hyped, I'll be happy.

110
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,220
But I'm worried.

111
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm actually worried that the amount of hype makes me think it's going to suck

112
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,260
and nothing would make me sadder.

113
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,660
It's advertised as made by the Alan makers of Alan's two favorite games of all time.

114
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,100
Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

115
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,540
I was like, yes, yes.

116
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,340
Give me, give me, give me.

117
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,500
If it sucks, I am going to go off.

118
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,860
There's no way there is.

119
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,820
Did you play Fallout 76?

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,300
There's a way I did.

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,140
And I did twice.

122
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,580
And I will tell you the first time it does suck it.

123
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,460
But the second time I've completed all of the missions.

124
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,420
I was amused by the game.

125
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,660
But now I'm just sort of wandering around upgrading my house.

126
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,100
Like, all right, cool.

127
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,860
I'm not as much into the crafting part.

128
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,340
So I like to fall out for.

129
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,420
Hey, so should we talk about our mailbag questions or other stuff we got to discuss?

130
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,580
What's going on, man? What's the plan?

131
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,140
Do we have a plan?

132
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,140
Yeah, let's do the agenda.

133
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,540
Let's go. We got two mailbag questions.

134
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,550
Mailbag.

135
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,990
And the question is, it's from Aaron.

136
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,750
Aaron Flynn, thank you for being one of the three in our Slack group.

137
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,590
And if you would like to be one of the three, you can go to modern testing.

138
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,220
Org and find the link to join our Slack group.

139
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,940
And if the link doesn't work, you can send me an email.

140
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,580
The address is on there and you can get me to fix it, which I just did this week.

141
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,820
All right. But Aaron asks, I'm interested in the circumstances or reasons people

142
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,500
made a transition from I see to non I see roles.

143
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,220
I see being individual contributor, a non I see, a K.A. a manager.

144
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,740
What makes you go back and forth?

145
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,820
This is editorial comment.

146
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,460
He didn't write this.

147
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,300
He's better at English than I am.

148
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,300
What are reasons for going back and forth between being a manager and a non manager?

149
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,300
What made you do it?

150
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,340
When do you encourage people you manage?

151
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,060
Since I read the question, I'm going to let you I have a I just want to keep on

152
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,540
talking for like 20 minutes on this, but I think it would be better if we got your

153
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,300
insights first, Mr. Stinky Bottom.

154
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,060
Do we think that's the question he meant to ask?

155
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,900
When do you encourage people you manage?

156
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,260
Well, I'm going to switch it like, well, it is about like I'm going to talk about

157
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,300
that, like when people should when I encourage people on my team to become

158
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,100
managers or not.

159
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,300
But I want to tell my stories about going back and forth.

160
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,300
Oh, do you think that's what it was?

161
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,900
Because I'm reading it literally.

162
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,900
When do you encourage the people you're

163
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,250
a manager like all the time?

164
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,250
No, no, no.

165
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,450
It's about making the switch.

166
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,450
How do you coach people on when to do it?

167
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,050
How do you choose when to do it?

168
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,850
And even if that's not the question, this is the question we're going to answer

169
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,650
because this is the better question.

170
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,450
Okay.

171
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:56,780
I have always been promoted to manager literally every job I've had, even including

172
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,780
when I started at 16 and Carl's Junior flipping burgers.

173
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:09,380
For me, it's the work ethic that kind of always brings me there.

174
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Managers.

175
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,580
Because I see don't work hard or have a good work ethic.

176
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm going to let you finish.

177
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,860
No, but I have some comments.

178
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,460
They do.

179
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:30,860
It's just I've always been in a position where I was in the upper runs as an IC.

180
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,860
Right.

181
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:38,860
It's like I'm here to do the right thing, make customers happy, etc.

182
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,660
Try to bounce stuff on your desk while you're talking because I can't edit

183
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,060
that out.

184
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,660
I believe you're selling yourself short.

185
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,840
Please continue.

186
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,640
Think you bottom.

187
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:58,640
I was always someone who is striving towards perfection as in terms of how I

188
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,440
was being judged.

189
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,240
It since has been revealed to me through my counselor.

190
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,840
This is this is one of the aspects of how I grew up.

191
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,670
And that's all the detail.

192
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,070
I'm going to go on the podcast, but not great.

193
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,470
So what you're saying is your environment growing up has led you to wanting to be

194
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,270
and being more comfortable in managerial roles.

195
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,470
We'll do that.

196
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,470
You will do that.

197
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,070
Okay.

198
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,870
Summarize.

199
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,070
It's one of my powers.

200
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,270
When I look at my strengths, we've talked about strength finders stuff on here.

201
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,270
Right.

202
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:50,870
I'm really good at seeing what makes each individual really special and helping

203
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:59,270
them to carve the Michelangelo out of their own marble columns.

204
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,270
Cool.

205
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:08,070
Early on, it was just because sometime around 20 years ago, what I was

206
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,070
about five years into my career, there's a bit of wisdom that I realized as a

207
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,870
manager, no one's ever going to remember the projects we worked on and what we

208
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,070
shipped the tech, although that's not entirely true, unexpectedly.

209
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,870
Perseus, as we've talked about before, is still in use.

210
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:36,260
And surprisingly, that thing we built in 1996.

211
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,260
How you how you treat your employees, the employees that love you and the ones that

212
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,660
hate you, they're going to remember you forever.

213
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,150
And I think about that legacy and I'm kind of blending into the second question.

214
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,550
Well, let's not get there because I had a whole bunch of rebuttal and questions

215
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,950
for you for our first question.

216
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,750
Sure.

217
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,150
Are you ready for me?

218
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,150
Yes.

219
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:08,750
So I want to go all the way back to one thing you said and be very clear on it.

220
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,350
Yes.

221
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,750
And that thing is you mentioned being promoted into management, which I don't

222
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,750
like that terminology because it's not a promotion.

223
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,750
I'm sure at some companies when you move into management, you absolutely did.

224
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,750
And I will now elevate the volume on you saying that and editing because I can.

225
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:35,750
I have always been promoted to manager, been promoted, been promoted, been promoted.

226
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,150
It is a career change.

227
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,950
It's a different job moved into management.

228
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,550
Yes.

229
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,550
So let me tell you a little bit about what I've done.

230
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,550
I have gone my entire career bouncing between an IC and a manager and for a

231
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,150
reason and for good reasons every time I talk about those.

232
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,750
One thing really cool is on our Slack group merit has done the same thing.

233
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,150
She has bounced back and forth between being an IC and being a manager.

234
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,750
Some of its contextual and not everybody can do that.

235
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,950
But let me talk about my reasons and see if they help Aaron at all and

236
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,550
understanding.

237
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,150
So I started at Microsoft as an IC 95.

238
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,150
Here's how I became a manager at Microsoft for the first time.

239
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:24,390
I was working on Windows and it was a

240
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,390
I call Windows ME Windows marketing edition because it was really about

241
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,590
having a ship vehicle for a whole bunch of applications.

242
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,190
So it was a small team and they kind of just put something together.

243
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,990
Pretty small team doing an OS.

244
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,180
We did some I don't want to go into all the details what we did, but I was

245
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,380
working on debugging the nightly stress runs working on the kernel and working

246
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:56,470
on enhancing and debugging the debug version of Windows and I was

247
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,470
underwater like one of the only times in my life I've gone to my manager

248
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,670
said I'm having a hard time getting all this done.

249
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,870
There's lots of context switching cognitive load and he says, hey, I think

250
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,870
we have a new hire starting next week.

251
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,070
Let's have them work for you.

252
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,270
And I said great.

253
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,270
I have someone to delegate crap to and so I had a direct report.

254
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,560
And he came in.

255
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,960
He's so funny.

256
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,360
I won't call Yawn out by name shit, but he overslept his first day and showed

257
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:29,960
up around noon.

258
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,760
It was hilarious.

259
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,160
This is what he felt so horrible.

260
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,760
But it was so funny.

261
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,360
I didn't care.

262
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
Anyway, Yawn helped me out a lot and they ended up sliding a few more

263
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,560
people into my org for for consistency, the people who ran stress, etc.

264
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,360
So I had a small org after that piece of crap shipped.

265
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,760
I worked over on Windows CE where they grew a larger team around me

266
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,560
because I knew a lot how Colonel and drivers work.

267
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,560
They put all the testers Estet's in charge of tool development,

268
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,360
driver development, kernel development, all of my org.

269
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,560
The name of graphics over and before I knew it, I had this team of

270
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
about 50 people.

271
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,760
I was very much and here's probably where I made my first mistake.

272
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
My learning as a manager.

273
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I had crappy mentoring as a manager.

274
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,960
I think Microsoft didn't really care as much about managing people

275
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,260
just having people on teams at the time and I was so hands-off today.

276
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,060
My philosophy is give people a framework they can work in and then

277
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,860
get out of their way.

278
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,260
I didn't really give my team a framework.

279
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,460
Fortunately, I had a lot of really good performers on the team and

280
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,160
the team got a lot of crap done.

281
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,860
But then I just didn't like it at the time.

282
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Part of it was I thought the whole I mentioned just mentioned

283
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,560
a minute ago at a team that was performing really well, but we

284
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,260
had the whole stack ranking thing going on which I thought was

285
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,060
dumb and I have to go into these meetings twice a year and go

286
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,260
here's my lowest performer.

287
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,160
Here's what they're doing.

288
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Tell me I'm going to give them a 2.5.

289
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,460
So yeah, we'll do the hand wave and we'll figure something

290
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,360
out. Maybe they get to three.

291
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
I said bullshit.

292
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,390
So I just didn't like the way Microsoft made you manage people

293
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,490
about the same time.

294
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,590
Thoma invented this test architect role and my manager said

295
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,790
well, you should be a test architect.

296
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,290
I said, okay.

297
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,090
I don't know what that is.

298
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,190
And so I jettisoned everyone except for the tool development

299
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,090
team at first and eventually jettisoned everyone else back

300
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,690
to an IC.

301
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,290
So I turned to that time.

302
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,690
It's sort of the IC that's the right hand person if whoever

303
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,790
is in charge of stuff and I love that role.

304
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,190
I have someone who works for me in that role now and it's

305
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,590
great.

306
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,990
I love doing that.

307
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,490
I did that.

308
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,490
I went over to the engine XO thing and whatever and did

309
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,490
that for a link.

310
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:37,990
I left there.

311
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,890
I went over and did that for Xbox.

312
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,990
I worked as a IC reporting to our whatever Chris was director.

313
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,680
He wasn't a VP.

314
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,080
He was a partner director, but I just figured out what needed

315
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,780
to get done and did it.

316
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,980
I've always enjoyed influencing without authority and helping

317
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,180
people.

318
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,380
I've never had a problem with that.

319
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,180
I have no problem having an opinion and helping people get

320
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,880
stuff done and I did not like how Microsoft wanted managers

321
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,480
to behave.

322
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,880
I had studied enough at that point about management.

323
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,380
I got into studying management a lot when I argued with our

324
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,480
learning and development team over the differences between

325
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
leadership and management.

326
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,580
I said a lot of things you're teaching managers are good

327
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
for people in leadership positions.

328
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,680
So their answer to that was to send me to a bunch of our

329
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,480
management training.

330
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,780
And so I learned a lot there.

331
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,180
This is where I started reading so many damn books about

332
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
leadership and management.

333
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,780
I stuck with an IC when I joined Chris's team on Xbox.

334
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,780
I was offered a role of running the tools team for Xbox

335
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,640
and I said that noise because not only did I not really

336
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,140
want to be a manager at Microsoft, but I had been around

337
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,540
a long enough to know that folks who worked on internal tools

338
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,040
got shafted in reviews across the board.

339
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,340
So there's just no way I said, you know what put me in

340
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,940
charge of it.

341
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,540
Don't give me any direct reports.

342
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,640
We're going to run the whole damn thing like a virtual

343
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,840
team open source and and we did and I wrote more code

344
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,640
in those two years.

345
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,940
Like my joke always is my two years on Xbox one were the

346
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,740
best five years of my career and weed and a bunch of

347
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,140
that stuff still being used as well.

348
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,740
Not like famous like the Perseus test case management

349
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,240
system after Xbox one shipped.

350
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
I worked on that stupid science project for a while

351
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
still as an IC doing whatever I wanted.

352
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,240
I went over to teams as an IC at first and then eventually

353
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,240
grew a team around me and that's where those things

354
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,740
were a little better than the Satya effect was coming

355
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,140
around and it was a little easier to be a manager.

356
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,840
They weren't making us do dumb things.

357
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,040
I found with all my experience influence that authority

358
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,840
and with like the things we talked about on the podcast

359
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,140
and studying agile and agile leadership.

360
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,440
I felt pretty good about it.

361
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,940
I enjoyed management.

362
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,140
In fact, I think I remember at the time we're around

363
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,740
then talking to you and go hey man, should I go

364
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,840
back into a management role?

365
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,440
And you're so in your hell.

366
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Yeah, you do it.

367
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,040
You may not remember that I do know I do.

368
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,540
I totally remember it and and probably over over lunch

369
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,440
at that Vietnamese place, but or somewhere.

370
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,640
Anyway, no, no, no, I do remember it because it was also

371
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,840
the same time we went to I went to Din Tai Fung

372
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,640
for the first time and like everything about like

373
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,140
Din Tai Fung friggin fantastic.

374
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,640
Oh, no doubt.

375
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,340
And that was my first time and I remember everything

376
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,840
about that.

377
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,940
I if I knew the Japanese names, I think I could tell

378
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,440
you what you ate let alone what I ate.

379
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,640
Yeah, Din Tai Fung is Chinese.

380
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,540
Yes, I know.

381
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,740
I realize that I was dumbass again.

382
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,640
Yeah, I remember that and I also remember you were like

383
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,840
the team you were leaving was not great.

384
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,280
Much of what you were saying kind of resonates like one

385
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,080
of the things I realized as you were talking about you

386
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,380
switching back before between a manager and an IC is

387
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,880
kind of what I do between M1 and M2.

388
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,080
I often get pushed into M2 is kind of kind of what I think

389
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,180
is on track right now in my job.

390
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,680
And what's interesting is I love that I have grown to

391
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
love that M2 role.

392
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
Why how to teach me?

393
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,680
I immediately miss being useful.

394
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,980
I get a lot out of helping leaders become better leaders.

395
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,480
It's really motivating for me in the five levels of leadership

396
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,280
by Maxwell.

397
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
He talks about and I love this the levels in the book.

398
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
Some of the book is a little weird but talks about you're

399
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,980
putting a position of leadership and then people give

400
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,580
you permission to lead them as a gift to build trust on

401
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,080
that team.

402
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,780
But eventually your job is to build more leaders in the

403
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,280
org and I like that.

404
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,280
I do not want to manage the details of what my team is doing.

405
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,680
I very much want to help go back to Legione.

406
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
I'm a galvanizer and a discerner.

407
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,080
I'm going to help them figure out what is the right thing

408
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,680
to work on?

409
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
What is the direction?

410
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,180
Let me put a nice framework around what you need to get

411
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,080
done and then let you ride your bike and I'll watch

412
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,780
from the edge of the cul-de-sac and see how you do.

413
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,680
You can ask me for questions, but I really like helping

414
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,080
people become better leaders.

415
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm a very good leader in the business.

416
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,030
It is what I will do for the rest of my career.

417
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,530
I'm managing a much smaller team at NBC that did a

418
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,630
previous job, but I'm still managing a group of leaders.

419
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,130
I have my right hand I see and three other director

420
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,630
plus level folks and my job is to give them a framework

421
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,430
where they can be successful and coach them.

422
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,230
I just went through the just very quickly the five

423
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,030
levels of leadership.

424
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,630
I got to imagine this is something you talked about

425
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,630
before but I'm looking at it now and I'm like, I don't

426
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,030
remember ever thinking the thoughts I'm currently

427
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,530
thinking.

428
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:06,730
Right.

429
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,930
These five levels is fantastic.

430
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,830
I wonder does the book go through and and argue why

431
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,730
that's the leveling very much so.

432
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,430
Okay, Amazon.com.

433
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,930
Yeah, so let me go ahead and finish my story because

434
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,530
I kept on bouncing around.

435
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,630
I went to unity as a manager direct and as we discussed

436
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,130
on here and as I've done many times in my career, I

437
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,930
worked myself out of a job.

438
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,930
I got to a point where I had moved all of my team into

439
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,730
either quality coach roles into Dev roles into DevOps

440
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,030
roles platform engineering whatever you want to call

441
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,230
them and all of a sudden I was an IC without a team.

442
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,330
So I went over if you recall and worked as an IC on

443
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,730
our ad system running program management, which was

444
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,230
a good learning experience for me and I learned a

445
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,030
whole crap ton about delivery in just having an

446
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,230
opinion there moving forward that I still apply

447
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,530
when I went back to leadership.

448
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,330
So I I am comfortable but I am comfortable being an

449
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,330
IC who tries to influence hundreds or thousands of

450
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,030
employees as I am leading a team of 50 100 200 500.

451
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,130
I am beyond the point in my career where writing code

452
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,530
all day is going to be my job or even where writing

453
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,530
code half the day is going to be my job.

454
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,630
I miss it, but I'm just not as good at it as my

455
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,130
employees are but I feel like I am I enjoy it and

456
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,330
I feel like I do a good job influencing and leading

457
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,530
large numbers of people with a M and IC or a manager.

458
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,230
So will you comment on that?

459
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,030
I'm gonna go back to the whole like how do I

460
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,930
make that choice?

461
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,130
I'm thinking yeah, you're right on for me.

462
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,730
I know I and I'm wondering if that's one of the

463
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,530
if that's my next thing right now, right?

464
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,830
Similar to you your career since you and I've

465
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,630
met you've kind of changed what you do and how

466
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:14,030
you're doing it every two to three years if not faster,

467
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,730
right?

468
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,730
I used to argue through on that but you're exactly

469
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,030
right.

470
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,530
You did and then I think I don't know.

471
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,630
I feel like I may have pointed out the pattern

472
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,730
because I remember one time you did try to argue

473
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,330
with me and I'm like dude, I know I take it back.

474
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,030
I was wrong.

475
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,630
I'm like it's on fucking LinkedIn.

476
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,930
Let's go look right now.

477
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,730
Yeah, I'm thinking I really still get a lot of

478
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,830
joy. It's not so much of the coding stuff as much

479
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,730
anymore. I'm spending a lot more time focus on

480
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,330
teaching my my employees.

481
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,430
It's almost out of self-defense.

482
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,730
I run a team of data scientists and very very

483
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,630
clearly the trend is that a science is going to

484
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,330
be a specialization in death.

485
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,430
It's it's absolutely clearly a trend in my mind

486
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,330
that's ever increasing and so I'm like, okay,

487
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,130
these guys got a code and I don't think a single

488
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,530
person other than me on my team really has a good

489
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,730
sense for example of design patterns or TDD or any

490
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,830
of these sort of modern development principles.

491
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,730
That's not true.

492
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,230
Actually, I have two people one has a one was

493
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,630
trained collegiately as a CS right up to Masters,

494
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,230
but the other one has has industry.

495
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,430
I mean your story makes sense.

496
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,530
Do we use that you have more things to go?

497
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,930
Oh, I think that was I just saw how I make the

498
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,630
choices. You know, I don't think I'm going back

499
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,030
to being an IC and it really if I go back to

500
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,560
the points where I've made that choice, it's

501
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,060
taking the opportunities where I thought I could

502
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,860
learn the most and being a manager isn't for

503
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,360
everyone. In fact, one of the things I do I did

504
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,060
this at Unity.

505
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,060
I'm doing it right now in my current job is when

506
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,360
someone wants to be a lead like someone thinks

507
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
I'm thinking of going into management and in my

508
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,960
head first off a conversation with them and I'll

509
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,260
explain to him that's a career change and by

510
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,460
the way Camille Fornier's book called The

511
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,060
Manager's Path excellent walkthrough on how

512
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,260
like she's really thought through this.

513
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,160
I think it's an excellent book.

514
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm a big fan of hers, but I have a conversation

515
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,620
with them first to figure out like this is a

516
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,920
career change is different.

517
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,020
It's not a promotion.

518
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,920
It's not easier.

519
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,020
It's just different.

520
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,820
It's a different job and if they tell me yeah,

521
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,720
I want to try it.

522
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,720
I make them a provisional lead which means that

523
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,620
they I don't move the people over but they act

524
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,820
like the lead of the team and they and they

525
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,220
function as the manager.

526
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,320
I treat them as a manager.

527
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,120
They're invited to my leadership meetings and

528
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,520
I like to do that for about three months and

529
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,420
what happens in that time is they figure out if

530
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,520
management's for them and I will tell you 25%

531
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,720
of the time maybe a little less 20 to 25%

532
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
of the time people have gone through those

533
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,020
three months and said you know what this was

534
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,320
fun, but I'd like to go back to being in I see

535
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,650
and because it is a dip.

536
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,550
It's a career change and I want to give people

537
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,550
the opportunity to try it in a safe environment.

538
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,750
And if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

539
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,050
No, no feelings lost.

540
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,450
They got a chance to do it in a safe environment.

541
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,850
Lesson learned.

542
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,450
How did you bootstrap that that sort of process

543
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,150
within your team like the first time.

544
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,750
Hey, this person is going to be an active manager

545
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,350
without any reports like how do they learn how

546
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,950
to manage in that regard?

547
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,350
Well, I talk about with the team about what

548
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,250
the provisional lead role is like.

549
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,450
I say I explain this is anything I explained

550
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,150
to you to the team.

551
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,750
When we have opportunities for someone to move

552
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,950
into a lead position and someone's interested.

553
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,650
I explained that will put them in this provisional

554
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,050
role. I explain what it means.

555
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,450
It means they're going to manage the team.

556
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,850
We're not going to we're not going to make the

557
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,450
HR changes, but we're going to have them manage

558
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,650
the team for around three months.

559
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,750
I like from two both sides to try before you

560
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,650
buy it's a very safe way to do that.

561
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,050
I don't know how it is.

562
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,250
I know since the big flattening at Microsoft

563
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,250
is all these people that were had been leads

564
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,550
forever. All of a sudden weren't leads and when

565
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,450
I would open a lead position, I would get 10,000

566
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,750
internal applicants for that position, but I had

567
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,650
an opposite challenge on my previous team where

568
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,050
I don't know enough yet about the current team

569
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,850
where people did not want to be leads.

570
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,850
They thought that seems hard.

571
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,250
I don't want to do that versus all that seems

572
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,250
easy. I want to do that, but I want to give

573
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,850
them the opportunity to do it in a way.

574
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,750
That's not scary.

575
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,250
I just talk about it.

576
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,050
I socialize it.

577
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,650
I like that strategy in some regards.

578
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,050
I'm kind of doing this more informally with

579
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,250
with my team.

580
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,350
I have two IC level principles on my team

581
00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:00,880
and I really want them to understand business

582
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,180
leadership in my organization is something

583
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,380
that I believe for a very long time.

584
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,980
I do know my senior VP agrees with me on this

585
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,380
principle level.

586
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:19,080
I sees they need to be more owning a small part

587
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,380
of the whole business like they own the KPI.

588
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:22,980
They got to move.

589
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,280
They own the strategy to get there.

590
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,380
They own that business and it's a real struggle

591
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,980
for people going from senior to to principle

592
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,480
right because they what do you mean?

593
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,580
What got me here isn't going to get me there.

594
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,380
Did you have a difficulty making that shift?

595
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,380
I know I did.

596
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,280
I said at 64 for I think seven years because

597
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,180
I was just like and then I realized I went and

598
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,180
actually talked to the right set of people and

599
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,780
they're like there's no such thing as as a level

600
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:03,380
60 at that point a level 65 test architect.

601
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,880
That was sort of what they were saying.

602
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,980
Now, I know that got to be true, but they're like

603
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,680
they may have that title, but they're a business owner.

604
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,810
They're not just the next level up test architect type

605
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,610
book and for non-Microsoft people that's sort of

606
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,810
that where the principle level begins the principle

607
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,510
engineer. Yeah, it was really hard at that time.

608
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,410
I think it's important to a lot at that level.

609
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,010
It's important to align yourself with a manager

610
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,210
who understands what should come out of that role.

611
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,210
I think it's important as a principal engineer 65

612
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,510
plus for Microsoft folks to have an opinion that

613
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,110
matters that you can sell.

614
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,110
I guess the big difference like at 64 you could

615
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,610
just crank out really good work all day, but at

616
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:52,110
65 plus you're expected to be an influencer and

617
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:56,510
and help drive big things and get them done, which

618
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,710
I enjoyed so I probably I must have been I don't

619
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,110
really remember when I got promoted 65.

620
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,910
I know I think I was still in Windows CE.

621
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,510
I was because I think I made it to 66 in Windows

622
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,110
CE the mid-principal level and eventually got to 67

623
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,110
when I worked in engineering excellence.

624
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,310
The short answer is and we're not going to get

625
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,410
to the second mailbag question, but the short

626
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:25,010
answer is to I see your manager is I would say

627
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,100
understand that it's a career change and be in

628
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,400
the place where you can both learn the most and

629
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,000
have the most impact and I honestly be engaged

630
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,400
the most I wouldn't take a manager position just

631
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
to take a manager position if I didn't want to do

632
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,300
it. If I didn't care about growing people and

633
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,800
increasing engagement to me, I think the most

634
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,400
important thing a manager can do is drive engagement

635
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,100
for their team, which means building a healthy

636
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,100
org, which means autonomy mastery and purpose make

637
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,600
sure people understand that they're what they're

638
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,400
doing and why it's important have the skills in

639
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,100
order to do that and the autonomy in the framework

640
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
they can work in and then get their work done as

641
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,400
a manager. You want to build that culture for your

642
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,800
team to be successful. This is true for a line

643
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,300
manager as well as a manager and managers take

644
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,500
that management role. If you want to not have the

645
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,600
burden of that and get a bunch of stuff done

646
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,800
that impacts maybe even a larger part of the orgs,

647
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,100
I think those high-level ICS can often or I think

648
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,300
65 plus going back to principal engineers.

649
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,600
They're having influence not only in their

650
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,900
manager's org, but in their manager's peers

651
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,700
organization. So it depends on which challenge

652
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,100
you want. They're both hard. They're both

653
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,600
fulfilling. It really depends on which challenge

654
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,500
you want given the context of the team in the

655
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,900
product completely. I mean, I think the trick

656
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,200
is take on the one that's more important and

657
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,400
then train up your people and have them help

658
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,000
you shoulder the burden on the other. Yes. Work

659
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,400
yourself out of a job. Yes. We've said that

660
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,800
mission repeatedly on the cast and I will say

661
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,100
it is still the right thing. Absolutely. And did

662
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,700
you see my my sub stack post like two weeks ago?

663
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,300
What was the title? I don't know some Taylor

664
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,400
Swift song. I read something recently. I don't

665
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,600
know if it's the one. Why don't you make the

666
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,000
it was a real story about us talking to someone

667
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,500
who were talking to their husband and their

668
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,200
husband said they couldn't take a vacation

669
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,700
because their team needed them. Oh, I did read

670
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,100
that one. And that's a true story that made me

671
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,000
think so much like that is absolutely wrong. So

672
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,200
every manager I've ever worked for I've all I've

673
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,500
taken a bit of their style and made it part of

674
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,500
my own right. The bad managers like the thing

675
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
I took it from the from their style is like,

676
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,350
yeah, I am never going to do that. But there

677
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,150
was one manager that told me early on in my

678
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,550
career that at Microsoft there is never a good

679
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,850
time to take a vacation. Therefore any time is

680
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,550
just as good. I think that's true for any job.

681
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,750
Yeah. And we need to learn from Europe. I don't

682
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,150
care what's going on. I'm gone for four weeks.

683
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,950
I don't know if that's we need to learn. It's

684
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,850
tough for Merk tough for Americans. No. So one

685
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,450
of the issues one of the issues that contradicts

686
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,150
that which is there's still like at Microsoft

687
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,550
and I don't know how how wide it is. There's

688
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:30,850
still this sort of emphasis around specialists.

689
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:35,750
Hey Alan, what's your project right. And I'm

690
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,250
like yeah I don't want Alan to own a project

691
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,550
and I certainly do not want my manager talking

692
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,350
to him about the project he owns because that

693
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,650
contradicts the T shape people I'm trying

694
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,950
to build in this organization. But with that

695
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:58,550
with that sort of ownership model it has a we've

696
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,350
talked about this a million times. Right. A

697
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,850
specialist is on this podcast is known as

698
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,450
what a bottleneck. Right. Right. And you know

699
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,250
what you may not actually your team may not

700
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,150
actually need you or may actually need you

701
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,650
if you're a manager I'm going to just straight

702
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,650
up tell you if your team needs you you're up.

703
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,820
Yeah. Now it may be situational like there are

704
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,820
times where that happens but I sure as hell

705
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,020
hope that you are as Alan said I think like

706
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,720
six times on the podcast working yourself out

707
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,920
of a job one million percent. All right with

708
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
that violent agreement I think there are some

709
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,620
chunks in there that maybe someone finds

710
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,920
valuable we'll find out let us know. Yeah let

711
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,720
us know could join our slack community give us

712
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,820
high ratings tell people listen to the podcast

713
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,820
send us we don't need any money. Send us don't

714
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,420

715
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,820
there. I am angry weasel Alan and I'm I'm just

716
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,520
