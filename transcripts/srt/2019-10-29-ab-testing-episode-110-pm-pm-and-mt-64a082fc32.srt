00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:22,340
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show we're back hey right how's

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,490
it going?

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:42,410
How you been? Overworked under exciting yes I did a big presentation to Scott Guthrie

6
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:52,430
I've heard of that man since we last talked and he is now referring

7
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,190
other teams to me by name I'm not certain if it's good or bad that Scott

8
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,190
Guthrie knows my name. Brent a mover and a shaker on his way up. I'm definitely

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,350
moving and shaking things but now I've got teams coming to me at a at a rate

10
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:20,920
around three teams per employee on my team so I have a I have a scale problem

11
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:31,580
coming very quickly. Well the trick to that is just say no Nancy Reagan. I was

12
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:41,130
just gonna say no. You don't like the Nancy Reagan add-on? No I don't. So anyway

13
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,440
so it's exciting times I will figure out a way to scale don't know how yet but I

14
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,830
have confidence that my background thinker processor will some at some

15
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,670
moment at 3 a.m. over the next week will wake me up and go this is the

16
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,850
answer and I'll go oh thank you background processor I will execute that

17
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:11,120
immediately how about you you've been traveling I did a quick trip to Montreal

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,140
I left on Sunday came back Wednesday night got up early for my Thursday

19
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,020
morning meeting luckily got lots of sleep last night so yeah yeah a little

20
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,800
quick trip to Montreal I'm home for two weeks then I am off to Sweden to wait

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:39,880
Norway Sweden we think Sweden I am I am less geographically challenged than most

22
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,240
Americans I'm just stupid so yeah I'm off to Sweden to give a talk on

23
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,610
reflections on modern testing so the point of that talk is a a brief little

24
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,210
intro to modern testing and then I want to share some stories from some people

25
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,050
that have done some modern testing like things in the world we'll talk about

26
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,650
what's next should be fun I will share slides once I complete them on our one

27
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,390
of the three dot slack comm so that's exciting I also recently if you're

28
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,050
listening to this and listen to our feed you go what the hell is this weird new

29
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:21,450
age jazz stuff and Alan just talking kicked off the intro episode of the ABT

30
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,250
three-for-three podcast which is a will be a sporadic but interesting and

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,210
shorter version of a testing because there's no Brent there's just Alan

32
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:36,610
talking to members of the three members of the community I have one show ready

33
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,930
to post probably go out next week I have another one recorded just needs some

34
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,490
editing and a few others lined up to record so those should be fun they're

35
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:49,730
all about 20 minutes long just a brief little peek into a slice of life and

36
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,610
people doing things that are modern testing like you have one released I

37
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:04,680
just the intro you release the okay so that's coming up and that's it that's my

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,320
travel for the end of the year and then I'm going to London for like eight days

39
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,110
in eight or nine days in January cool and that's as far ahead as I can think

40
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:23,320
so that's what's going on with me where I haven't turned around where are we

41
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,200
starting on today's podcast journey I would start you want to start with the

42
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,780
letter or do you want to start with oh it might go into that so let me give some

43
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,020
context here yeah it's not really a letter I guess it's I thinking mailbag

44
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,280
but it's not a mailbag it was a slack message and I need to give some

45
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,660
context all of our mailbags are slack messages oh you're right you're right

46
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,300
this is the different one so this is gonna take a while to work into you

47
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,380
correct me where I veer off course or I'm wrong so most of you know I work at

48
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,100
Unity I recently six months ago changed jobs away from being a director of QA I

49
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,380
became that ever tell you my title it's stupid I wanted to be director of

50
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,620
delivery so back that's what I do I make sure that we can deliver and the

51
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,060
way I describe it without saying accelerate the achievement of quality

52
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,580
because I say I help our organization about growing 200 plus engineers how to

53
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,340
balance quality and frequent releases and shipping faster how can we go faster

54
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,060
and with higher quality because those things balance each other out I think I

55
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,060
might have mentioned that on the podcast before I'll take a shot at tequila right

56
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,120
now hold on okay I'm back and that's what I do in the art my title is

57
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:50,460
director of program management which has a which is hard for me because at

58
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,700
Microsoft where I spent a big chunk of my life the program manager role is such

59
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,620
a bastardized bit of the remainder that's different from org to org and is

60
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,580
actually nothing like the program management I do now that it hurts a

61
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,700
little bit but I'm getting it I'm getting I'm getting past it are you

62
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:17,470
managing a program I'm managing all of our programs okay it seems like a

63
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,510
relevant title it's much more when I actually read books it's funny how often

64
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,110
you like do internet circuits on program management and you end up with project

65
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,630
management either a name or a description but what I've done some reading and

66
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,870
research on program management it's actually it's actually what I do I make

67
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,670
sure all of our programs execute it's very highly related to quality and

68
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:47,390
actually my full title is director of program management and quality so I

69
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,470
still have that keyword in there but anyway I still like director of delivery

70
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,390
they drive much better what I do but they wouldn't they wouldn't make up a

71
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:02,020
new title for me so a lot of syllables for essentially a release p.m. oh but it's

72
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,620
but it's much more than that we'll get to that later how does ship room go at

73
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:13,180
unity oh we don't have a ship why would how could you have a ship room I'm not

74
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:21,340
redoing the the old-school and actually versus new no but actually the

75
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,020
editor engine team does has something kind of like a ship room but when we're

76
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:33,080
shipping we have stuff shipping I mean we have 90 services that make up

77
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,320
monetization alone and those are shipping all the time yeah that's

78
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:45,590
actually an interesting criteria right in the old days just the existence of a

79
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:52,120
ship room was necessary because you need to get everyone together because the

80
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,780
decision to ship was a unanimous decision and also irreversible decision it

81
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,340
wasn't it was I mean for all intents and purposes yes it was irreversible it

82
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:14,780
would be extremely expensive and and as someone who holds accountability for

83
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:22,480
allowing a recall class bug to go out yeah I'm very sensitive to those type of

84
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:30,600
things I do think on as an aside shipping a recall class bug it's

85
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:38,230
something you have no choice to do but once but is a super valuable learning

86
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,430
lesson so here's an interesting stage where we're at I want to and we'll get to

87
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,510
a point here eventually we have we're talking about the SRE team earlier

88
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:52,430
before we started recording at Unity and we have incidents errors in

89
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:58,790
production something goes wrong we've had a few that were just oops bad code but

90
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,470
those really they happen but they're super rare right now what we have is the

91
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,950
flavor of error of oh wow it's actually I'll put it this way we have our errors

92
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,900
of complexity and what I call complexity or complexity due to integration

93
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,300
complexity dude like I make a change in this thing and then this unexpected

94
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,060
thing downstream does something unexpected based on that yeah so that

95
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,140
error of complexity we have a lot of those and we'll work on getting more

96
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,980
resilient towards those we have some errors because a third-party provider our

97
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,520
cloud platform for example may have an issue okay there's this course or stuff

98
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,080
with failover you can do there that would help their longer term and then

99
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,920
there are we had an interesting issue I don't know if I can go into it too

100
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,080
much but I'll put it this I can this way we had an interesting error took

101
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,400
us a while to track down we had one of our metrics was what we expected for

102
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,840
something we were we had rolled out to a small percentage of our of our users

103
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,880
and the metrics were off the monitoring like this something's weird here off as

104
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,160
in going in the wrong direction wrong direction wrong direction this something

105
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,320
it we had something we expected to be at a level when we rolled out to assert

106
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:30,230
to 10% and it was not at that level and it was well below it was not horrible but

107
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,670
there was something going on and we dug and we dug like we looked at our

108
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:41,260
community re-reviewed code undoing the change completely would not have been a

109
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:48,220
valid case because it was Jesus so hard to talk abstractly about anyway we

110
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,420
couldn't believe me we couldn't just undo the change we needed to figure out

111
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,620
why the change we made was causing problems lots of reviews of three etc etc

112
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,020
we found out that it was just a malicious player running some scripts

113
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:09,250
okay so your system wasn't flawed in any way or did well change the system was

114
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:18,410
flawed in that it was no no no there's something they didn't get anything but

115
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,360
the fact that they were trying caused our numbers to go off so it's that

116
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,400
anomaly detection which is as you know as a data scientist is a kind of a hard

117
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,510
thing no anomaly detection is not hard not all really yeah root causing the

118
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:44,230
source okay that's hard okay fair enough so anyway my role oh so getting

119
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,030
back on track as some of the three know I send a newsletter ease to my used to

120
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,630
be my team then it was my former team and then eventually I just called the

121
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,950
unit eventually turned to something we call the unity quality newsletter and I

122
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,950
send it to a whole bunch of people at unity and various people sign up

123
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:08,390
including my manager current current manus per at both okay so lots of

124
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,110
people read this thing I just sent one out interestingly about accelerate

125
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:18,870
okay and kind of going into the book the BS of the word okay just the word the

126
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,750
letter a is beautiful good it's also a stand for Alan not coincidentally stands

127
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:34,220
for shut the crap up so anyway I got a message from my boss I got your

128
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,110
newsletter great mail and then he said I have another idea for you for your

129
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,270
next news like great now he's giving me I'm paraphrasing this brunch actually

130
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,430
read the quote but I'm paraphrasing the the text he's a very eloquent speaker and

131
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:56,270
writer but and I hope it's this podcast but wait you said you hope he doesn't

132
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:02,790
okay I have nothing bad to say about it actually I don't and as you know I've

133
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:08,140
hated a lot of managers yeah well mostly my last one at Microsoft but

134
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,290
it's others is to you know you I will throw any names under the bus I thought

135
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:20,340
Chris I liked Chris the next box he was good anyway all right then so and this

136
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:27,780
ties into my program manager and quality role and everything else I do he says

137
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:34,380
blah blah blah imagine a quality imagine as a quality leader as you are as mean

138
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,540
of our maneuver lessons are if you got control of the program management

139
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,690
aspect of the organization which I have and made some changes Halloween I was

140
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,730
trying to what changes would you make and how would they be measured and

141
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,090
measured stuff but what changes would you make and how would they be measured

142
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,420
and then there they says in your experience in this role what have you

143
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,900
learned about having that control of the activity of a product organization so

144
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,020
far and what matters but that first half I think is kind of interesting I'm

145
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,300
gonna throw to you and I'd love to throw to the listeners as well but as someone

146
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,420
with quality experience as a quality and testing specialist and rephrasing this in

147
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,580
the terms we use in modern testing if you're given a role where you're in

148
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,100
charge of program management of an organization we want to look at it from

149
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,700
a quality and testing specialist no I don't well care to do that okay as a

150
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:34,420
quality leader all right okay which is I think me as a testing specialist how

151
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,060
would you tell what would you do for PM yeah well I think it's important I

152
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,220
think a lot of people a lot of non-modern testers may approach this

153
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:52,020
challenge with a hammer I would have mandates and these things and I don't

154
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,100
think it's necessarily the right way to do it but I can give some context about

155
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,580
the org and the way we work as we go but I'm just going to throw this to you

156
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,260
I'll rephrase the question one more time so as a quality leader which you are

157
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,700
even though you're in data science so as a quality leader you're in charge of

158
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,540
program management for a large organization making sure all their

159
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,900
programs rumbling talk about what that means as needed what are some things you

160
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,160
do and how would you measure them or how would you measure success okay I was

161
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,240
kind of hoping you'd answer the second question do you want me to do that

162
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,740
first yeah I know actually I think that's better unless the answer is

163
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:33,100
nothing no the answer is not nothing so the second half is in so in my

164
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,260
experience what have I learned about having the control of that and so far of

165
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,780
what matters but I think that that's more of a follow-up to the discussion

166
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,140
from you I can talk about what I've done and what I haven't done because

167
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,700
there's you know how you are you're in a new role and you're figuring it out you

168
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,100
feel like yeah yeah I'm getting this I'm getting this I'm getting this and you

169
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,020
get to a point look back and go oh I could have done that stuff a lot better

170
00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:00,990
I'm kind of at that stage to do this longer would be easy the first thing the

171
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,910
first thing I would do is essentially start executing against a Reese style

172
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:13,860
playbook program management program management project management PM mate

173
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:22,420
their job is to help you grow the business by creating happy customers okay

174
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,180
sounds a lot like accelerate the achievement of shipable quality except

175
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:38,960
in my view the PM role should be at least if not more one milestone ahead of

176
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,000
the rest of the engineering team so I think you're confusing a little bit I

177
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,360
mean let's let's get our PM roles here that's a set context so we have product

178
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,600
managers who are and that's more like what our program manager roles were at

179
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Microsoft a little bit more like the product owner so the project the

180
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,240
product manager they're the ones who talk to the customer figure out what we're

181
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,560
building establish the where a requirement doc or better stories that

182
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,400
define what the feature is what the things are we're building okay they

183
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,640
figure out they're the ones figuring out what's the hypothesis for the

184
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,600
experiments were running I change my view of this text and just put in

185
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,320
release manager well no because that's and I know you're yeah so when you're

186
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,600
talking about PM that so product managers do those sorts of things so my role is

187
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,720
there is some release management in there and I've done that role before

188
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,240
but it's a lot more risk management a lot of my role is making sure that

189
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,220
people are doing the right things to plan their work to make sure I mean we

190
00:17:52,220 --> 00:18:01,020
do p50 estimates which are surprisingly good I can go into those later I make

191
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:09,140
sure that 50% probability will hit the estimate on this date so take a chunk out

192
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,420
of hubroids how to measure anything book we're gonna try and estimate with a 50%

193
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,100
probability that will hit this date okay that's what we made by feet of p50

194
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,020
estimates so I'm making sure people are talking to each other making sure

195
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:27,980
coordination between teams is working as needed are like most teams when a

196
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,540
sub team needs to ship something they do it very well and their predictions are

197
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,820
very accurate and quality is high as features or functionality begins to span

198
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:46,790
multiple groups of teams is when more risk is introduced I'll say so I try and

199
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,710
make sure I can identify where those areas are get the right people talking

200
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,430
ask a lot of good questions I'm good at precision questioning or just asking

201
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,230
like what's the worst thing that could go wrong if you ship this tomorrow and

202
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,670
they freak out and create a whole big list of work items to go investigate

203
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,830
which is good so things like that so I'm really just trying to resolve

204
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,430
constantly trying to mitigate risk across the organization so that's my

205
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:20,810
role mitigate or prevent prevent if I can I'll take mitigate okay and the risk

206
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,650
you perceive is what it's primarily lack of communication the risk is complexity

207
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,530
or lack of understanding of complexity when you look at estimates estimates

208
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:37,150
really are just an evaluation of complexity so I try and make sure that

209
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:45,670
we have more context to evaluate that complexity so that we can make better

210
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:54,790
choices and or trade-offs or communicate downstream or etc etc so that's the

211
00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:00,790
difference in and that's fairly constant in what I've read in the books that I

212
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,550
found that have been about program management and the writing online about

213
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:12,120
program management versus product or project management okay so in the

214
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,400
context of the role you're talking about the decision around what to ship

215
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:25,020
what we're gonna start working on is already made your your role the way you

216
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:32,080
describe is now around reducing the risk and increasing predictability of the

217
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,360
delivery is that right sure part of it which is I think why it ties into

218
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:45,180
quality quite well if the outcome variables so in some regards like what you

219
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:53,030
describe you keep not care about quality at all right your job is someone

220
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:58,670
made a decision to ship this we're gonna ship this damn it no no no I never said

221
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,790
that no no so how does quality play into this what what what pivots do

222
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,710
you have in your role as a quality leader here or is that maybe the

223
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,550
question how do we introduce quality into this the answers to your question

224
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,710
are sort of endless I guess the reason for the trying to explain a little bit

225
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,950
what I do was to provide you context because in your answer to the question

226
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,790
you are falling into the traditional Microsoft definition of program management

227
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:33,160
which isn't program management no no no so I here's what I have in my head

228
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:41,760
right I think of a train station okay you're the you're the the guy that's

229
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,840
standing on outside of the train station with the stopwatch making sure the train

230
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,260
leaves on time but someone else has already decided what what the train

231
00:21:52,260 --> 00:22:02,210
schedule is what the destination no no no that that's not it at all so I'm

232
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:09,180
trying to map it I mean you're right there's a very different is there

233
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:16,460
actually maybe we should just go this way is there a role at Microsoft that is

234
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,300
directly is there a title at Microsoft that's directly to the thing that you're

235
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,700
talking about no okay so that we're gonna have to go to get on the more

236
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,060
complex so yeah so the product manager when does when does their jurisdiction

237
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:38,980
stop in your start that's a good way to ask that I would say that they're

238
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,700
defining what we build the engineering team and I'm part of engineering okay the

239
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:52,000
engineering team builds it I work a lot on how what about when when is up to the

240
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,560
engineering team so one thing I really like about our org is we have a mantra

241
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,480
or a statement only engineers can give dates so a product manager can say here's

242
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,320
what we want to build here's the stories and they'll say okay it'll be done by

243
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,560
June tober 15th I say oh no we need something sooner I say okay fine cut

244
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:18,710
scope more re-estimate otherwise June tober is alright so your job is to

245
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:28,460
address how I would say largely how yes how okay which is why your release

246
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,100
manager thing isn't too far off but typically that role is only effective

247
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:47,100
or only prominent later in the cycle do you do you have the ability to declare

248
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:55,770
we've made a decision and we are stopping this work no but I can and have

249
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:02,380
made recommendations along those lines which are generally followed okay all

250
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,780
right so I leave it I leave that decision to the product team I give them

251
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,580
the information so that I'm not I'm not a I'm not the guy with the stopwatch and

252
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,250
the whistle deciding when trains leave all right so when we talk about quality

253
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:25,100
are we are we talking about how would I now term code correctness no not at all

254
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,100
I don't I don't I only cover that if someone's really messed up and I really

255
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,700
have to okay so in terms of the role that you described to me it seems like

256
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,580
quality what you have the ability to influence is make sure as part of the

257
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:48,800
requirements a definition of quality is the is considered right telemetry

258
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:56,770
monitors you guys operate a service knowledge around I constantly think of the

259
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,650
pivot and persevere meetings that's in the the Reese's book yeah right your job

260
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:08,740
is going to be to make sure that post ship those questions and those meetings

261
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:23,700
are efficient effective and informed yes but part of if you control how and I

262
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,460
guess to some degree what then to me the the number one metric that matters is

263
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:39,210
going to be it's going to involve cycle time mm-hmm and I'm thinking something

264
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:49,000
along the lines of some ratio of errors to cycle time sure right it's because

265
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,320
you want to be able to a key part of your role is how do you iterate and

266
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,800
move faster yes but how do you do that without incidence I it's so funny that

267
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,800
after all that roundabout way like I didn't know where we were gonna go you

268
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,180
kind of ended up with the right answer anyway okay so cycle time is important

269
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,540
if we go back to I can remember who put it this way one of the three but I

270
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,300
bring it up all the time it's in fact I brought it up in a conversation

271
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,980
yesterday about a related subject it was a conversation about how we manage

272
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:34,420
programs and for context I wanted to manage my proposal was that we manage

273
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:41,800
feature or functionality or product work differently than we manage experiments

274
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,640
but well I make the experiments visible so anyway but I kept my role is to this

275
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,680
is stolen right from one of the three I wish I remember two but I give you full

276
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,720
credit pat yourself on the back if you're listening our goal is to reduce

277
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:03,600
the time from product hypothesis to customer feedback so that's the cycle

278
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,450
timer cycle time in Jason yeah going back to accelerate the look one of the

279
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,210
metrics they say is an indicator or a predictor of quality is deployment

280
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:23,770
frequency we reduce time from product hypothesis to customer feedback if you

281
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:33,000
yeah if you have a case your job oh this is this is not gonna get really

282
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,920
interesting so the KPI and our listeners are going thank God it's getting

283
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:49,000
interesting so the this is in your job is to measure and increase adaptability

284
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,490
yes I want to write that one down keep going because reduce time from product

285
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:08,460
hypothesis to customer feedback right first and foremost love it so it

286
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:19,250
basically says okay my stuff you know my I might even classify that now you know

287
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,850
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna specify an additional thing on that one

288
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:32,850
reduce time and waste from product hypothesis to customer feedback because

289
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:46,620
what I was I was thinking through is you want to reduce the cycle time your job

290
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:54,790
is to fail faster and faster yes yes that's the exact see very much the scope

291
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,870
of my conversation about experiments my argument was that I I met with one of

292
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:04,670
our data scientists are really got smart data scientists in Montreal and

293
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:09,770
we had a long conversation about how our experiments take too long why do they

294
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:17,130
lots of reasons I'm not good lots of reasons that are not fair for me to go

295
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:25,340
into on a public podcast we have we assume their unity technical IP reasons

296
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,940
in some cases yes it's also our data science team and monetization is fairly

297
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,660
new but anyway most of our experiments come from our data science team but I

298
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,340
want to use what they're doing and accelerating their ability to experiment

299
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,900
to build a culture of experimentation across the other teams as well so that's

300
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,740
all part of my master plan yeah so I'm heavily in a bunch of experiments of

301
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:55,140
course so right now right and the the team I'm interacting with we have not

302
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:02,460
implemented any sort of experimentation framework doing an experiment takes a

303
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:11,660
developer to hand code and hand separate the sample we have many of the

304
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:21,980
same issues and and even then once it rolls out you'll you'll very quickly

305
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:31,750
discover crap the two experiments aren't clean enough because they both share

306
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,790
this one variable that invalidates the experiment and then you have to do it all

307
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:45,030
over again yeah it's not it's it's not friction-free yeah I get that so yeah so

308
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,070
many of the same issues so not going into details yes there's many things that

309
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,230
can slow down your ability to experiment and fail fast so yes now now we're

310
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,230
getting somewhere this is I like it when conversations go this way we're

311
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:02,070
actually eventually reaching some agreement there's a time over cost that

312
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,980
is important in your role and I'm trying to figure out how to put that in

313
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:15,020
right you can fail faster and faster and faster right you let's say

314
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:22,340
presumably you could put a backlog of hypotheses that can all be independently

315
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:28,580
tested as experiments it's probably not true but let's let's assume okay but the

316
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:35,060
way you do that is it takes a thousand man-hours every day to pull it off

317
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:40,610
that's too expensive that's way expensive yes right and so it's it's it

318
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:46,250
needs to be easy to experiment it's the the price tag associated with

319
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:56,660
improvements in cycle times is something to take on does this flow I'm

320
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,740
trying to recall if low has a KPI here that you can it's interesting because I

321
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,660
was thinking about this I'm not obviously in Mike in Microsoft

322
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,580
recording this but right on my desk at home there's usually one book I'm

323
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,220
referring to on my desk in front of me and the one I pulled off the shelf

324
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,260
last night to think about this was flow it's on my desk better know I'm

325
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:23,580
gonna look it up yeah a lot of a lot of what he does is justify the principles

326
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:30,410
and and explains it with science why that's the principle right so obviously

327
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,970
smaller smaller chunks is one way you're gonna do this yes one hypothesis

328
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:44,740
at a time is a great way to build smaller and smaller chunks right the one

329
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:52,370
hypothesis at a time per feature right I would it would I would not be failing

330
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:58,790
fast enough if we were on one experiment at a time overall no the sequencing will

331
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:07,810
kill you yeah a lot of teams will do pairwise deployments as long as the the

332
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:15,940
features are mutually exclusive and don't mess or step on each other right

333
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,590
so there's an art and science to how do you how do you deploy these multiple

334
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,550
different experiments into one payload so that you can reduce calendar time on

335
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:32,900
this putting in feature flags and putting in the mechanism that track

336
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:41,580
because people today deal with DLL hell as well as version hell and then when

337
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:49,460
you add in flights that are making very real I took me a while dot feature the

338
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:57,300
DLL is that library thing on Windows it's really shitty right DLL have an

339
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:04,500
equivalent in every operating system it is a it is a versioned package whether you

340
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:13,100
get it from new git DLL Python package whatever I guarantee you guys have it and

341
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:25,600
it's a problem the yeah so let me go let me back up here and get and and I want

342
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,440
to get back towards I think we're on to something with the measurements and

343
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,120
some things I've been thinking about so as a quality leader and I think

344
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,880
quality leader we've thought of things like flow we've read accelerate we have

345
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,400
ideas on what it takes to get quality software to our customers and we know

346
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,850
it's not all testing that goes back to your functional correctness thing it's

347
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:53,270
how do we make sure we're delivering something valuable or something it's we

348
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:58,350
can get valuable feedback from that gives value to our customers and we had

349
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:07,240
mentioned error rate frequent to look at deployment frequency incidence divided by

350
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,760
deployment frequency we get an error rate that should decrease if quality is

351
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,900
going up and then a little bit about velocity no no I'm gonna push back on

352
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:25,290
that okay so I'm thinking about Reese okay so I think one of the mistakes that

353
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,730
a lot of people make in this case is that they they go back to what you

354
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:42,910
say they track error rate what you need is a positive metric to improve versus

355
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:48,470
one and I like is more powerful and the reason the reason I bring up error rate

356
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:54,950
errors per deployment is that's one of the predictors of quality that's listed

357
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,510
in accelerate so what would be the inverse of that what will be what

358
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,990
metric will be try to improve rather than do you remember the episode we

359
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:13,070
talked about where where I taught you my little hypothesis process yes very much

360
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:21,180
so it's completely ripped off and re-embodied in the principal five six

361
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,650
principal six forgot them all episode of the ministry of testing course which

362
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:37,110
is coming out next week anyway go on plug so Reese came here to Microsoft and I

363
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:43,430
managed to grab a seat when he came in and he talks about you grabbed his seat

364
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:50,670
no AC okay I have all right I would have maybe and I don't want to

365
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,110
summarize the whole first three well I do want to summarize the whole first three

366
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:02,840
chapters so he worked on this he was talking about the initial when you when

367
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,160
you're in an entrepreneurial role which may not always be the case and in in the

368
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,900
topic that you're talking about when you're trying to break into a brand-new

369
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:20,470
market you think you have created something that is an innovation and he

370
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:30,820
always recommends first see if anyone cares yes right and he talked through an

371
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:41,060
alternative strategy to the critical failure that caused him to write lean

372
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:48,900
startup okay I'm not gonna summarize the book but I am gonna summarize the book

373
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:55,180
I'm just not gonna go into detail and then I'll and then I'll they they had a

374
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:02,620
large number of people who worked 40 hour days for six months straight because

375
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:12,620
they had an idea and they were convinced it would have been awesome and the day

376
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:19,160
came to ship and they got 12 people to download the project that they and

377
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,480
several other people had killed themselves over the last six months to

378
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:31,670
deliver okay far from a solid ROI mm-hmm statement we've all yep that that's a

379
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:36,710
common story in software and so he spent time in and we've we talked about this

380
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:41,990
in retrospective episodes but he spent time thinking about what could I have

381
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:49,740
done differently to come to the same conclusion sooner yeah but this is

382
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,500
going back to the now let's talk about errors and failures let me let you

383
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,420
finish up and we're talking I think we're talking about two different things

384
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:02,700
but you may wrap it up and make some magic connection go I I will and you

385
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:10,150
realize what he could have done is created a website advertising his product

386
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:19,980
with a button that says click here to download in at the seminar he stated I

387
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:28,770
would have learned exactly the same thing but that would have been infinitely

388
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:34,010
cheaper to produce I just gave that same suggestion to someone last week

389
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,690
we're talking about a we're not sure which of these three or four features

390
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,970
we're going to add next to this component I said add buttons for all of

391
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:45,870
them and track who clicks what and then he said it in the seminar by the way

392
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:54,280
he asked the crowd would I have had to implement that download button or would

393
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:05,020
a 404 been fine answer of course 404 would be fine right and so that's where

394
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,060
that's what triggered on the the error cases because in that case you would

395
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,940
have a sharp rise in 404 it's an ex I'm not talking about I mean it's expected

396
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,180
error it's an expected error so there's a huge difference overall we're using an

397
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:24,540
error to track product market fit and which is fine I'm talking about errors

398
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:32,350
that cause what we call an incident what some companies call an oops I don't know

399
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:37,150
it's something that causes people to go fix something in production Reese has no

400
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,710
intent of going to fix those 404s in that case there's there's no reason to

401
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:45,270
we just want to track the data it's a it's a cheap way what he's done the

402
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:52,560
404 is cheap telemetry you can track the 404 on the page request and that's

403
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,610
most most web servers will track that for you quite easily it's super smart

404
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:07,480
but what I'm talking about your he turned an error code into a value code so

405
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,200
looping this back into my original statement okay is that yes they're

406
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,640
going to there could be caveats depending on things that are

407
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,920
experiments or information gathering or trying to evaluate product market fit

408
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:29,800
versus actual errors that impact customer success now so now and my

409
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,180
original question was how do you turn that metric of errors per deployment and

410
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,660
these are errors as I described a moment ago into something that can be

411
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:46,180
measured as a positive thing you want to improve I or maybe we don't maybe

412
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,740
maybe I just push back and say actually counting errors per deployment and

413
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,100
reducing that is something we do want to improve errors per deployment is a

414
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:00,740
vanity metric you know that I do know it I know it's totally gameable but I

415
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,780
do know and trust the research by Forsgren et al and accelerate that

416
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,100
says it it along with their other four key metrics they came up with our

417
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,900
predictors of quality and I think they could be it's tough I forget what they're

418
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,460
called you can tell me what they're called when they measure they find that

419
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:23,900
all these things are indicative of high quality and services but correlates but

420
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,020
but the moment you begin measuring them they become less valuable what's that

421
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:36,980
called that's Hawthorne's effect it really is it's Hawthorne's effect

422
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,740
because the second you the people's behavior changes in accordance to how

423
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,900
they're being measured okay so let's and anytime you measure those error

424
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,500
rates it eventually comes down to who's accountable to reducing them so let's go

425
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,860
back to once again to the original question so as a quality leader what are

426
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,140
some things what I don't know about changes as tough you don't have the

427
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,420
context but what sorts of things would you measure to know that your program

428
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,660
effectiveness of my program I mean your ability to get if we go back to I forget

429
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,700
the quote but our ability to get feedback get value to our customers and

430
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,660
get feedback from them what are some other things that you would measure to

431
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:30,940
know if that was being effective or something that would be less gameable

432
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,010
you could track against and watch improve so here's something that's

433
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:44,420
actually the way you've now framed the question is extremely relevant I have

434
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:51,820
been asked to solve that problem for Azure Azure compute specifically great we

435
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:58,180
have the same job we just figured that out we don't have this I'm gonna do it

436
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:03,010
a fun way you're gonna do it by cat hurting or vice versa we'll see what

437
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:08,410
happens here's another way of phrasing it so so I will say I have ideas on this

438
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:18,850
one as it relates to compute but here's how I will generalize it in the absence

439
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:35,660
of surveys how do you measure a particular type of error and its

440
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:46,580
individual impact to see set don't you measure it without sending surveys

441
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:57,860
don't surveys are revenue lost revenue lost is a negative metric but if you

442
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:10,010
revenue not lost no so I'll tell you have you heard of the CLB common

443
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:15,890
language verification no no customer lifetime oh oh we just call it ltv

444
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:26,900
lifetime value but okay sure makes sense my current my current thinking is that I

445
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:32,060
would expect to see if we're going in the right direction I would expect to

446
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:41,060
see CLB go up of course the problem is you need time to be able to see those

447
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:48,960
trends maybe yep and so you want to be able to you want to be able to say

448
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,240
actually I'm gonna go back to my experience and being we had the ability

449
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,360
in being because we had everything till we had everything hooked up we could

450
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:08,100
track changes to we could track changes to an individual check-in and because

451
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:17,780
every query generates ad revenue in that particular case it was very easy to

452
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,860
look and draw connections to Alan you're checking yesterday cost the

453
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,860
business one thousand two hundred and eighty four dollars and fifteen cents we

454
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:35,940
had that ability in big is because both the revenue side and the telemetry side

455
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:46,220
are near real-time okay our our ability to measure that is lagging that as is

456
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:58,590
mine support request is another heuristic what you trying to do yes so

457
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:03,480
okay you have no choice I've talked myself into it all right until you have a

458
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:11,100
near real-time signal that expresses a positive happy point and maybe it's

459
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:20,180
usage which is common in in an experiential stuff right like the website

460
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:27,150
we talked about then yeah you have to you have to do two things you have you

461
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,790
will have to measure error rate but then you have to have something else that

462
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:39,860
is running lagged behind that quantifies the importance of that error rate when

463
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:46,180
it first rolls out you're gonna have to treat ever ever every error rate has

464
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:52,940
equivalently important to some degree but then over time you're gonna have to

465
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:58,260
do a correlation and be able to determine which errors are actually more important

466
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:06,020
than others yes going out of time here and I apologize I'll I will try and

467
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,140
fix this in editing as I always do but over the course of the podcast

468
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,740
Brent has moved himself farther and farther and farther away from the

469
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,220
microphone he actually moved the microphone closer to his body and then

470
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:26,220
slumped way back so he's I'll fix it as I always do but I would push back and

471
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:31,940
say I there have to be and there must be and there are things that I could

472
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:39,100
measure without that that's obviously a very good measure to without having real

473
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:49,300
time feedback on the cost of every change your job is to reduce the time

474
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:55,180
between product hypotheses and customer feedback you need both elements of

475
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,620
customer feedback because what you're trying to grow have you heard of NPS

476
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:06,050
what what is Microsoft call NPS no it's not Microsoft F you it's the world all

477
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:11,100
right NPS is net promoter score yes I have heard of net promoter score okay

478
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:18,340
you're trying to find that and that one is the world you were trying to find a

479
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:24,970
telemetric version of net promoter score right if you just track error rates

480
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:33,000
then you you aren't going to be able to accurately measure the net benefit yes

481
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,560
error rates went up but that's because this thing is super popular yeah and the

482
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,520
people who love what yeah once again we're talking about different things so

483
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:50,140
error rates are in I know you're talking about and oh my god and I don't

484
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,460
know what to do with it just I think tire put you in a straight jacket and

485
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:02,990
just put your headset on you so we have error rate of course for 404s for

486
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:05,910
example all the different things for what I'm talking about for errors to

487
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,510
deployment because yeah you can have like an intermittent error that you get a

488
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,630
million users on you know more a bunch more hits on doesn't mean quality went

489
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,350
down quality actually went up because you have more usage and people are using

490
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:20,030
your application I'm talking about things that cause errors at the level

491
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:25,590
they cause what you could call an outage or an incident or something that

492
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:31,590
requires intervention something that may require something that may cause either a

493
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:37,190
inability to move forward or in worst case a revenue loss that level of error

494
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:44,900
per deployment is what I want to reduce oh okay so I'm sent turns out I'm already

495
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:53,900
central to that for core compute I don't if the question is how would you

496
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,780
change the program manager role essentially to reduce outages that's one

497
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,060
part of it emmer out of time okay but I I think we need to continue this

498
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:13,900
discussion because I think we had a lot of miscommunication on definitions it took

499
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,820
a while to get on the same page and I think we got there and I think what I've

500
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,940
discovered is that in our roles we do a lot of the same things which I find

501
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:31,530
interesting from a oh my mr. hyperactive hands over here it just

502
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:39,690
accidentally shoved his microphone down his pants so from a modern testing

503
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:45,690
perspective it's cool that we are largely in the same place but I that is

504
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:50,490
interesting and from a program manager perspective is just making sure people

505
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,010
are doing really it's making sure people are doing the right things you

506
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:57,530
may have been in the test architect group 15 years ago when I described my

507
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:06,770
role as I stop people from being stupid and well that's well I phrase it

508
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,490
differently now but it's like it's my more mature result is I try and help

509
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:18,590
people make good choices so it's a parental role sure all right I gotta go

510
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:24,270
okay you gotta go we're gonna talk more about this next time I'm well I'm

511
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:31,480
definitely I'm definitely not Brent and I am okay
