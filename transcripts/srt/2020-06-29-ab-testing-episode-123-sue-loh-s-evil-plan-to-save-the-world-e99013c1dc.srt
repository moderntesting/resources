Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,980
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,370
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hey, Brent, how's it going?

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,210
Going good, Alan. All right. That's enough of that small talk. We are not alone today.

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:34,370
We have an old colleague of mine, not old in age, but someone who I worked with.

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,810
Let me finish. I'm going to let you finish, Brent. Someone I work with, I think last time

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,210
we crossed paths, we'll do a little catch up here about 15 years ago. I'd like to welcome

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,930
Sue Lowe to the AB testing podcast. Hi, Sue.

9
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,210
Thank you. Hi, nice to talk to you.

10
00:00:52,210 --> 00:01:02,180
It's been a while, right? I'm going to see if I can recollect. I think I left CE in 2005

11
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,260
and we worked a Windows CE for those of you that were for the millennials there. It was

12
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,620
an old embedded version of Windows. It was fun.

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,250
It was IoT before IoT was a thing.

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,050
It was ahead of its time. It was ahead of its time. We used to build like entire operating

15
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,530
systems and web services with device drivers that booted off of a floppy disk. Once again

16
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,890
for the millennials, a floppy disk was a little thing you shoved into your computer that had

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,940
data on it. Kind of like a USB key.

18
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,940
It wasn't floppy.

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,460
No. Well, if you tore it apart, it was, but then you couldn't use it anymore.

20
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,740
I'm not going to try and remember everything. Maybe you, did you move away while working

21
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,580
on CE? Didn't you move to Atlanta or something?

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,580
Yeah, I was working remotely.

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,500
I remember. But then you came back.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:58,100
Yeah, my husband had, he wanted to do an academic job and there's only one university here in

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,380
Seattle and if you don't get a job there, you have to choose other things. So he went

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,980
to Georgia Tech and I went with him and luckily the team let me stay working remotely.

27
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,350
That's cool. And then you decided to come back. So I'm not going to walk through your

28
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,950
whole career because I'm not, well, I do want to catch up a little bit on what

29
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,270
you've been up to since then. There's another bigger topic that you know I want to get to.

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:27,030
But first, let's just, I am curious, both for, mostly for me, but I think the listeners

31
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,350
find it interesting. So what have you been up to the last 15 years?

32
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:40,940
Well, working on Windows CE turned into working on Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. And I

33
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,180
had a great time working on Windows Phone. I loved that product with all my heart and

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:53,300
it slowly died. As that product disappeared, we all got organized into the Windows team and

35
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I worked on the Windows team for a while until one day I decided I wanted to get back to

36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,330
devices again and looked around and found a friend on the HoloLens team and managed

37
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,290
to finagle my way into working on HoloLens. So I've been doing that for the last, almost

38
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,300
the year now. And what do you do on the HoloLens team? What's your specialty?

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,960
I work with our telemetry data. Part of my work is just watching our reliability and

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:31,940
making sure we fix all the crashes, including some stuff on Unity, by the way. But mostly

41
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:41,720
a lot in our own code. And then also actually building out the pipeline for our government

42
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,880
product that we have. I want to ask, but I'm probably not allowed

43
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:53,000
to government product. Well, it's publicly announced. There's a military HoloLens product where

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,160
you could imagine augmented reality things you might do with Soldier.

45
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,230
So what's the biggest bug you're worried about with that product?

46
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,790
Leaking data onto the public internet.

47
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,180
Oh, yeah, that's one hack away from everyone being a Soldier.

48
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,830
Right. Which might be fun.

49
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:26,220
When we work together on Windows CE, you're working on performance, but it was file system

50
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,740
stuff as well. I know in Windows you're on doing performance, looking at low level

51
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,820
performance fixes. What keeps you, you like working in the guts of things.

52
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,140
So what keeps you excited about that? What's interesting about that for you?

53
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:51,740
I love the chase, you know, investigating really tough things where you've got a sniff of

54
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,140
what's going on and you have to dig and try to figure it out.

55
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,460
You know, when you finally figure it out, it was always a story, you know.

56
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,700
That's a good parallel into the real reason you're here.

57
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,620
I'm seeing some parallels between our main topic of the day and the story you just told.

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,380
I always like the debugging, too.

59
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,220
Yeah, I could tell stories, but it's your podcast today, so I'm going to stop.

60
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,460
But I love debugging.

61
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,220
And someone today, I just helped them find a clue.

62
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,220
They said this is like Colombo where we're under where we're uncovering clues to find things.

63
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,620
It's really fun. So I'll stop there.

64
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,100
But let me move on to the real reason you're here and we could talk.

65
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,580
We could do a whole podcast talking about what you've done and the interesting things

66
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,620
you found. And I think it's all really cool.

67
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,180
I love that kind of work.

68
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,860
But what's more important is you have an evil plan to save the world.

69
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140
Yes. And that is fantastic.

70
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,460
And I want to hear more about it.

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,140
Tell me about your evil plan to say.

72
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,140
Actually, don't tell me. I know it.

73
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,580
Tell everyone listening about your evil plan to save the world.

74
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:07,900
Sure. It started several years ago when I was listening to an NPR story about how

75
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,140
the Hunger Games after the Hunger Games came out,

76
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,300
the number of girls taking archery skyrocketed.

77
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,870
And I said, wow, you know, if big companies like Microsoft and Amazon and Google

78
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,110
were really interested in improving the diversity of people doing software,

79
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:37,820
they should hire people to make best selling novels and movies about kids

80
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:44,050
saving the world with software and get more girls and more diverse people

81
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,050
interested in working with software by making it as cool as the Hunger Games made archery.

82
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:57,490
So I was mostly just kind of talking about this and wishing I could make something happen.

83
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,490
And a friend of mine said, you know, ghost writers exist.

84
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,570
Let's go. Let's make it happen.

85
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,250
And I told them to go away because he was scaring me.

86
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,450
But that, you know, started me on the journey where I said, OK,

87
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,370
if I were to really do this, you know, like, do I have a story?

88
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,850
What would I have as as the basis of this thing?

89
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,490
And it took me probably about a year to come up with the list of characters and a plot.

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,290
And so I started looking up ghost writers and realized how much it was going to cost.

91
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,890
So I decided to run a kickstarter to pay for the ghost writing.

92
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,850
And so it does help that having been in the software industry for 20 years,

93
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,290
I knew a lot of people.

94
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,170
I basically emailed everyone I had connected to me on LinkedIn,

95
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,370
which was like 800 people at the time.

96
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,730
And that, you know, since it was something a lot of people in software care about,

97
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,170
trying to improve the diversity of the people in the software industry,

98
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,850
a lot of people helped out.

99
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,930
And so I managed to fund this through a kickstarter.

100
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,410
And it took the author and me together about a year to put it together.

101
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,810
And then, um, me more time to get it published.

102
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,250
And it was just published about a month ago on May 20th.

103
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,750
And it, to be clear, is a book called Raven.

104
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,710
Yes. Which I've read and enjoyed very much.

105
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,870
Thank you.

106
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,950
I'm not afraid to read a young adult thriller.

107
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,530
Yeah, it's targeted at middle schoolers.

108
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,650
And it is funny.

109
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,330
I asked my mom what she thought and her answer was, well,

110
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,330
you could tell it's not written for me.

111
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,970
There's a lot of, you know, like kids talking to each other and lingo and stuff.

112
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,850
And, um, so that's okay.

113
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,010
The, but it's aimed at the middle school, young high school age folks.

114
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,330
Uh, just trying to give my maturity.

115
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,490
I like it.

116
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,930
I honestly, I read that book with a huge smile on my face.

117
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,050
Cause it's just fun.

118
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,940
It's aimed at that age group.

119
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,660
Uh, and it's really just a fun story.

120
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,620
You know, at the end of the day, kids aren't going to read it if it's not a fun story.

121
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,420
So, uh, we did our best to make it something that folks in that age group would enjoy.

122
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:31,140
And it's, uh, the premise of the book is what if software companies got tired of

123
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,340
waiting for, you know, the ability to hire more people.

124
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,500
Cause it's, it's so hard to find people.

125
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,660
They start running their own academies where you go to the school for free, uh,

126
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,980
spend time there earning the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in computer science.

127
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,300
And when you're done, you work at the company to pay off the cost of your

128
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,780
schooling, and then you're free to go and do whatever you want.

129
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,100
So, and the students are working on this team for the university and the

130
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,340
university, well, the, the academy and the company are hired to

131
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,060
investigate a hack at a bank.

132
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,740
I actually came up with this plot before Experian got hacked.

133
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,420
And then when that came into the news, I was like, I got to publish this

134
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,140
book before more things come true.

135
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,980
Uh, so yeah, they, they are investigating a hack at a bank and, uh, it turns out

136
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,540
to be, you know, a mystery of what's going on earlier.

137
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,940
And with no intention at all on asking like what kept you interested in tech, I

138
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,940
saw a parallel between the story you told me, like the, the, uh, investigation

139
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,660
and the discovery and the detective work and what happens in Raven.

140
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,420
So obviously intentional.

141
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,740
And the book, the book has a lot of, a lot of really cool tech ideas

142
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,940
in it too, which were fun.

143
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,380
So I'm just curious.

144
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,340
How did that work between you and the ghost writer?

145
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,900
Cause I assume the ghost writer maybe didn't have that tech background.

146
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,660
What's that relationship like?

147
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,140
So, uh, I don't have the right to give away my ghost writer's name, but

148
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,220
I'm not asking that.

149
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,820
Yeah.

150
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,500
But she had actually worked in the tech industry.

151
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,820
She was actually a, uh, involved in, uh, the production of windows 95.

152
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,690
And so, um, it, that was,

153
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,650
It narrows it down.

154
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:29,650
Yeah.

155
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,210
Well, a woman,

156
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,130
but it still won't tell you who it was, but, uh, yeah.

157
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:43,210
And she had actually even had problems with being, uh, mistreated as a person

158
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,690
in the tech industry at the time.

159
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,260
So it was, you know, she turned out to be a great partner on this last year.

160
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,380
And Brett, you don't know this.

161
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,780
Um, one thing I know, so I've, I can write technical stuff all day.

162
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,740
I did the Howie test software at Microsoft book and articles here and there.

163
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,180
Last year for a nano Rimo, I wrote about 10,000 words of a, maybe 20,000 words

164
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,760
of a, of a business fiction novel about this modern testing thing.

165
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,480
And it's all it's no, but it's awful.

166
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
So I'm picking your brain.

167
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,760
So that was, that was part of the intent also of hiring a ghost

168
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,000
writer was to get an actual professional to do it so that it would be a good book.

169
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,600
Yeah.

170
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,920
The stories in my head that I think about when I'm walking, or I go to write them

171
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,680
down and I better just stick to writing a technical descriptions of things, but

172
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
it's just really cool.

173
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,880
So in Raven, I really enjoyed how the plot, I don't want to give away any

174
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,040
spoilers, you've done well, how the plot, uh, the problems that we're solving and

175
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,040
even getting to know more about the characters all kind of happened in

176
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,800
parallel.

177
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,400
I think that made it a page turner for me.

178
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,800
I don't know.

179
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,930
I, I don't know if there's a question there or not, but it just, you know, even

180
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,450
reading a book targeted for someone slightly younger than me, uh, it all

181
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,450
kind of fell together.

182
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,090
I, I, you know, as the person I mentioned before, oh, I love debugging.

183
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,110
That's the part that really, that really got me was just watching them

184
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,590
discover the problem and the problem unfold.

185
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,190
And then then the, the students who are, you're talking about, they get their

186
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,790
equivalent of their, their, their BA in computer science, they're all in high

187
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,110
school and smarter than any BA I ever interviewed in my life.

188
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
So it's fun.

189
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,640
It's fun.

190
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,440
And anyway, just to comment there.

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,520
I, I was kind of proud to sort of get them in there looking at performance

192
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,040
logs and things, uh, you know, as a performance person, having some of the

193
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,040
problems in the story involved performance and similar investigations, the

194
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,240
things I would have done.

195
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,280
Uh, I was happy to get that in there.

196
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,160
Yeah.

197
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,990
And you also covered, uh, some of the Jerry Weinberg says in software,

198
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,870
eventually it's always a people problem.

199
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,390
And the book also covers in the character development, how much the

200
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,310
relationships and conflicts and, and even teamwork among the team members.

201
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,150
Uh, it felt very real to me.

202
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:17,950
Yeah.

203
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,030
Uh, you know, one of the other things I wanted to portray was the fact that,

204
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,270
uh, software is not necessarily just writing code, you know, there are a lot

205
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,070
of different things that, uh, you can go into and software, it's a pretty broad,

206
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,550
you know, you, you've worked in testing, I've worked in performance, you know,

207
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,150
um, you sure, you have to know how to write code, but it's not necessarily

208
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,630
the thing that you love about it.

209
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,190
And one of the characters, it didn't entirely come out, but it was specific to

210
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:56,870
her, but like, uh, the character, um, Wiz was intended to be somebody who was

211
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,750
actually really good with people and understanding people and figuring

212
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,830
out what people needed.

213
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,670
And, um, other people were intended to have different kind of focuses

214
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,110
on what they were good at.

215
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,910
Uh, so I wanted to show that you didn't have to love writing code in

216
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,910
order to love working on software.

217
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,120
Yeah.

218
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,400
And that definitely comes out.

219
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,690
And, and as you know, like I've mentioned, I've been in more infrastructure

220
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,530
and, and DevOps roles, which are a lot about there's use code to solve some

221
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,050
problems, but it's more about just kind of making things work, making

222
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,650
things easier to solve.

223
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,930
And of course, working in performance, it's, you mentioned earlier, it's

224
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,730
looking at a lot of data than figuring out what to do.

225
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,650
And then maybe writing code to help you in some ways to help you understand

226
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,290
what you're looking at.

227
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,250
And then of course, looking at the code to figure out how does this relate

228
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,650
into what's happening here and what can we fix here?

229
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,170
And that thinking part is a lot of fun.

230
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:56,610
Right.

231
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:56,970
Brent,

232
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,850
I wonder if it's just a maturity model.

233
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:07,210
Like I was just thinking through, it has been a long time, uh, since I've

234
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:17,360
cared about the code I write, it's more around taking an idea and giving it birth.

235
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,350
Right.

236
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,470
It's solving a problem that wasn't solved before.

237
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,030
Like, um, Pete, my, my, so I have a 10 year old daughter.

238
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:32,430
Um, I, I've started sort of walking her through Python and it's interesting.

239
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,650
And I'm learning very, uh, a bunch of different things.

240
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,490
Both of my boys, uh, have learned Java.

241
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,370
They were older.

242
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,090
She's very different for her.

243
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,290
It's interesting because coding needs to be a social event.

244
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,580
Right.

245
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:59,030
Unlike me sitting down and writing code, uh, very introspective for her.

246
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,120
It's, it's, she's having fun.

247
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,360
If I'm sitting there with my laptop next to her writing code too.

248
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:08,730
Right.

249
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:15,610
It's if I, if I, if I close my laptop to start making dinner, her interest just

250
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,390
plummets, but I saw her doing some of the things this last time.

251
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,750
I don't know why I got on this topic, but I saw her doing things this last time.

252
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,720
Um, oh, I remember knowing where eventually, but not always gets to a point.

253
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,150
This is, um, I, I, I, I deserve the reputation of, I say in 20 words,

254
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,430
what takes three, I saw her going up on stack exchange and doing searches and

255
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,550
trying to find Python code that she could, she could copy paste.

256
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:55,910
And I'm like, wow, she's, she's, she's almost an actual professional.

257
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,630
Anyway, she asked me, you know, what languages do I know?

258
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,870
And, uh, and, uh, and I, I listed them off, but then I told her, I'm like,

259
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,950
what the reality is in my humble opinion, uh, I know them all now.

260
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:21,030
Uh, it's just, uh, it's because the patterns of coding languages are

261
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,970
all essentially the same, uh, they just have different approaches, like a

262
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,210
functional language, uh, sure.

263
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,170
I could code in it.

264
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,210
Don't want to.

265
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,210
It hurts my head.

266
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:42,420
Um, uh, in with one link, uh, link paradigm, I just can't get my head

267
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,620
wrapped around that one, but anyway, that was the aspect is the coding

268
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,430
language is not at all interesting anymore to me.

269
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:58,780
And I'm wondering if it's, if that's just because we're all, uh, experienced

270
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:05,400
and in, uh, you know, have, have time behind our belts on in this industry,

271
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,040
like the glamor of a new language and whatever.

272
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,380
I would like to point out that over the last week, I've been learning rust

273
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,450
and, and I like it.

274
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,810
I don't even know what I I've heard of it, but I don't know what

275
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,730
you would use it for.

276
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,170
It's actually for anything.

277
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,290
It's a, it's actually a lot like C and C plus plus with better

278
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,250
memory management.

279
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,200
So, uh, yeah, I've, I've enjoyed it so far.

280
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,080
Um, I don't know what I'd use it for.

281
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,300
Anything I write these days is in, actually, I don't write much code

282
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,580
anymore, but probably Python is the most you after writing C forever, uh,

283
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,940
Python, probably what I use the most.

284
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:57,340
So anyway, uh, Brent, the good story, uh, the, um, that nobody can see

285
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,860
my eyes roll in the podcast.

286
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,900
I have some more book questions, but before I forget, I do want to, I

287
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:11,380
know I'm pretty sure you do some other things for like English,

288
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,620
like extracurriculars to also get more people involved in tech.

289
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,020
And one of them is a thing that.

290
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,820
Another old colleague of ours, a former employee of mine still at

291
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,660
Microsoft did for a while.

292
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,940
I know you're heavily involved in now is hunt the wampus.

293
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,300
So I'm sure, which I want to hear about, but what else are you doing?

294
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,980
What's going on?

295
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,660
You're doing, you're doing stuff for people and I want to hear about it.

296
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,800
Wampus is one of the major other things I do.

297
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,280
Yeah.

298
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,400
Uh, before we go into that, I guess I don't, I'm trying to think of what

299
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,400
other I organized for my hockey team, but that's not particularly related to

300
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,520
software, um, I'm kind of a sucker and get involved in lots of things

301
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,600
because people can just sense that I can get involved and organized.

302
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,190
So, uh, it's a challenge to say no.

303
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,340
Um, so hunt the wampus.

304
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:09,860
Yeah.

305
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,940
I doubt other than you and I, maybe nobody knows what that is.

306
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,820
So tell me about it.

307
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,140
I would love to hear who it was that you worked with, but before we do that,

308
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,540
um, hunt the wampus is a program to get more students into computer

309
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:33,860
science by, uh, taking the students in a class, um, a computer class and

310
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,700
forming them into teams and then having mentors go help them, uh, through

311
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,220
a project, building a hunt them up this game.

312
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,260
So we give them a spec for how the game should be played and then help

313
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,380
them figure out how to turn that into objects and each student owns an object

314
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,820
and they work together to make this game.

315
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,900
And the really cool thing is, you know, they start out excited.

316
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,980
They have all these grand ideas for how they're going to make their game.

317
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,500
Uh, and then they get all bogged down in confusion because they don't actually

318
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,140
know how to turn that into something.

319
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,140
And we help them through all that confusion.

320
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,940
And then at the end, they've produced something that isn't quite what they

321
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,180
had dreamed up, but is at the end more than what they kind of expected

322
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,420
out of themselves and feel really proud about it.

323
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,540
So it's, it's really fun to mentor students through it.

324
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:34,100
And one of the cool things also is that the schools that we work with, we

325
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,940
end up growing their computer science program.

326
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,140
So I've been working with Redmond high school for about a decade.

327
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,860
When I started, we had one class, the computer science that we were working

328
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,980
with and this past year we had five.

329
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,780
And in fact, every year he keeps coming back and saying, yeah, I have more.

330
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,490
So that's cool.

331
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,850
It was, um, Evan Goldring was doing some of that many years ago.

332
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,970
He, he, uh, was involved in that.

333
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,610
It's a super cool program.

334
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,050
And I think it it's, it's across multiple.

335
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,090
I don't remember anymore, but it's across multiple high schools, right?

336
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,090
Yeah.

337
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,330
We work with, I think it was six area high schools this past year.

338
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:21,770
Um, the, and even it's been, we've had little sprinklings of things outside

339
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,410
of the, uh, Seattle area as well.

340
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,130
But the truth is, you know, we organize Microsoft mentors.

341
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,770
And so it tends to be here in the local Seattle area.

342
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,050
When I was in Atlanta, that's when I got involved.

343
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,290
I brought it to one of the high schools in Atlanta.

344
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,810
I was going to ask if it's spread out and, and now that the workforce of

345
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,170
every company is spread out amongst the whole world.

346
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,530
Uh, it's, it, maybe it could spread even wider this, this year.

347
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,210
Did you do hunt the wampus virtually or did it happen or what happened?

348
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,330
Uh, we, yeah, we work each spring.

349
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,090
Uh, we start in the schools around the end of January and then go through

350
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,890
the spring semester and end at the end of the school year where we

351
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,170
bring them all to Microsoft.

352
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,010
We, so we, not much of that happened.

353
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,890
Yeah.

354
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,610
So we, we did get started.

355
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,690
Um, most of our schools got about a month into it and then, uh, yeah,

356
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,410
the mentors weren't allowed at first.

357
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,130
It was no, no visitors.

358
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,890
The mentors weren't allowed to go to the schools and then eventually

359
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,370
all the students were sent home.

360
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,490
And, uh, for the most part, we just ended up shutting down the program.

361
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,450
We had two teams of students continue.

362
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,770
Um, one was a group of students who just self-organized at Redmond high

363
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,970
school and one was, there was a private school that we brought in for the

364
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,250
first time this year, uh, East side prep.

365
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,250
And those students, uh, the school was very, very well prepared to do things online.

366
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,090
They already had classes going on teams.

367
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,890
Uh, and they actually sent their students home earlier than the rest of

368
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,170
the public schools around here.

369
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,050
And so they just continued with business as usual and their mentors would help

370
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,290
them through the project over teams and, uh, everything was working great for them.

371
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,810
So they continued and this one group of determined students at Redmond high

372
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,330
school continued, and so we got two projects.

373
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,570
That's given the circumstances.

374
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,810
That's still very cool.

375
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,250
Hey, Brent, have you heard of hunt the wampus before?

376
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:30,420
I played it back back, uh, when I was seven, eight, the program, uh, that,

377
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,180
that sugus described, I had not, and I'm extremely interested, right?

378
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:44,060
Um, uh, one of the things that, that it is very possible, like, uh, my middle

379
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,620
someone, when he was coding, he'd never mentioned the term hunt the wampus,

380
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,260
but he had a similar thing where it ended with a field trip at Microsoft.

381
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:56,450
Right.

382
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,970
He might've been wampus.

383
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:05,320
He spent the, the entire day in a building 33.

384
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,790
Um, the, uh, I'll have to, I'll have to ask him the, but for my daughter, one of the

385
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:22,340
things, um, so have you gone into the lower age range I've gone through and.

386
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,900
She's, she's more advanced than, uh, what's that beginning thing that starts the

387
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,610
beginning programming thing that starts with an S scratch.

388
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,330
That's it.

389
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:33,810
Thank you.

390
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,130
Um, yeah.

391
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:44,490
Um, so she's more advanced than that, but, um, certain coding constructs confuses her.

392
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:52,130
And, and originally I had started with, um, uh, headfirst, uh, learning the code.

393
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,410
And love the headfirst series, but even that's too advanced.

394
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:05,070
So now what I've been looking for is, is, um, uh, little, little, very simple

395
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,870
projects where it's very clear the outcome.

396
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:16,270
It would be fun to do and now sort of reverse, reverse teaching her coding.

397
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,190
Instead of like sort of teaching her, this is what a for loop does.

398
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,310
And this is how to use it.

399
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,390
So instead of teaching the widget seats would begin to end and then go back

400
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,270
and explain the widgets, but what I'm looking for is sort of a open source, uh,

401
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:38,800
listing of little projects like that, that she can select from, um, doesn't

402
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,780
seem like that aspect has been well enough organized yet.

403
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,860
They like, like code kata for teens and tweens.

404
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,740
Right.

405
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,380
Exactly.

406
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,220
Right.

407
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,100
Right.

408
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,380
But yeah, my kids have lots of fun on code.org making little things.

409
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,220
That's basically scratch though.

410
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,060
And it's not, it's probably too boring for a, uh, someone your daughter's age.

411
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,580
Yeah.

412
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,740
She, she has this dream.

413
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:16,840
Um, her heroes right now are the female developers at, uh, Roblox.

414
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,860
She can list them off.

415
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:27,040
Sadly I can't, um, and she kind of wants to follow in the, in, in those shoes.

416
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,560
I love that.

417
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,200
She's got some role models.

418
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,880
Yeah.

419
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,760
Are these, are these, um, the people building Roblox or people

420
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,880
building cool stuff on Roblox?

421
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,720
Yes.

422
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,060
Both.

423
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,700
Yeah.

424
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:41,980
Yes.

425
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,820
Yes.

426
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,140
Um, and so she comes in and, uh, she comes in.

427
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,380
But some of the systems there, it gets her the ability to sort of

428
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,300
design things and she can sell things.

429
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:03,340
I haven't, I haven't dove enough into it to, to go, what exactly is she doing?

430
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,420
Um, I probably should.

431
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,860
Cause I think I can tie that to her coding adventure.

432
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:17,160
Anyway, Roblox, I've not takored a lot with it, but I did show my 11 year old

433
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,760
how to install their dev kit and get started.

434
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,000
And she was making her own platformer games within 15 minutes.

435
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,240
I was very impressed.

436
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,320
It's a great way to get some kids started.

437
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,040
That's impressive.

438
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,480
Yeah.

439
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,480
That's way easier than unity.

440
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:32,930
Yeah.

441
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,010
And I can say that,

442
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,290
yeah.

443
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:42,930
Uh, having spent, so when I got started on the HoloLens team, I, you know, it's

444
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,530
not my job to write HoloLens apps, but I wanted to see what it was like.

445
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,730
So I set aside a day and said, I'm going to spend this whole day learning how to

446
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,050
write HoloLens apps.

447
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,370
And four hours later, I was still trying to get unity and visual studio and

448
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:00,850
everything that we needed installed correctly in order to get started.

449
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,890
And that was enormously frustrating.

450
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,810
And that's something that we definitely need to fix for our product.

451
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,570
And, uh, I was impressed that Roblox just had an instant, you know,

452
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,770
download and you're done.

453
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,180
Yeah.

454
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,180
Both of my kids have gone through a programming and unity course for teens.

455
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,060
Uh, they're 16 and 14.

456
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,940
Uh, they did this a couple of years ago, maybe two summers ago.

457
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,620
Anyway, they can, they both, uh, learned some of the basics of it, but, uh, the,

458
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,940
the learning curve is it's there.

459
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,700
You can do some basics pretty well.

460
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,620
Uh, but yeah, getting it once you start trying to get to work with a

461
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,500
bunch of other things, it's a little bit of a, huh, what?

462
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,020
Yeah.

463
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,500
So yep.

464
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,660
Room for improvement there.

465
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,630
Uh, we can work together on that.

466
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,190
Yes.

467
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,310
Yeah.

468
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:52,590
So, um, for better, for worse, I don't work on that part of unity.

469
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,350
I just work in, in the ads business.

470
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,710
I make sure that game developers can make money off of their games.

471
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,390
Also important.

472
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,470
It is, it is.

473
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:07,190
Uh, so let's go back to the book a little bit.

474
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,830
I just have a couple more questions.

475
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,990
So maybe you can, I don't know if we can do this or not, but without any

476
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,510
spoilers and you mentioned earlier, you read the book with a smile on your face.

477
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,430
Do you have a favorite part of the book or a favorite?

478
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,350
And again, maybe you can't answer this without spoiling, but I'm curious, uh, did

479
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,310
like, was there a part of the book that turned out even better than you

480
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,150
expected, maybe I'll put it that way.

481
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,710
Uh, I can answer that without spoiling.

482
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,590
Uh, the spoilers are some of my favorite parts, but, uh, the, um, one of the

483
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:46,980
things that kind of happened as I and the writer went along was, uh, we ended up

484
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:52,780
kind of modeling a software development environment that is a lot more wholesome

485
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:58,780
than many, you know, uh, there's this character mom who's, you know, trying

486
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,140
to take care of the kids and like making them eat their vegetables and stuff,

487
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,540
you know, and always making sure that if they're up late working on something

488
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,180
that they get a sandwich, you know,

489
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,900
mom is awesome.

490
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:15,180
And it, you know, even, yeah, I'll just say that throughout the book, mom is awesome.

491
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,260
Yeah.

492
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,820
And, and so I was really proud, but it's more than just that, you know, like

493
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,740
there's Carver who's running the school, the academy, uh, and kind of, uh, I

494
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,500
don't know, quarterbacking their team also.

495
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:35,180
Uh, and between the two of them, they're watching out for the welfare of

496
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:40,300
the students involved, not just, um, you know, working them to death and, and

497
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,700
focusing on the goals, but also focusing on them as people.

498
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,900
And that is something that I was kind of proud of modeling in the book was a more,

499
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,420
you know, people centric development environment.

500
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:57,550
Yeah.

501
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,150
Very cool.

502
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,750
Like it definitely came across.

503
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,830
So, uh, you missed it before you logged in.

504
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,290
Uh, as you know, I've read the book, but Brent, uh, you

505
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,050
say you have, you have a copy for your daughter.

506
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,810
She hasn't read yet.

507
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,370
Is that correct?

508
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,830
Oh yeah.

509
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:20,090
Uh, yesterday I went up and looked up, um, uh, and, uh, downloaded it to my daughter's

510
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,630
Kindle.

511
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,490
She, she's awake yet.

512
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,450
Uh, so, or she's awake now.

513
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,050
Um, but so she hasn't looked at her Kindle because the first thing she does

514
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,170
is breakfast and then she goes, um, goes on the roadblocks.

515
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Yeah.

516
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,520
I, I, I will, we won't have it for today, but I look forward to hearing her reaction.

517
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,000
Uh, I'll share it.

518
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,840
I'll share it.

519
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,320
Um, and it's nothing else.

520
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,600
Uh, I'll, I'll send whatever feedback to you directly soon.

521
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,680
Yeah.

522
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,760
It's a fun read.

523
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:57,520
And also I see from your website, there's some positive reviews coming in.

524
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,080
Uh, I won't ask you to say to share your sales information, but I hope the

525
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,360
book is going well because well, actually, let me ask.

526
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,880
It this way.

527
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:14,430
We'll where are we at right now with the, the concept of maybe having a book too?

528
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,630
Um, I would, I would love to make a book to happen.

529
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:27,270
Uh, at the moment I'm spending my time focusing on trying to, uh, do a

530
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:33,230
good job with book one, you know, uh, I sent out feelers to get help from all

531
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,190
from people and all sorts of things like libraries I should talk to about

532
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,870
carrying the book and youth organizations.

533
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,670
I should donate copies to things like that.

534
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,550
And I haven't followed up on all of those things yet.

535
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:52,790
So I'm trying to complete my mission on book one before getting started on book two.

536
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,710
Understood.

537
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,670
Yeah.

538
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,910
I would love to.

539
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:02,070
Um, I just have to, uh, I don't know, convince myself that it's worth it.

540
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,590
And the number of people that I'll reach, but you know, the funny thing is like

541
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,870
the best way to market book one is to have a book two, right?

542
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,710
Uh, the best way to get more readers is to keep writing.

543
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,270
And so we'll see.

544
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,790
I would love to make it happen.

545
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,030
I just have to justify the expense.

546
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,070
You know, I have to be asking people to donate to another Kickstarter.

547
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,670
And, um, the time wasn't really that bad on my part.

548
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,590
So.

549
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,990
Do you have plenty more ideas?

550
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,070
Do you have more ideas?

551
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,510
Do you have, do you have additional plots and technical problem solving things?

552
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,750
I actually have another plot that I like even better than the first book.

553
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,940
So, so exciting.

554
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,660
I like it enough that I kind of want it to be book three, but I have to come up

555
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,740
with another idea for you have to find your empire strikes back to go in the

556
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,140
middle.

557
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,060
Yeah.

558
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:10,120
You should lead with, uh, uh, that last statement, um, as you try to succeed

559
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,480
in your mission on with Raven, right?

560
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,120
And that might be enough to say, to inspire your audience.

561
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,840
Oh, if we could just push Sue over that boundary, we'll, we'll get that paper.

562
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,080
Yeah.

563
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,880
Well, um, yeah, if you want to help support it, then buy books

564
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,320
for the young folks in your life.

565
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,100
So, you know, just kind of encourage them to think about themselves in a software

566
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:44,000
career, how have you been, uh, how have you been surviving during COVID quarantine?

567
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,760
How's the big going for you Sue?

568
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,740
It's been good.

569
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,420
Actually.

570
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:55,100
So, uh, we've had a nanny watching our kids ever since we had kids and, uh, our

571
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,940
nanny has still been coming every day to watch them.

572
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,460
So unlike many parents with young kids, it hasn't been that hard on us, uh,

573
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,140
during the day we can, uh, have a pretty normal work day.

574
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,740
So overall, if anything, I'm working too much and need to find

575
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,300
better ways to set boundaries.

576
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,700
I've heard that before too.

577
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,460
Yeah.

578
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,040
It's, it's definitely, you know, I was working from home most days before

579
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,020
because none of the teams, none of my team is in the Seattle area.

580
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,100
They're all in San Francisco and, uh, UK and Helsinki and maybe, and maybe

581
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:39,620
a few other places, so it's just been getting used to, uh, just getting used

582
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,700
to them all being home to Brent.

583
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:47,960
On the other hand is, have you just blown up yet or, or what's, are you

584
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,400
survive, are you getting any better at handling this Brent?

585
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,800
No, no, it is.

586
00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:05,650
It, it is absolutely thankfully it's slow, but it is absolutely a steady,

587
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,450
consistent decline.

588
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:14,510
I can't predict when I'm going to go crazy, but I can, I can feel it every

589
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,890
single day getting closer and closer and closer.

590
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:26,310
Uh, however, I think I understand now the primary cause, um, uh, last week

591
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:32,470
we had a meeting free day and I was completely recharged.

592
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:38,510
I'm like, ah, a day where no fricking PM can spontaneously set up a 30

593
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,250
minute meeting on my calendar.

594
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,750
Oh, fantastic.

595
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,510
Uh, and that's all I got things done.

596
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:50,710
Um, so the, the, the, I don't think it's the working from home so much as

597
00:38:50,750 --> 00:39:00,210
working from home is, is inspiring far too much time on my calendar spent

598
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:06,530
talking and not enough doing in that, that, that lack of balance is, is

599
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,690
driving me insane today.

600
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,850
In fact, unfortunately I overslept, but today my half hour meetings

601
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,530
were supposed to start at six, six in the morning.

602
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,450
Uh, they don't end till 5 PM and it literally is back to back to back to

603
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,930
back all the way through lunch, half hour meetings.

604
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,690
Uh, everyone asked me for status.

605
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,510
So bad plot ideas for the Raven series, a whole book where they can't

606
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,150
save the world because they're too busy in meetings all day.

607
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,630
No, no, no.

608
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,830
But you know, if you want your villain, you know, that could be the, the,

609
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,910
um, the origination story for the village.

610
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,150
Crazy because of it.

611
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh my well, Sue, it's, uh, it's been really fun having you on the podcast.

612
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,840
Thanks for doing this.

613
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,200
I, I, I saw the, I missed the kick and I, if there's another kickstarter

614
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,720
for book two, I will be part of the support for that.

615
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,680
I, I missed seeing a kickstarter the first time, but I did see on LinkedIn,

616
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,840
I said, wait, I know this person and that was like a cool idea.

617
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,560
And I got the book right away and it's a good read.

618
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,400
And so for anyone listening, I read it for yourself, read it for your family or

619
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,800
get it for your family, get it for your kids, get it for your friends, kids.

620
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,640
Uh, let's get the word out because not only is it, is the premise behind

621
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,400
your evil plan to save the world.

622
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,120
Really, really cool.

623
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,560
Uh, but you ended up with a really nice product.

624
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,680
You, you solve the problem very well.

625
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,720
You saw a problem.

626
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,320
You said, I'm going to do this.

627
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,960
And your solution for that problem was just, it's, I think it's fantastic.

628
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,440
So, uh, I will put when I post this on Monday, I'll have links to both your

629
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,960
evil plan to save the world and, uh, links to, I don't know.

630
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,240
I can't, I can't decide if we're hating Amazon or not right now.

631
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,440
I can do an Amazon link, but, uh, whatever, whatever other link to everything.

632
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:05,960
Yeah.

633
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,760
I will, I will look at your site and see whatever links you have to whatever

634
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,400
bookstores are around, but definitely worth checking out.

635
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,680
And, uh, any, any final words from you, uh, Brent or Sue before we close for today?

636
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, one thing I want to call out is, uh, with, with this, with Sue, I

637
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,580
don't know that we went into her evil plan sufficiently enough, but she's

638
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:35,420
trying to spread the word, uh, like we talked a great deal around getting

639
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:41,020
girls to code, um, that's a big part of it up on Kindle right now.

640
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,700
Uh, it's 99 cents.

641
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,220
It's she's, she's not just like with this podcast.

642
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,660
Sue is not doing this, uh, to, to get rich.

643
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:57,100
It's just, it's to share and spread a message and, and to try to change how we,

644
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:02,180
uh, impact interest into the tech and sciences.

645
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,260
Um, I believe, tell me where I'm going.

646
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,380
Yeah.

647
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:06,900
Yeah.

648
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,380
No, I, I priced it absolutely as low as I could.

649
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,900
Um, any money I make off of it, I'm going to donate.

650
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:22,660
So, um, it's, it's all about trying to, uh, change people's perceptions about

651
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,900
jobs and software, and in fact, I've put in enough money.

652
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,940
I'm never going to break even.

653
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,820
And that's fine.

654
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:35,060
Uh, the other thing I'm doing, uh, lately, uh, since the social

655
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:40,700
unrest that's been happening is I started to try supporting black authors.

656
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:46,020
There's a community amount around the self publishing industry that I got

657
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,740
in involved in, and I volunteered there that I would read and review

658
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,460
books by black authors.

659
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,820
And I've been posting book reviews on my evil plan to save the world.

660
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,500
So another way people can help is just go look at the book reviews.

661
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,140
And if there are any books that look good, go buy them from these authors.

662
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,780
So.

663
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,760
I would love to continue with that, by the way, as I keep going, when I

664
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,440
finished this first round of books that I've committed to read and review, I'm

665
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,280
going to keep going with books, uh, any books that promote diversity in STEM

666
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,680
and tech, so just keep a look there.

667
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,380
It's beginning to sound like your evil plan to save the world.

668
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,100
Isn't actually so evil,

669
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,300
but it makes it more fun to call it that.

670
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,180
It does.

671
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,300
Uh, I'm, I'm massively impressed.

672
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,500
Thank you.

673
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,260
Thank you for having me.

674
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,620
Yeah.

675
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,420
Yeah.

676
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,540
Our pleasure again.

677
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,500
It's good to catch up with you.

678
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,820
It's only been 15 years, but, uh, uh, it's, it's great to talk to you

679
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,940
again and hear you've been up to and just congratulations on, on doing such a.

680
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,980
I'm doing what you've been doing.

681
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,260
It's it's, it's, it's just really impressive for me.

682
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,620
I'm, I'm, I'm really in awe.

683
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,260
So thank you.

684
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,260
Thank you.

685
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,420
It's been fun.

686
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,420
Okay.

687
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,020
Well, thanks.

688
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:11,900
Uh, please everyone check, check out everything Sue talked about and, uh, and

689
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,060
let's do this support more diversity in tech, uh, more actually, I shouldn't say

690
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,420
in tech, let's just support diversity everywhere.

691
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:18,940
All right.

692
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,380
Gosh, seems so easy.

693
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:22,490
All right.

694
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,290
Uh, thank you again, Sue.

695
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,010
