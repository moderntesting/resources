00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:23,410
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey Brett hey Alan it's a

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,010
podcast time is it I've pressed early I've pressed all the appropriate buttons

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:42,260
I think you were clipping a little and now we can go hey never mind going fine

6
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,980
it's always interesting and and you know how you get a bias when you have some

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,580
knowledge about something and you assume that everyone has the at least basic

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,340
knowledge of what you're talking about yes like I can fake it with statistics

9
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,740
you've heard me fake it I have you cannot fake it with audio no there's

10
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,300
probably some things like you do is it is it jujitsu which martial art do you do

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,380
take one though take one though sorry I know nothing you could talk to I have

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,340
zero knowledge there's no basic knowledge other than I can sort of

13
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,820
pronounce Taekwondo you did that quite well thank you very much

14
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,620
so I didn't do it well so you're saying you got two out of the three words

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,140
correct welcome to the A B testing podcast where Alan and Brent were the A

16
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,020
and B and A B testing will guide you through whatever as you can tell comes

17
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:51,900
to mind right so perhaps semantics so shall we get on with the what's what's

18
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,460
going on should we do topics right away and freak people out some people just

19
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,220
skip through the first 10 minutes of the podcast waiting for us talking about

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:09,870
something interesting yeah yeah so I took a brief trip to Sweden I saw you saw me

21
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,830
in Sweden I saw a video of you in Sweden oh oh you want that I only watched the

22
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:24,320
first half of it because at the same time we had I think his name is yao yao

23
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:32,320
do a presentation I don't know there's the the three least two of the three oh

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,720
the 343 podcast you did with Dave lots going on in the world of A B testing

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,600
it's like a whole corporation no for sure except we the we don't make any

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,160
money and I'm I'm sure the surprises you I am vastly more interested in what

27
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,840
the three have to say than what you do yes you should you should and so I went

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:06,060
to or dev and in Sweden flew into Copenhagen took the train probably one

29
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,820
of the best run conferences ever I bet that I've been to this is a devops this

30
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,820
is your first DevOps it's not a dev it's a developer conference okay there was a

31
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,500
testing track but the testing and quality track but there weren't really

32
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,760
many testers there but let me get there quality the number of speakers the

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,880
quality of speakers it is a huge conference imagine I don't know how

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,080
many people were there but my room had a hundred ish people in the testing

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,130
quality track people like like Jez humble you know Jez one of the authors

36
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:45,250
of accelerate and the author oh yes absolutely he was also a speaker there

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,620
a track speaker okay so on the day of my talk I showed up early outside go I'll

38
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,020
go to the keynote I'll check out my room first make sure I know what it looks

39
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,340
like I'll go to the keynote I go to the keynote I'm going I hadn't looked at

40
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,700
the really looked at the program in advance I wonder who they got here and

41
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,940
what they're gonna talk about and I don't know if you were ever read the

42
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:11,660
book everybody lies good book on data he oh wait this is the author that did

43
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,940
a whole bunch of when Google made their search data public he did a massive

44
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,980
amount of research and found really really high correlation between search

45
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,900
for racial racially derogatory terms and Trump voters found out that far more

46
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,620
people search for porn that admit minute anyway he was the morning

47
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,260
keynote speaker okay so that I have not read it but that is one of the many

48
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,980
books that I have purchased and is sitting in a stack that I'm hoping to

49
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,940
absorb the knowledge through osmosis brief tangent I also have this problem

50
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,140
of buying books that I don't get to read I've been I was really good for a

51
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,220
long time a little bad right now about four or five behind not too bad one

52
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,620
thing I've started to do to rather than buy the book but to hold a

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,940
placeholder for it is I do like the Kindle thing where I haven't sent me

54
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,820
the first chapter for free and that's sort of the placeholder when I'm around

55
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,140
this is I can read this chapter maybe but maybe by the time I actually get

56
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,580
around to reading it may not be relevant anymore so that's my new plan oh

57
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,980
so you so you load the first chapter in your Kindle it's sort of a placeholder

58
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,180
and it ends up being like a to-do list yes exactly right and then you go oh

59
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:38,380
and if I ever actually read chapter one yeah I like this strategy so that that's

60
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,180
what I do anyway or dev great conference I had a good time with my

61
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,460
talk the recordings available I watched part of it I've never really watched my

62
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,520
speaking much but I actually I'm curious what people have to say about it

63
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:04,010
because I created a presentation where I would I was planning to adapt it

64
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,110
depending on the audience and their experience so if I were to give a talk

65
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,590
on modern testing principles and and how they've been used to the three I would

66
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,790
go a lot I would not go much into explaining the principles but I would

67
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:26,150
dive into all kinds of examples and examine some of the controversy and go

68
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:32,830
on and on and on in this room there were maybe one or two people that had

69
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,630
heard of the modern testing principles so now we have more people to know

70
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:45,080
about them there's also maybe 90 plus percent of the audience were developers

71
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:55,250
and what I found is the development audience were very very accepting of

72
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,650
modern testing principles because they're not that much about testing or modern

73
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,850
and you didn't get to the end but one I'm just gonna get I'm gonna get one

74
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,490
little spoiler because somebody asked and the inevitable question should

75
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,570
testers be able to code and where Brent would say yes I said it certainly helps

76
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:25,370
and and then I elaborated as I do and I said something something to the effect

77
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,890
of and they should but if you know how to code you can use that to write tools

78
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,260
to help you do testing I wouldn't spend that time writing automation and then

79
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:40,130
the next person said I have a question did you just say did you just say testers

80
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:48,410
shouldn't write automation and my answer was yes that is correct but I'll

81
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:56,570
elaborate because now I know you want me to but it was it was perfectly set up I

82
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:02,450
love that question anyway good conference I ended up I went to a big chunk of the

83
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,810
conference on Friday the day I presented also I arrived on Wednesday didn't go to

84
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,770
anything out there too late Thursday I went to a few talks ended up working a

85
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,870
lot from my hotel room had a bunch of stuff going on one other tangent is

86
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:24,680
Netflix does not have Brooklyn 99 in the US okay but every time I go out of

87
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,440
the country it's available on Netflix for me to watch so I watched a lot of

88
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,600
Brooklyn 99 from my room and then I downloaded a bunch to watch on the

89
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,160
plane on the way back I can still watch the downloaded ones that I downloaded in

90
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,400
Europe but I can't download anymore while I'm here so it's like I have to

91
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,480
drive to Canada or something why is I don't know licensing deals I'm not

92
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:53,760
involved in Brooklyn I'm not involved in Amazon's licensing deals Netflix Amazon

93
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:02,130
whatever it's a it's a fluid download thing also of interest is Disney Plus

94
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:08,500
are you signing up for that no I'm not neither am I and I've heard and I've

95
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,580
heard it matter it really I've heard it said kind of a hot mess I think it'll be

96
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,960
a matter of time before I will feel obligated I'm not sure I will ever feel

97
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,650
obligated for that so I'll just I'll just ask one question yeah Marvel or DC

98
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,410
Marvel right and I think that closes it eventually yeah but what if I already

99
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,820
own all the DVDs yeah even then that doesn't block it five ten years from

100
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,340
now they'll be like a way for you to play your DVDs you're right and actually

101
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,860
I own digital copies most of those but anyway one thing was interesting I want

102
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,660
to elaborate on one point before we get back into our topic that was last

103
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,600
week's topic that failed is I mentioned the audience for my talk was mostly

104
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,080
developers and I talked quite a bit with one of the conference coordinators after

105
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,060
my talk about how two points to make I have two points to make and then we'll

106
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,260
go on to our topic no I actually I think this is an interesting topic

107
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,980
right there's there's a lot of movement in this is the first time to

108
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,990
my knowledge that you've presented this to primarily a dev audience and one

109
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:28,860
observation there and then I the first observation was is the controversy in

110
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,780
the principles is much less so there to an audience of developers of a lot more

111
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,660
head nods in fact anecdotally when I've even at testing conferences people to go

112
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,260
thanks for giving a name to what I already do those people are primarily

113
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,020
developer type roles anyway with a little bit of quality background maybe

114
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,220
remember when we wrote the principles without the one that would cause the

115
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,560
biggest uproar is one more we say where the testing role may be eliminated oh my

116
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,340
god my livelihood you're ruining the craft but I feel like we've been able

117
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:08,650
to talk about that one quite well and people have they get it they go yeah I

118
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:14,090
can I can picture that world what has been more controversial at a lot of

119
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,560
talks about this at the conference was principle number five where we say that

120
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,900
only the customer is able to evaluate the quality of our product and we take a

121
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,640
lot of everything from you just expect the customers to do all your testing

122
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:38,900
because you're lazy or my customers special or whatever flavors of those you

123
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,460
want I still believe that now we can is worth talking about a little bit

124
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,460
because we do take not only a lot but continued grief people come across this

125
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:56,080
one it really triggers a lot of people and they make some arguments which I I

126
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,800
kind of see where they're coming from but they're also in some cases getting

127
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,630
lost in the semantics of the customer as a software developers it's off for a

128
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,710
team I want to make software that helps help someone do something better that

129
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,910
person I'm helping or something easier remember customers don't want software

130
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,870
they want their problem solved right I want to help people solve their problems

131
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,750
help people do things they couldn't do before help people do things more

132
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,430
easily than they could do before help people get their eyes opened up to new

133
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,150
things they could they didn't even think they knew they could do those people are

134
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:43,260
my customers so let's say for example I am the team building software for a

135
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,840
medical device that well we've had some famous bugs with x-ray machines I say I'm

136
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,920
building a software for automated collection of and dosage of an x-ray

137
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:03,100
machine for various uses who is my customer person that's impacted person

138
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,100
being x-rayed the person using the device so I can have multiple customers

139
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,140
the doctor the hospital may be the one that buys the device for me but I think I

140
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,900
believe my customer is anyone it's the person's his problem is being solved

141
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,980
which is it can be a multi-layered customer well in that case right so I

142
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:29,980
and correct me if you disagree I'm just I believe it's yeah that would be no

143
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,980
concerns there Alan so if you think about it from from a two-pronged approach

144
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,140
an x-ray we don't want to just a simple thing we don't want to over irradiate

145
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,820
our clients yeah because that would be bad they would die right but what's the

146
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,170
reason why they're getting an x-ray they're having a problem right okay

147
00:13:52,170 --> 00:14:00,510
purpose of an x-ray is diagnostics yes tool it's it so with you so far the

148
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:08,300
the person under study is a key customer here as well as the person who's using

149
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:18,650
the tool to do diagnostics is is a customer as you know I broke broke a bone

150
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,970
in my foot recently it's still not entirely healed it's one of these slow

151
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:30,350
breaks but it's a lot of work for for the doctor to go what the hell's wrong

152
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,350
particularly if it's a fracture right could you there's a be a different

153
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:40,470
treatment for a sprain strain ligament versus a bone fracture and the and the

154
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,470
amount of the fracture etc yeah you need to know what's going on so if they can

155
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:54,170
produce a higher confidence diagnosis faster then that that x-ray versus say

156
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,730
traditional x-ray devices is going to be a preferred one and also I want to dive

157
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,810
into this little bit so there's there's value in we all get everyone gets the

158
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:10,090
value in the in the diagnostic software but also the software we create should

159
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:15,700
do no harm that sounds a little bit too much like Google it should not the the

160
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:23,300
the side effects the the it shouldn't have unintended consequences that detract

161
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:32,540
from the value it should so who values an ethics yes so who evaluates the quality

162
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:39,640
of that other consumers I don't know I'm trying to come up with a new version

163
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,640
yeah what I've discovered so here's the thing I'm gonna take an aside that's

164
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:54,060
actually relevant but maybe an aside I'm not surprised that dev audience was like

165
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:00,990
wait why are you setting up here telling me things I already know right but and

166
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:07,870
that's hyperbole it is because I I I do weave some stories in and I want to go

167
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,480
actually I'll go back to that in a minute but go ahead and go on a lot of

168
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:21,160
my portion of developing MMT came from my own personal experiences like helping

169
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:29,160
moving to unified engineering right I was ahead of a dev team and we've

170
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,520
recorded this several years ago or where I spent a lot of time I had left tests

171
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,330
and I said okay now why would I bring a tester back into the system what

172
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:48,730
value would they add and I realized would have caused more harm than good

173
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,480
having a specialist in right I had a smooth running Kanban system I had a

174
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:05,410
process with dealing with very rapidly errors in production there wasn't a value

175
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:12,990
for me in a test specialist at that point in time and thinking about from

176
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:20,730
from a dev perspective I find it interesting when I go and talk to dev I

177
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,170
don't have these semantic discussions I don't have to clarify what is quality I

178
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,010
don't have to clarify what is customer and and I'm trying to in my head going

179
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:40,450
what does that mean what is that it like there's there's definitely a key culture

180
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,970
difference between a dev specialist community and a test special there is

181
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,780
there is and that just got me thinking of an epiphany that immediately blew out

182
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,380
of my head because I was thinking about too many things at once yeah it's

183
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,900
it is and I am super old I'm about to have a birthday congrats I'll be a hundred

184
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:09,410
years old I don't think that's true not quite I'll still be in double digits no

185
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:16,810
but times ticking for me March 5-0 oh yeah I remember that one so I was really

186
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:22,060
drunk so I want to back up and then move on I kind of put a cap on the

187
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:30,200
maybe a temporary cap a trial close on the principle 5 controversy I think I

188
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,580
truly believe and I and I still I believe people I hear arguments all the

189
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,060
time and how we're and against it all the time I still truly believe that is

190
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:46,660
not only a valid principle and worded correctly but one of the most important

191
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,420
principles nuts pretty much I mean that's stolen from a chapter of Reese's

192
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:57,060
book I think five and one are the two most important it's you don't get value

193
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,100
from your engineering effort in touch in the hands of customers and even with an

194
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,020
x-ray machine I may find building an x-ray software I may give the doctors

195
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,380
the soft before it even actually hooks up to the x-ray machine to make sure

196
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,210
that I may give them the software a prototype that does doesn't do the

197
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,970
x-ray but so they can use the software and it'll have mock-ups for example of

198
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,290
how it may give the feedbacks to make sure they understand how to use it that

199
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,170
using is intuitive and then the way they use it is the way that I thought they

200
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,650
would use it so I can adjust as needed I may do all fun developing this x-ray

201
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,770
software I may do all that work so I can get that customer feedback before I

202
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,780
actually start implementing the the hairy x-ray part yeah absolutely I

203
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,700
think it'd be a great way to do that a lot of the things and we could go

204
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,020
back to how about the software for an airplane that fails and causes it to

205
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,860
I would put that in a massive amount of simulations with pilots and well before

206
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,780
I put that in the plane no I think I think on the on the the quality

207
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,660
discussion there's a couple of thoughts right number one going back to briefly

208
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,140
back to this difference between the tests and dev culture right I remember

209
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:17,020
when I went from test to dev with a strong passion around quality I felt

210
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:26,180
oh oh my god I am a lot closer to the customer I can now actually influence

211
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:34,620
quality which leads me to and fully agree and that leads me to the second big

212
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,180
takeaway and this came up in my conversation with the conference

213
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,020
organizer after the talk as well which tied into my observations at the

214
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,020
conference which have tied into my observations and you know when you

215
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,420
reflect on years you go oh my god you have a revelation you go how is I so

216
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,300
stupid they never get to this before you've been on the channel you've heard

217
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,500
me talk about this and I mentioned it to a few people internally but I am

218
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:08,140
realizing that DevOps whatever it is is it a culture is it a role in my five for

219
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,380
Friday last week I pointed to a podcast that talked about it and what's

220
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,340
interesting in this coding blocks podcast I I would say I put the link

221
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,100
in the show notes but I'll forget look up coding blocks and find it they talk

222
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,620
about DevOps it is haunting when they talk about DevOps how much it sounds

223
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,420
like testing and how much they talk about specialists really just want

224
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,220
someone with us but that specialty you don't want to have a DevOps team and

225
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,500
going oh my god and not just that point but points over and over and over

226
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,260
and over and I'm realizing that as far as accelerating the delivery of

227
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,660
customer value or accelerating the achievement shipable quality DevOps has

228
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,060
far more to do with that and or an infrastructure team working on

229
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,860
accelerating the team in way in safe way in ways that ensure safety and quality

230
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:05,970
is a farm hands down far better way to do that than QA oh and I ran and talk

231
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,450
about bringing the quality perspective to a product team when I was at

232
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,730
Microsoft on teams my last project there I was hired as the quality guy at the

233
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,170
quality coach and then I had a manager who was kind of a dick and it kept on

234
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:27,370
yelling at me every time there was a bug and it's like Jesus this is 1990 2015

235
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:33,250
2016 but I ended up taking over all of the infrastructure team everything from

236
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,530
developer desktop to customer deployment and that gave me a lot more control I

237
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:44,490
got yelled at a lot less still wasn't super happy but it worked so since then

238
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:50,470
I you sacrificed you sacrifice something I can't put a finger on it for autonomy

239
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:57,230
maybe but let's move on because that was that was a good learning experience for

240
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,590
me and more learning in retrospect I but that was I actually also managed a lot

241
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,900
of offshore testers so it wasn't wasn't the best experience so let me move on

242
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,460
to my current role at Unity and we'll we'll splash back and forth between

243
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,260
hold on I'm not done with the last topic no no no we're we're easing in here

244
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,740
we're gonna go back it's gonna it's gonna we go ahead that's great there's I

245
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,020
keep in the back of my head I keep thinking about the experience and this

246
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,100
difference man I do think there's something important there and it occurs

247
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:37,180
to me like hey Ellen do you think testers should code no yeah I'm actually

248
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:45,580
gonna change that and you said Brent will say yes and I'm gonna say and when

249
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:52,490
Alan said that he was right but I'm gonna I'm gonna change it now because I'm

250
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:02,430
actually now wondering if Tess can really understand quality from the outside

251
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:10,200
meaning in a and when I think through processes you and the listener should be

252
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:18,300
aware that at first I go to the extremes when I went from test to dev that shift

253
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:28,650
was very much going from theoretical to actual previously I stood on principle I

254
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:35,460
stood on theory I said things like what you want the customer to do your testing

255
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,260
for you needed and right we had an episode we had this whole conversation

256
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:47,680
when I was in a dev role the accountability the responsibility was on

257
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:57,240
me to prove to to provide value so I'm gonna say yeah test should code but even

258
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,020
further they should get on a feet they should be coding a feature see I don't

259
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:10,240
fully agree I think there's so I think the the path for a quality specialist

260
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:18,700
to be effective as and an impactful on a software team is not to specialize

261
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:26,580
solely in testing but the paths they can go into are wide and I think I have

262
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,860
found I don't think we disagree but you said feature and I think this dev ops

263
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:41,780
this infrastructure role is a very common path for testers I think whatever

264
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:47,580
so we both agree they should we want specializing generalists not

265
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:55,510
specialists yes okay what I'm proposing because there's one commonality that

266
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:04,170
occurs to me for both you and I we both coded features yes we have right it

267
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:09,390
doesn't have to be a big one so this testing specialist that I'm talking about

268
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:19,420
could they be assigned a small feature and be an own that in the end just

269
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,450
for the experience yeah that's exactly I'm not I'm not against it I don't think

270
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:31,240
it's a requirement I think it's a good idea yeah I'm trying to come up with what

271
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:38,300
is the key thing is that we have to de-theorize the testing specialist

272
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:45,370
position yes that's it theory always breaks apart in the face of reality

273
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,940
right there's a lot of thought experiments there and yeah and all right

274
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,460
I'm done now my the modern testing course on ministry of test there's a

275
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,210
lot of thought experiments there like in episode 7 one of the exercises is what

276
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,930
would need to change on your team in order for it in order for testers not to

277
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:10,290
meet it just think through it just just not saying quit must think get

278
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,690
yourself fired so just think about what would need to change maybe the list is

279
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,790
huge maybe it's short just think about yeah there's a lot a lot of theory

280
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:25,030
there so now this will still tie into my point from earlier is I've been

281
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:30,710
thinking about this move to DevOps and what people do and I have a small I

282
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:37,640
wouldn't call it a QA team so I have one I have two people who on my team

283
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:45,480
former testers okay one of former lead very experienced knows how to code super

284
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:54,460
smart guy he is basically functioning as a test coach for a huge part of the

285
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:04,550
organization what I found is that our developers do pretty much 100% I'll say

286
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:13,900
95% of the testing they know how to do which is that's a that's a greater amount

287
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:20,100
of testing than maybe they knew how to do six months ago but not probably still

288
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,580
not enough so having someone there who has that breadth of experience to just

289
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,300
think about new ideas have you thought about this should we try this has been

290
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,980
really really helpful also at the same time he's he's sort of half in a DevOps

291
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,300
role and I would consider him part of the DevOps team but he just happens to

292
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:47,340
some quality coaching and in fact I would view him as longer term as DevOps

293
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,180
but he has the testing expertise so he's gonna end up coaching there we've

294
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,420
talked before about this were just like you have a database expert or

295
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,540
performance expert or a front-end expert or a react expert having someone

296
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:05,300
with some experience and expertise in testing is a good value add for the team

297
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,620
but being a total specialist of being a bottleneck is not a good idea so I had

298
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,700
an interesting we added one more person to my team through acquisition

299
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,380
acquired a small company they had one QA person but it's interesting how much

300
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:29,180
it's weird when you have a manager who is not like me at all but we tend and we

301
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,820
get we get to our conclusions from different angles but we agree our

302
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:40,480
philosophies are highly aligned and I'm not sure how or why because we came from

303
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,440
different directions and backgrounds but interesting conversation he asked about

304
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,760
this person QA person in the New York he didn't use these words but I think at

305
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,680
first he was worried there were more of a traditional QA and I'm gonna I'll

306
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,480
paraphrase the whole conversation but basically I think what he wanted to find

307
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,400
out is could this person be it be a test coach like the other person on my

308
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,740
team okay and the answer is yes but it made me think more about people with

309
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,980
test expertise in modern testing growing in the test coach roles or test

310
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,890
consultant roles and I realized one thing that a skill that I've been

311
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,290
working on but an interesting thing is there's a level above it where I need to

312
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:31,380
one area where I want to get better it as coaching coaches when I rely on

313
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,340
coaching from my team so much that makes me realize that I need to and how

314
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:45,540
to coach coaches right yeah I have a similar problem and it's essentially have

315
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:53,540
I ever shared the definition of empowerment please do so Brent

316
00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:03,640
empowerment is trust that the person that you're empowering will make the same

317
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:10,600
decision you will in your absence I think I've heard that before yeah I am

318
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:20,100
spending time empowering coaches I'll use the term coaches in this context on

319
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:29,690
my team in order to scale right I need this I need more

320
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:39,560
guide ers in order to in order to take one of the key things that I'm doing

321
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:45,330
right now and have it go viral right right now it's bottlenecking behind me oh

322
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:51,350
bottlenecks are bad you should I want to get the coding blocks podcast again

323
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,350
because you got to listen to it you'll crack up they have a long conversation

324
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,230
they're talking about whether DevOps should be a role or a culture and I

325
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,430
and I believe it's a culture but that you may hire some DevOps folks to help

326
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:08,620
there and in the middle of that argument they had a nice long

327
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,340
discussion over where they don't want the DevOps team to be the only people

328
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,740
that do that stuff so that stuff bottlenecks on them sounds familiar huh

329
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,380
good strategy so it's very much I mean DevOps is very much a there's some

330
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:31,820
expertise around things like Kubernetes and Jenkins and CI systems but you want

331
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,660
to empower the teams around you to use those tools miss and come to you

332
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:42,460
when they need expertise to figure things out that whole role is at Unity at

333
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:50,780
least is a small team imagine so 200 engineers working on a very profitable

334
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:58,300
business and there are five people working on six people maybe working on

335
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,940
infrastructure and DevOps and tools so obviously a lot of it is them building

336
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:13,180
the base and the rest of the engineers absorbing their output one way to make

337
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,900
sure that team isn't a bottleneck is to not overstaff it because it's small

338
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,780
because it's because it could be a bottleneck make it so that if it were a

339
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,660
bottleneck it would be so painful to death to do something about it right

340
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,460
which is kind of like the way I actually I believe that's why basically

341
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,860
three people across these 200 plus engineers who have some testing

342
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,780
expertise with me being one of them make sure that we are not a bottleneck

343
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,980
or when I was a when I was the test guy the quality guy on teams I wasn't a

344
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,780
bottleneck because I was if I would have had a team of ten people who would

345
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,500
have been the testing bottleneck no but the other key thing is leadership and

346
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,860
in this case so I have seen teams with your same degree of staffing and the

347
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:12,810
same degree of power that you have go a different way it is just a flip of a

348
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:20,940
switch Ellen in your brain that makes this a coach model versus a command and

349
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,860
control right if you could just as easily take your three people and turn

350
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:33,350
this into command and control structure I suppose and with your background be able

351
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:38,030
to articulate it's the right thing for the business you and I both know it

352
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:47,620
wouldn't be I know but it's it's do you think it comes really comes down to that

353
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,060
flaw because I inherently believe in autonomy and giving people a framework

354
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,460
and getting out of their way and and coaching as a leadership style I would

355
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,060
argue that sort of attitude is becoming more and more prevalent among tech

356
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:08,850
leadership I think it is and they and I think it's because I'll tell you when I

357
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:17,780
changed my mind accountability is an important thing and every person in

358
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,860
leadership role is going to have a different philosophy but they're all

359
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:30,210
accountable for something true some of us are risk-averse some of us are

360
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,770
that I don't know what the opposite of risk-averse is but take a damn the

361
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:43,600
torpedoes mentality when I when I went and I learned the Kanban model and I

362
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:54,310
learned that shipping small things faster continuously integrating getting

363
00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:01,700
that feedback loop so I can respond immediately if we screwed something up

364
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:14,100
not only was better in producing quality but also reduced risk right and true one

365
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:20,780
million percent true yeah and and so a lot of it comes out of the decision

366
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:28,740
making factor in in prior roles no we're shipping on this date right and so I had

367
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:37,300
to spin up risk mitigation mode to because again I was accountable for the

368
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:43,590
the risk that we shipped and the more that that loaded up the more time I

369
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:50,520
needed to be able to evaluate the risk and the more it further loaded up the

370
00:36:50,520 --> 00:37:01,560
more I lost confidence of my ability to evaluate the risk so when I learned and

371
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,860
when you're in that mode command and control is critical because you need to

372
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,780
make sure that somebody somewhere randomly doesn't do something that

373
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,180
completely changes that risk equation because you're already having a hard time

374
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:23,820
figuring out what it is right but with this other model I'm like oh yeah you

375
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,100
know what you think it's right Alan do it make sure you have a monitor make sure

376
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,700
it turns itself off within the first five minutes you realize you're wrong

377
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,820
just help people stumble towards success right so I want to tie this in we got

378
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:45,500
about 15 minutes left here to our oddly rambling discussion in the last podcast

379
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,420
and it was odd one of the three said they really really liked him we weren't

380
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:55,130
sure why but because we spent most time exploring my role at Unity the

381
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,330
conversation really got thrown for a loop because my official title on paper is

382
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,050
director of program management and there's a skew because Microsoft has a

383
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,810
odd view on what program managers are it's different from the industry and we

384
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,690
spent a lot of time just trying to clarify what that was so my title on

385
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:19,530
paper while works I want to reframe that around the discussion we just had so it

386
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,530
was so wouldn't help last week but I consider myself a delivery director or

387
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,210
delivery manager but then that sounds too much like your release manager you

388
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,610
you accuse me of being that's not quite it at all but then Percy reminded

389
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,410
us we had this conversation a year ago almost a year ago when I was thinking

390
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,140
about this job and you said Alan it sounds like you're a release train

391
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,620
engineer which is a term from the safe world and bread test safe training and

392
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:53,260
the definition the RTE the release train engineer facilitates the agile release

393
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,380
train or you know TM facilitates processes and execution escalates

394
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,180
impediments helps manage risk insurance value delivery and drives continuous

395
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:09,500
improvement or in short the RTE helps the team deliver and get better and

396
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,860
that's actually doesn't describe my entire job because I have some other

397
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:22,360
coaching aspects in there but that's largely what I do I try and I I try and

398
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,540
help the team learn from failures learn from mistakes and try to improve and

399
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:32,870
overall make sure we're getting value to customers actually the way I put it I

400
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:38,500
think I'm this last week I try and balance velocity and quality so under

401
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:45,500
that and that ties into what you were just talking about so does that and then

402
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,140
I'm gonna get into the question we never answered last week does that framing of

403
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,690
my job as release train engineer since you know that language does that help

404
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,850
you understand what I do what my responsibilities are yeah in the last

405
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:07,770
cast the topic was what what KPIs it wasn't really KPIs like as someone with

406
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:12,530
quality experience or as a quality leader in a release train engineer type role

407
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:18,050
I'm paraphrasing to fit better context this time what would be some things you

408
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,690
would do or I can't measure within there what would be some things that

409
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:27,290
you would do or measure along those lines yeah I've spent a lot of time

410
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:36,930
thinking about that and also thinking about this one witticism part of our job

411
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:42,810
what's a witticism word I made up okay just checking when we talk about

412
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:48,610
quality it occurs to me that a lot of the times it's getting overloaded oh yeah

413
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:54,250
right it's there's there's three words that I'm finding one of the definitions

414
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,210
of quality is a word that means 11 different things 10 different people well

415
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,010
the thing that's really interesting to me is that in the test community right

416
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:09,250
we've known that the only the only thing testers can agree on around the

417
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:16,570
definition of the word test is that it has four letters other than that there's

418
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:23,720
no agreement on what is test true but customer and quality are also

419
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,800
ambiguous apparently and we learned very recently that customer was ambiguous

420
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:37,390
I sure but in your role right it's two phases there are two aspects build the

421
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:46,620
right product build the product right cliche and cliche right so those yeah I'm

422
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,940
involved I'm involved in helping teams get better at that but I do also

423
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:56,260
partner quite a bit with both product managers and product marketing to build

424
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:01,340
the right product so let's go back engineers don't know how to build the

425
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,860
right product that's one thing need to be told how to do a lot of the time

426
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:10,850
right in decomposing that how do you how do you reduce the friction to tell

427
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:16,210
them what to do and most importantly so that they self-learn it so I had a

428
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,070
conversation and I should ease into this if we're different direction while

429
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:26,950
product marketing or product management may have a good idea based on what

430
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,310
they've done talked customers research whatever to figure out building the

431
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,270
right product we don't know that until only the customer can evaluate that

432
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:40,110
absolutely so it's all a bunch of hypotheses so that's where my role steps

433
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:45,110
is a great understand we're trying to build how can we what's our path to get

434
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:50,880
that feedback as soon as possible I had a conversation yesterday with with

435
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,160
someone at Unity I'm talking about a project that they said was a failure

436
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,510
that may not have been his words or may have been his words and expressed

437
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,750
disappointment yeah and I said so I was at a failure and he talked about things

438
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,670
and and blah blah blah blah blah end of story the product was a failure

439
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:15,470
because it was canceled or redirected or whatever and never really solved the

440
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,150
customer problem and I said let me rephrase that again so get rid of that

441
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:27,860
that face this product was a failure I want products to fail that's where we

442
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:32,380
get to learn but this product took three months to fail when I think we

443
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,990
think we could have made it fail in a month and that's that's that's what we

444
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:42,230
need to learn from I want products to fit I want us to reduce the time from

445
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,630
product hypothesis to customer impact customer feedback and if it takes if it

446
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:51,190
takes three months to figure out the building the wrong product that that is

447
00:43:51,190 --> 00:44:00,360
something to learn from I think it depends on what you're making but you

448
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:07,720
want to so here's a product idea blah one of the things I help teams discuss

449
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,520
and I think we're off the track here a little bit but we're not is what is our

450
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,880
path to figure out and this is the right product how are we gonna validate

451
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:23,960
this as soon as possible and what I'm finding is to the less experienced their

452
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:30,040
idea of the minimum viable product is much more expansive than what I think the

453
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:37,180
minimum viable product may be so that is a I haven't heard that discussed much

454
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:44,300
the far as how to make how to really identify the MVP because what I've seen

455
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,100
in practice is people call the minimum viable product something that I saw this

456
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,060
on I've seen this for years and years and years it's a certain definition we used to

457
00:44:53,060 --> 00:45:03,780
call beta yeah what they call the MVP is far far far more than minimum so one

458
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,940
thing and read and one of the three listeners can point with this exists

459
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:13,160
but one thing I've been working out a lot is helping teams narrow down their

460
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:20,500
definition of minimum and I haven't seen a lot of writing or I'm just thinking

461
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,020
a lot of the talk about this is something we that needs to be explored more is how

462
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:28,380
do you take what you think is minimum viable product and make it a truly

463
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,800
minimum viable product that's one aspect of my job from a strategy that's easy

464
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,440
we are all over the tangent world here I actually don't do you know this all

465
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,540
makes it's all connected I am briefly considering everything you just said and

466
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:50,100
go okay is this the next most important so for me it's easy a minimum viable

467
00:45:50,100 --> 00:46:00,420
product is the smallest thing you can ship where you gain the greatest amount

468
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:10,430
of knowledge around should you continue to work on this thing yes okay I have

469
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:15,830
had this particular conversation with multiple different people I always

470
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:20,830
bring up the Reese example because I think it's beautiful they had spent six

471
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:28,150
months and realized that they had spent one day building an advertising website

472
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:33,110
that said click here to download they didn't even have to implement the

473
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,750
download that it could have returned a 404 and they would have learned in one

474
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:47,300
day what took them many man-hours in six calendar months to learn yeah yes yes I

475
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,220
think it's and this has been true for my entire career in software I think

476
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:57,700
there's too much faith from developers that the customers will want the thing

477
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:03,260
they're building and we need to use customers and data to understand that do

478
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:08,700
you know who Stephen Blink is no Stephen Blink is was actually the

479
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,460
inspiration for Eric Reese he is a professor at Princeton he highly

480
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:21,850
recommended book four steps to the epiphany also I would link it but I'll

481
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:33,300
forget look it up he shared you know I paused there he shared if one of the

482
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:39,740
three if you just want to be an admin on the podcast website and and want to

483
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:45,300
go and happy to have it happen just gonna throw that out there anyway he

484
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:56,480
shared see now we're we're a B test coaches we're realizing that I'm the

485
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,880
bottleneck I'm right right I know I know my limitations so I'm looking to

486
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,680
delegate yeah yeah now I have to take a moment because I completely lost my

487
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,680
train of thought he shared no I got that part Stephen Blank shared inspiration

488
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:19,440
for Reese oh you're talking about developers great developers developers

489
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:29,520
developers so I happen to happen to go to a place where I saw Stephen Blink do a

490
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:37,560
talk and one of the phenomenons that he talked about was was venture capitalism

491
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:46,750
in Silicon Valley in that the culture had been changing and VCs had learned a

492
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:56,000
heuristic which is if this is a company trying to get additional income if they

493
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:09,820
had a head holy of sales already hired odds are we're going to say no why

494
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,760
because it was the head holy of sales let's say a VP of sales or VP of

495
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:23,740
marketing their primary job is to go talk to the customer now usually the

496
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:31,660
founder is the inventor and one of the problems with inventors and I'm going to

497
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:37,580
say this a problem exists with developers as well is the NIH phenomenon

498
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:45,180
we've talked about many times my idea is awesome and it is absolutely better than

499
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:52,040
yours if you have a VP of sales and they go out and they try to flight this

500
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:58,100
idea and they realize the customers don't want it let's say you're the the

501
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:06,750
CEO and you have this my shit don't stink and I'm the VP of sales and I say

502
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:14,700
Alan no one wants this idea right you have two choices reevaluate your belief

503
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:25,180
in that of your idea or reevaluate your belief whether or not I'm a competent VP

504
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:39,860
of sales long far longer story short VCs nowadays they want you the founder to

505
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:47,280
do the customer connection not a VP of sales because they have learned you

506
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:56,540
trying to hawk your wares to customers helps to you to get the feedback and

507
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:06,380
understand where you're wrong yes and an irrational belief of righteousness kills

508
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,140
startups yeah and but you see so much of that not in startups as well as within

509
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:16,020
companies I saw that Microsoft 150 million trillion times right and this

510
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:24,760
is why this is why I always take the term product requirements nowadays and I

511
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:34,520
change it to hypotheses yes I am I am trying to purposely make people realize

512
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,420
doesn't matter how important their belief is there's still a chance they're

513
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:45,860
wrong of course and the first thing we need to do is evaluate that as and many

514
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,300
textbooks talk about this the idea of falling in love with your ideas yeah and

515
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,260
I always fall back to and going back to customers don't want software they want

516
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,700
their problems solved and if you don't understand if you don't have at least

517
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,340
three different solutions to solve the problem you don't understand the problem

518
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:06,300
well enough that's from Weinberg slight paraphrase focus on that and realize I

519
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,860
mean here's it's a hypothesis you can understand the problem and go here's

520
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:17,960
my idea for a solution you get you get some feedback on it you either you

521
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:24,920
pivot or you persevere yeah I think about right just before you and I met

522
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:31,850
this morning I was staring at a report that one of my directs and I have

523
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:38,910
collaborated on and that whole report its whole purpose in life is to shine the

524
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:47,300
light on everything I can think about about why I'm wrong yes that's a good

525
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:53,190
way to look at it and that helps I think I've brought that up recently it might

526
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,310
have been in my in the course it might have been in the talk but I feel like

527
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:03,620
I've talked about that recently yeah prove the negative hypothesis yeah so

528
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:09,980
there's the the you want to you want to aggressively try to prove the negative

529
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:17,600
hypothesis and then hope you never do yeah sure and but what I find it's a

530
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,540
nice lens to put on that every time I actually prove the negative hypothesis is

531
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:29,300
hugely valuable in my role my currency is credibility yep right when I stand up in

532
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,300
front of a crowd and I have my data scientists hat on and I'm saying this is

533
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:41,040
what this is saying people are going to take action and and I don't want to come

534
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,600
back next month oh yeah remember when I told you that never mind yeah I'd

535
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,780
right when I'm doing a public presentation this is an aside that when

536
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:58,610
I'm doing a public presentation in data science mode it really hurts me because

537
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:06,970
I cannot allow my natural tendency towards hyperbole out that is dangerous

538
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:13,960
I think we've decomposed enough for discussion we will talk about continued

539
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:20,700
topics of whatever comes up in the world as we continue our path towards a yeah

540
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:27,510
we'll see ya we'll see ya oh my god soon I thought of something else I wanted to

541
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:32,150
mention earlier but then I forgot to bring it up so I thought about bringing

542
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:36,910
it out those at the clock I said no I'm not going to so that's all we're gonna

543
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:45,190
do today okay I am the master editor of this podcast and I am NOT all right

544
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:48,110
au revoir
