1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,800
Everybody hi, hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we're back again

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,300
For the a B testing podcast what episode are we on here?

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,500
Well, I actually had to look up that this time Alan and we're 16

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,140
You had to look it up because there's a number too big for you to count

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,400
It's too high for me to keep in my head. That's that's excellent

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,860
Excellent job there Brent and our first episode of 2015. Yes

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,800
Look at that. Hey, happy new year everyone. It is it spent a month

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,760
We took the holidays off and what you doing your holidays Brent? I

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,320
did

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
very proactively

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,500
Nothing. I was very forcibly doing nothing

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,020
It was fantastic

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,960
Wow, I'm impressed. I was hoping to draw a little bit more out of you. No, no

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,640
I did it was hard to do like family wanted to do things

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,520
Did no work. I'm on my couch work my lazy boy recliner

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,360
You know

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,560
I've actually thought about going out and buying a lazy boy recliner

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,720
We want to we want to upgrade the the our living chair

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,680
We want it well, we want to upgrade our living room, but that would have violated my principle of doing nothing

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,310
So it was fantastic. It was um, so we had a big release just before the holidays

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,230
Power bi is the the team I'm on we have now

22
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,360
several new features and

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Those features are all free. So if those who are interested in the the power bi space you can go create

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,880
use our new set of features and

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,200
Go create your own account for free and start messing around with power bi dashboards. It's a fantastic product

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,280
But it took a lot out of us to build it and so by I shut up

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Matter of fact, I had to do a password change

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:38,620
You know, you know how our past

29
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,500
Data with the bifurcation double ginger of the globe. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep. We can do that in a whole bunch more

30
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,260
That's awesome. I did a lot of junk and did nothing we didn't

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,060
Try well, gosh, we did travel. I ran a 12k

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,520
The 12k is a christmas run. I finished without puking. That was nice took me just over an hour

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
So I was happy with that

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Okay is five miles six miles eight miles eight miles. I was and in fact, it was so much fun

35
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,060
that I

36
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,740
In a fit of stupidity that I will sure i'll hate myself for later. I'm gonna do a half marathon in march

37
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,850
Um around this march this march around murse around

38
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,570
You have support staff?

39
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,650
No, you have my phone number. So if you

40
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,810
I'm eight miles in and i'm doing fine. I just need a beer. I got your back. Alan. I'll be right there

41
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,890
And then sort of on uh, we had a nice holiday at the house and

42
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,410
Sort of a little bit of a whim the wife and I

43
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,410
Took off on new year's day for a quick trip to vegas

44
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:52,450
Oh, we saw oh the night we got there next night. We went to the final show the justin timber lake tour

45
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,930
And then and flew back the next day. So are you a a beat a big jt fan? My wife is

46
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,810
It was a good show though. It was it was done really well, but I was listening to the radio the other day and he is

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,240
Uh last year he was the number one or number two

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,780
um

49
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,020
Number one artist in terms of bringing money in I believe it. Yeah, like like and he's funny too billion dollars

50
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,470
one bajillion

51
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,470
Um cool. All right. So

52
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,870
Those of you that haven't turned off the podcast yet

53
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,910
Let's actually talk about software and this week because we've been gone so long and we actually had some feedback

54
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,630
Let's go right. Wait

55
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,990
So so actually before we begin there's there's there's one shout out I wanted to do

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,270
Those who are listening to the podcast

57
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,750
uh as well as a

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,870
blog post

59
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,350
Um, you guys have known that i've gone back to to school and i've actually surprisingly i'm halfway done with it

60
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,520
Not really certain how where the time went

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,200
um

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
the but one of my

63
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,450
professors, uh

64
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,690
Uh just recently passed away

65
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,890
So I just want to basically shout out and say this this this man has been a key part of my

66
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,190
Uh personal growth towards my career trajectory

67
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,290
Very sad to see him go and I I really do hope that um

68
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,090
He rests in peace

69
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,090
It was actually very sudden. It was my my last class my last semester. He was my professor

70
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,050
And we were doing this conference call and he does a video call and he suddenly started coughing

71
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,450
And he and he mentioned just sort of uh at a hand that

72
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,850
He was gonna go see the doctor, uh the next day and

73
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,820
Turned out he ended up having uh lung cancer. He had never been a smoker. So it might have been a genetic version of it

74
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,410
And the word had been that he was coming back this next semester. Matter of fact the the class i'm taking now

75
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,890
He was supposed to teach. Uh, but um

76
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,330
January 8th, he passed on so

77
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,050
Uh professor, uh, if you are able to hear thanks

78
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,730
Uh, you have at least one student that appreciated what you did for him. Very cool. Yeah

79
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,530
Well, not cool, but thanks for the shout out. Yep

80
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,810
uh

81
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,810
so without further ado

82
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,090
Let's go right on to the

83
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Mail

84
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,650
Wow, that was fantastic, you know, I I work on these so yeah we have and

85
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,730
by definition

86
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,370
Obviously, no one sends regular mail anymore

87
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,970
So there's no mail bag and people don't even send us email and often they don't even actually most the time

88
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,970
They don't post any comments

89
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,410
On the blog site or on itunes or stitcher or wherever

90
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,400
they usually tweet

91
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,520
Random things in the hallway. So the mail bag for us is anything any sort of interaction you have with us is the mail bag

92
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,520
Yes, anything that we can spend a half a second

93
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,960
And turn into an interesting question is a mail bag and we appreciate it

94
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,550
And once again those youth haven't turned everything off although we did have actually a mail from um,

95
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,470
Jinsung

96
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,230
Oh internal this last time. So yeah, well that'll come up for that area

97
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,310
Yep, so first off I want to give a shout not a shout out a shout back

98
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,870
Uh, it's really cool. Um

99
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,590
Back in december just after our last podcast came out michael larson

100
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,750
Did a post on some of the podcasts he listens to and mentioned us pointing some people our way pretty cool

101
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,230
I think we were number one on the

102
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,610
I don't think it was I think it was alphabetical

103
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Number one

104
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,360
That's why we start with a we're a a a a a b testing. We are number one podcast

105
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,920
In the in the so so anyway in the category of culture change for software testers starting with

106
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Starting with the letter a

107
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:16,300
So so anyway, um, I got to meet michael four or five years ago at uh, um briefly at

108
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,460
Pnsqc conference down in portland and then i've been reading his blog for a long time

109
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,980
He did a great review of how he tests software at microsoft when it came out on his blog

110
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,940
But then just recently last month I had the blog post here so I can pull up the date here

111
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,860
Uh, he did a post on a on december 19th. No, that's actually the podcast one was on december 19

112
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,940
He did another post that i'm not going to look for right now, but but it was on

113
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,420
Now i'm gonna horribly paraphrase this but it's it's it's interesting

114
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,340
It was something like organizations of horror vacuum

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
and the story he told

116
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,320
was

117
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,480
Somebody at their company just left and they're the person owned all the vm stuff and he said well

118
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,800
I have some background there. I can I can jump in and

119
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,280
And sort of the moral being hey, you know, if there's stuff you can do go ahead and jump in which I fully believe in

120
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,040
So much so that it reminded me when I read it that the week before

121
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:19,150
There was some work that wasn't being done and and I love learning new things and jumping in on things and my superpower is I can learn

122
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,830
Things really quickly and I figured things out really well. So there was some work that needed to be done

123
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,440
And that'd be really interesting. So I lied I said, hey i've done something like that before I can help out

124
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I said, oh great and I I

125
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Did never done anything like it before but I knew I knew I could I knew I could learn it

126
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,200
It depends on how you abstract it. Yeah, I guess so i've worked on

127
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
products before yeah

128
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,040
I've i've

129
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Yeah, yeah, i've uh, i've read words in english before I can do this. Yes

130
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,120
Now I mean

131
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,480
There's a sense of fearlessness that actually alan and I both share

132
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,160
um

133
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,200
I think we've been testers for too long to believe that that code is is anything

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Even remotely resembling magic

135
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,400
It's just another bunch of lines of code put together to solve things

136
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,660
Yes, it's not hard to figure out what it does and how to make it do the right thing. It's hard for some people

137
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Not for me, it just takes diligence

138
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah

139
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,960
Anyway, I I related a lot to that because I did that all that post especially but from the recent ones because I that's exactly

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,480
What I do. So I

141
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
I like to

142
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,000
Uh, I like to be a generalist wait, which oh

143
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,520
Let's not let's not go there again. So anyway, thank you. Michael, uh his website

144
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,480
Uh mkl test head.com

145
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,000
Uh, and he's I believe mkl test head on twitter, but if i'm wrong, you probably already follow him

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,720
Anyway, so um, yep, I I I do follow, uh, michael and read his blog, uh quiet ops

147
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Cool. Yeah, he's a great he's great

148
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,400
All right, let's get into oh, oh twitter conversation was this from gear in norway?

149
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,680
About he thought it was we were talking about, you know, one-on-ones and coaching and mentoring and

151
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,560
He mentioned that in his workplace or in his culture

152
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,320
They the managers that just managers didn't do that

153
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah, the he he sent us a tweet and in his feedback was after listening to one of our podcasts

154
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:35,850
And I think it was some comment that I had made around um, the frequency in which I I talked through my guys

155
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,850
um

156
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,930
And he he found it, uh odd or befuddling i'm i'm i'm

157
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,570
paraphrasing here

158
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,570
uh to have management

159
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,770
that

160
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,210
syncs up with their employees on a weekly basis and in the even when as far as to say

161
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,550
uh

162
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:02,990
He found that like culturally odd like he was he was going to talk or ask around and see if any of any of his friends or co-workers

163
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,880
Experience such a phenomenon

164
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,300
All right. So what do you think?

165
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,640
I

166
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,800
The the opposite to you and I the opposite seems weird and it's not like you need and yeah

167
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,040
And this is one of those things where it's really easy to get the pendulum the wrong way and I see managers

168
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,640
who

169
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,560
Are so busy because they have these eight or nine direct reports

170
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,520
Want to meet with each of them for like an hour every week and sometimes the weird thing happens

171
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,400
Like we'll do an hour one-on-one a week and then you won't you just won't see them the rest of the time because you're

172
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
doing other managerial stuff and my

173
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm not a manager, but my management style when I choose to be a manager is

174
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,280
The even more frequent shorter kind of check-ins. Yes, you have to have longer discussions around

175
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Career and kind of what's going on when you need to dig deep

176
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
But i'm really big into the one-minute manager give get out of people's way

177
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
But dive in and find out what's going on and see if you need to intervene there was um

178
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,780
There was another on that same thread. There was another reach out

179
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,030
uh, or another

180
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:14,350
Another person I forget the name at the at this moment in time reached out and sent a thread

181
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,470
around sort of the role of a manager

182
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,590
and a belief that

183
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,550
A manager who holds on to the idea that they remain technical

184
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,120
was bad

185
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,440
particularly in the in the feedback context

186
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,600
And and I think the way to really address this feedback

187
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,680
problem

188
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,600
And I guess the third thing I would I would

189
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,080
Bring into play for those who have heard of it or not. Uh, there's there's this new sort of um

190
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
software engineering model

191
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,080
The way I'll wait till you're done. Sorry. Yeah that that

192
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,120
Zappos is really

193
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,120
What did they call it the holacracy? Yeah, it's holacr the holacracy

194
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,080
I was saying zappos is the primary example leverage throughout the but holacracy. There's no managers at all. So

195
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,280
Actually, and that was the thing when I first saw gears

196
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,420
twitter he's like

197
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,460
He was uncertain about this world where managers have one

198
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:22,140
Have weekly one-on-ones with him and I wasn't actually certain which direction he was talking from was he talking from the old school world where where

199
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,900
Basically managers get promoted because they're super technical and they suck at that actual job

200
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,540
Or more of the future world where there are no managers and he doesn't have sort of a command and control of or a head

201
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,540
He's expected to get feedback from when you look at we're gonna be all over the board on this because I have a whole bunch of ideas

202
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,780
on this yeah, that's the way, you know zappos is

203
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,460
Sort of famous for that holacracy culture and but

204
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,810
They don't have managers. This is I don't know which direction to go somebody signs paychecks

205
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,410
Somebody signs, you know off on purchase orders or whatever. So people do have authority to do those things

206
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,080
People don't report to each other

207
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,160
It can kind of work and I always thought I always

208
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,040
It's a great thought experiment to walk through. How would this work?

209
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,680
I'm going to talk through it when I think about any sort of complex concept

210
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
It helps me to think about extremes

211
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,560
Like what would it be like if there's no managers and whether I work at zappos not I can think about it

212
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,840
Well, somebody's got to step up and you're gonna have people

213
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,280
Now in a leadership role, I'm talking about

214
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,440
No, you already you brought up zappos. I'm going this direction. Okay

215
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,030
When you don't have any managers

216
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,060
People will still step up to lead you you're gonna get

217
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,380
Self-organizing teams. Yep, big believer and those are going to happen and

218
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,060
Want to force them to happen don't have any managers. Yep

219
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,260
They'll absolutely have to happen. You'll see that work out

220
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,980
And there are companies that have very few managers very flat and the same things happen

221
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,300
And there's not a lot of difference between a company with

222
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,380
Very flat company with very few managers, maybe 10 20 reports. I don't know that the employee counted zappos

223
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,660
Where you're going to see that because the org is big enough

224
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,480
that manager's job

225
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
As the org gets flatter ends up being a lot more just kind of

226
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,320
Keeping overhead under control and I wonder if in I love the thought experiment because I don't know any of this

227
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,240
I wonder if in an organization with no managers where you do have people that kind of end up

228
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,040
in that same sort of role, so my you know

229
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,480
for example

230
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,840
I may

231
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,080
Be on the self-organizing team where the strength that I give to the team is kind of keeping everybody organized and

232
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,640
making sure the work is moving forward and

233
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,840
That people have someone to come talk to when they have a question around anything from how to do something to career

234
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,320
In many worlds. I would be the manager of that team, but i'm really sort of the self-organized will say leader. Yeah

235
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,000
The whining it back to to feedback though

236
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,450
So you pick you are are organizing the process

237
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,910
That the challenge in that world that in terms of exploring your thought experiment

238
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,000
is

239
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,400
How do you improve?

240
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,460
How do you?

241
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
How do you get better at doing that role?

242
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,940
Let's say that's something you go you sit back and you reflect and you say man

243
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,250
I am good at this

244
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,130
But now you have the challenge of how do you get better?

245
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,610
You go. I want a special I want to become a specializing generalist and this is where i'm going to spend my

246
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,570
specialization time getting better at

247
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,900
How would you do you look for opportunities where you can do that?

248
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:45,130
You look for challenges look for challenges. Sure. Say I want to I want to add performance, you know testing performance analysis to my

249
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,450
To my specialties i've never done it before but it seems really interesting and a friend of mine does and he's pretty good at it

250
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,250
the so i'm going to look for

251
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:59,770
Opportunities, you know, let me let me shadow you. You know, somebody else is doing this. Let me shadow you on this

252
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,330
Nobody else is doing it. I'm going to take some time to go read about it and and cope with some ideas

253
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,610
I can try on my own and i'm going to try things i'm an experiment and then as I get a little farther

254
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,160
I realize wow

255
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,760
I can do these performance activities, but to really understand what they mean

256
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,120
I need to understand a little bit more about statistics and how to analyze this data effectively so we can make choices

257
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,280
So i'm going to dig in a little bit there and if you want to get better at something

258
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,920
um

259
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,880
You need to learn it right you need to learn and practice. Yes and deliberate practice

260
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,040
So you need to grow your ability towards those challenges. Yeah, and and

261
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
the only thing the only

262
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,670
Advantage having a manager

263
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,490
Gives you if we're still talking about that thing. Yep

264
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,370
In that situation is

265
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,400
If you don't know where to go

266
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,840
You can ask your manager where you can go, but there's a weird there can be a weird code dependency there

267
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,400
Because you can ask anybody that doesn't have to be your manager. You can ask anyone that you need

268
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,060
You need a suitable means to discover what you what you don't know and what you don't know you don't know

269
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,420
Correct and that you need to leverage your team for that more than

270
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,340
You know or at least as much as I don't know where a manager the person you work for provides any additional advantage there

271
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,340
Let me let me ask you

272
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,700
One additional question. Oh, yes. I love you. Is this the bonus round?

273
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,900
It is. All right. You did well in the first round. All right

274
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,030
How would you know?

275
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,510
That you're not just blowing sunshine up your ass

276
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,910
How would you know?

277
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,230
That you are actually doing good versus

278
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,770
You thinking you are

279
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,650
The work I do needs to provide value to the product

280
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,010
Okay, and how would you know if it's doing because what you just described is that you're now

281
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,250
Uh, the way I kind of envision what you described you are the world's best as far as you concern

282
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,290
Are we making?

283
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,650
product decisions that improve the customer experience

284
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,050
and

285
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,450
Depending on your definition of customer. Yep, but are we making product decisions that improve the customer experience?

286
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,530
Based on the work that i'm providing to the team. Let me um, let me let me be more precise

287
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:22,330
Because like I believe you can do that and be good at organizing the process and still be pissing off everyone that you're working with

288
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,960
Yes

289
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,600
And that feedback I get where you're going. Probably important

290
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,960
Yeah, so how do you find out? Okay, so I I can figure out the work i'm doing is helping the product

291
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,760
But you're asking me. How do I figure out if I am doing it in a way that is?

292
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,540
uh

293
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,220
I was gonna say socially acceptable, but how am I a good team member as well?

294
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,540
And we've talked about the things I value, you know on a team I work on i'm pretty straightforward, you know, does the work you do provide?

295
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,460
Value to the product. Uh, do you have what's your output?

296
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,180
Yeah, are you getting a reasonable amount of that work done and do you play well with others?

297
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,660
Yeah, those are when I look at someone I want to think how well you're doing I look at

298
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,700
Those things yes, and so how do I know if i'm playing well with others?

299
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,820
I always do no. I this is this is tying it back to awesome. I just know

300
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:23,740
Um, you can well in absence of a peer feedback system, which we've talked about before which I which I love and and sort of an ad hoc

301
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,900
Uh, if you can get people to really use one and rate people it's great. But ask people ask

302
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,460
If you don't have

303
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
A way to figure that out

304
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,020
I would ask people i've done that before

305
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,300
Um, i've asked someone to ask someone else about me if you're afraid to get that feedback directly

306
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,300
uh, but I really would prefer a sort of either

307
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,480
a

308
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,440
Feedback system could be anonymous or not or maybe even both

309
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,480
Uh, do you have an answer for that? How do how do you find out if you're pissing people off the actually you're always pissing people off

310
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
So, how do you find out when you're not pissing people off?

311
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,840
Uh, i'm also uh turns out i'm not pissing people off. Whoa, I'm pissing people off. Yeah

312
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,520
Particularly the times during the day where i'm sleeping and everyone else is nope pissing off

313
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
No, or hardly anyone at that time. Um

314
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,650
no, so

315
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:22,970
You just did a great thought exercise and and I think you kind of concluded that in a holacracy world

316
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:29,130
In order to to really succeed and not only as a team and a project

317
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,010
But when we're talking about a feedback system, we're really talking about the role of the individual

318
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,290
Mm-hmm and and how to help grow them

319
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,130
um

320
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,130
You you you have to have

321
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,170
Some sort of peer feedback tool and it turns out

322
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,890
holacracy acknowledges that

323
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,250
and um

324
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,250
You have to reduce the friction

325
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,930
Uh to enabling people to give

326
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,850
their

327
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,850
uh feedback

328
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,500
um

329
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,060
uh in a in a way that's actionable and uh nearly immediate

330
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,900
The the other thing most I have not seen

331
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,060
any article

332
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,500
That discusses holacracy in sort of a waterfall context

333
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:21,690
Right, uh, mostly most oftentimes you'll see holacracy. I'm going to say most currently i've it's all that i've seen

334
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,490
Uh are doing some sort of agile process

335
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,210
And agile, uh, one of the great benefits is it really tugs out

336
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,330
Transparency everyone knows what everyone knows

337
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,130
The in a holacracy world you really have to have collaboration

338
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,090
collaborative teams

339
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:46,490
Really helps to instill trust and that really helps to light up the sort of peer feedback mechanism

340
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,370
Going back to the other extreme though. Um talking about managers

341
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,930
right

342
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,930
I am a technical

343
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,890
manager, um

344
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:06,650
I I have gone through several years. Uh, i'm actually surprised honestly surprised when

345
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,650
My manager feedback scores are below. Uh 90 percent and it hasn't happened in

346
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,200
decades

347
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,940
the

348
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,940
the main reason why

349
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,420
I think most managers when when they go into that role and they stay super technical

350
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,260
It's because they don't understand the problem that they're trying to solve

351
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
Their their job isn't primarily to get the project across the wire

352
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,890
They have to do that

353
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,530
But it's it's more medium term long-term thinking

354
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,500
and and

355
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:45,660
Um, you cannot just do that without paying consequences. You will see your people going

356
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,300
Um stymieing you'll see your people getting to a point where

357
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:56,620
They're not getting support from you and they've kind of run to the end of of their ability to create a method

358
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,940
To get additional feedback and they move on

359
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,940
and

360
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,340
You can't do that. I I think you can't do that as a manager period but you absolutely can't do that in the software world

361
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,060
Because the number one asset

362
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,260
Is the knowledge that's between their ears?

363
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,580
And if you let if you let that go and you don't invest further in that you are short

364
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,300
Shrifting project acceleration. Did you say shrifting? I did I said short shrifting. What is shrifting?

365
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,900
Uh, that sounds like something that happens in a jail

366
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,220
I wish that's shiv shrift. I'm sure that I don't know

367
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,740
Uh short changing then all right, i'm gonna go with shrifting to make captain synonym here happy

368
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:47,500
Although you if the knowledge that's in their their heads and and allen's in another podcast he he's he's done

369
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,300
multiple

370
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,620
Discussions around the the importance of recognizing that we're not in the software

371
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,220
Industry we're in the knowledge worker industry

372
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,210
That we just happen to be using software

373
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,810
So the knowledge is the the primary asset therefore you're you're best motivated

374
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,490
to

375
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,650
Motivate and challenge and grow the person with that knowledge

376
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,210
And if you failed to do so, uh, you you better have a plan

377
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,490
For dealing with that knowledge leaving your team

378
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,540
And far too often I find these hyper technical managers either

379
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,880
uh

380
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,560
They they approach this as they're the guys that are going to do that

381
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
Or not. Let me give you a particular one

382
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,160
Quick story and then I think I think i'll end this topic. No, no, I I have more once you finally shut up. Okay

383
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,300
um

384
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,480
a manager

385
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Years ago the best manager i've ever had

386
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,830
He shared with me his number one rule of of management

387
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,650
Okay

388
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,650
He's like if you do nothing

389
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,030
If you do nothing

390
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,630
You have to do this

391
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,070
and that is

392
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,150
Your task as a manager is to earn your team's loyalty

393
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,020
number one earn your team's loyalty

394
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,460
uh

395
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:19,420
You don't you can either be a technical manager or you can be a um, a people manager or you can be like me someplace in between

396
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,540
but whatever it is

397
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,300
And you can do this in any of those styles if you're a technical manager

398
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,660
Then that means you're helping them grow by look doing code reviews and in helping them think of other algorithms or or other

399
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,180
ways to solve the the problem via an architectural stance

400
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,220
But it means you can't just fire and forget

401
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,540
You can't say

402
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,620
Alan you will do this by tuesday

403
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,260
And then come tuesday go why haven't it been done? Although alan would get it done

404
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,000
um

405
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
Loyalty is everything

406
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,000
now

407
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,600
and i'll i'll just

408
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,960
years ago

409
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Michael hunter blogged on this

410
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,000
For those who I think it's actually his last blog still

411
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,560
Um, he asked me to write up about the best bug i've ever encountered

412
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,720
And the best bug I ever encountered is when I completely screwed the pooch as a test manager

413
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,900
We had this product

414
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,370
We had these test plans of all the operating systems that we were going to work on

415
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I had a team of 40 people

416
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,640
Uh, the dev team had a team of 20 people

417
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Remember the days when test outnumbered dev?

418
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,880
And that was so stupid and we had like five pm's and we still couldn't test quality in no

419
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,440
um

420
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
So we had a team of like 60 people

421
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,480
And long story short our product relied on dcom

422
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,500
and

423
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
We were going to ship with office

424
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,280
And they were on windows 95 or 98 that did not have dcom

425
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,960
And we didn't discover until after office greenlighted

426
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,310
That we didn't work

427
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,310
on on that os

428
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,520
And we never did

429
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,240
So we had gone through a series of interrupts and changing plans and in that whole process. We had forgotten to test on that os

430
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,400
Okay

431
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,640
As the the test manager involved and the one responsible for quality

432
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
If I had been my manager that day, that would have been my last day of this company

433
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,470
Think thankfully I wasn't and I was on my way

434
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,830
Um to go have a conversation with my manager because he needed to know

435
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,910
one of my

436
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,630
uh

437
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,510
Managers that reported to me knew what I was about to do

438
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,950
And he interrupted me and he said brit

439
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,960
Do not do what you're going to do. He's like, I I don't know what what are you talking about?

440
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,640
I was trying to own the message what what i'm not doing anything

441
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,890
He knew better

442
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,890
He said before you do anything

443
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:03,210
Go home sleep on it and if if what you are what I think you're about to do if you still want to do it

444
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,730
I won't get in your way

445
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,730
I said, okay deal

446
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,730
I came back the next morning

447
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,290
That guy came and talked to me

448
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,970
um

449
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,970
But he was still wearing the same clothes

450
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,560
He and my entire team

451
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,640
had done an all-nighter

452
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:29,440
Working with dev they found they fixed the problem. They did an entire month's test pass

453
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,520
in one night

454
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,770
And it was entirely

455
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,090
Because they didn't want me

456
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,360
to um fall on my sword which was

457
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,380
Absolutely what I was about to go do

458
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
um, oh yes

459
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,990
now

460
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,750
The thing I would say

461
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,470
When it comes to to giving feedback the most important thing is everybody needs to know

462
00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:01,310
What actions to take next and it and it doesn't matter if it's um, if it's a poor performing employee

463
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,630
Or it's one of your stars

464
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,630
everyone wants to have

465
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,030
Ideas and thoughts of what's the next thing I can do to improve myself

466
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,350
and a lot of the times

467
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,910
Managers, even if you have a manager doing weekly 101 so that doesn't mean it's going to be good

468
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,150
A lot of those managers all they do is adjectives

469
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,240
Right. Uh, oh, you're great. You're excellent

470
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,680
Uh, or you suck or you need to improve or any of these type of things

471
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
And it's not concrete enough

472
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,210
um

473
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,410
that's

474
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,850
My secret to success as a manager is you got to give them

475
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,280
um

476
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:47,400
An action you got to give them action ability you have to earn their trust so that you can actually tell them the truth

477
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,950
And they'll hear it

478
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,450
Anyway

479
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,410
You have more to say I I got so lost in there

480
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,650
So what is I think I figured out I had a question on what a technical manager was and it's

481
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,610
But I think you answered that part way through so that's good

482
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,170
Um, I think most managers

483
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,250
Yeah, we're kind of mixed

484
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,050
At least on the test side with whether managers are technical or not

485
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,810
But most I think most managers these days have are technical to some level

486
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,850
I wanted to jump on another extreme because what we're talking it reminded me of

487
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,210
Sort of the well, let me ask you this see if it gets where i'm going if not we'll see we'll all adjust

488
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,410
Okay

489
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:29,530
So we talked about holacracy and uh self-organizing teams. What's the opposite of that?

490
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:36,330
What's the other end of the spectrum describe the structure and just briefly of what would be the other end of an extreme on that?

491
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,120
uh, the the one that

492
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,760
The one i'm thinking of is is kind of when I was introduced to to management

493
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:50,490
I was told this rule of thumb for each employee you have you should be spending 10 of your time

494
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:56,570
uh working with that employee to improve them or to to

495
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,610
Talk with them is good. Even back 10 of your time is invested in them, you know

496
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,690
Yeah, looking at in some hand wavy thing is is basically that's communicated

497
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,530
Which basically means if you had back in those days if you had a team of 10

498
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,810
That's all you should be doing

499
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,930
Um, so I think that's that's the opposite extreme

500
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,740
Someplace where you have due to some team size and your accountability

501
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:29,820
That's all you do. Yeah, I wonder if so my take on that is if that's your and somebody may have that

502
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,900
that

503
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,740
Idea still in their head, but I wonder if your team really grows

504
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,500
It's kind of like you gotta set them free and my whole my one of my principles around

505
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,900
management is

506
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:49,100
Give people a framework they can work in and then get out of their way and then I combine that with uh,

507
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,140
Sort of the one-minute manager concept. It's it's a nice little business parable book easy to read

508
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,300
I suggest you fly through it, but you just need to know when

509
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,460
to dive in and and when to intervene and and you do that by

510
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,580
Knowing what's going on in your team doesn't need to be uh,

511
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,820
You know a constant monitoring and sometimes people more monitoring than others, but it's it's not hovering either

512
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,100
It's getting out of their way until you need to be

513
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,860
Need to know what's going on I completely agree the

514
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,180
One of the speeches that I give often to my teams

515
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Is in order to learn and grow?

516
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
You have to take on challenges

517
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,180
And you have to make mistakes. Absolutely

518
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:37,820
Um a lot of managers I've talked to when I when I say no, you need to let your team make mistakes

519
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:43,660
They look at me like oh my god, they're too afraid. My project's gonna fail blah blah blah too afraid

520
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,060
And you don't and but they don't understand that

521
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,820
The reason why you need to make let them make mistakes is so that you can help them learn from it

522
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,900
Yeah, I just wonder if you are the overbearing, you know 10 percent of your time

523
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,980
Dedicated to each employee if they have that room to grow and you sort of develop this

524
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,620
Dependency or codependency where as an employee i'm not sure what to do unless my manager comes by and gives me that

525
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,260
You know invest that hour a day and I didn't do the math. They're not that much but you know, um

526
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,980
Diving in and telling me, you know what I need to be doing. I need to figure things out on my own

527
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,060
One of the things with my current job Microsoft is I mentioned this a lot and someone asked yesterday

528
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,940
How do you figure out what to do?

529
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,100
I said there's always work to do and i've had a good track record of being able to figure out

530
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,020
What's the most important work to do? But I haven't had a manager tell me what to do in

531
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:39,550
Since I can remember it's been since like late 90s since I had a manager actually gave me assignments

532
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
That's I think that's

533
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,660
Positive I think so too. That's not a bad thing

534
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:52,780
I'm not saying negative things about my managers with with they trust me to figure out what needs to get done with one possible thing

535
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,180
Is like you only know what you what you are capable of knowing and I do think

536
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,220
Um, the only weakness to that is it would have been good

537
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,500
uh

538
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,140
At least annually a manager assigned you something

539
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,460
That's somewhat out of your

540
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,420
Comfort zone and not your wheelhouse or something that you would normally choose to do because that helps you grow

541
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,540
I know but as going back to my comment on

542
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,460
uh, michael arson's blog and and and my uh

543
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,800
Relation to that is that I do pick things that are hard. I do pick things out of my comfort zone

544
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Alan is an active learner. So so yeah, I don't say yeah, I this is not a

545
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,560
A a path that's maybe automatic for everyone. Yeah

546
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
The the other thing uh, the last thing I think i'll say on this topic

547
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,120
I thought you were done already I was and then and then you said something that I liked

548
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,240
I don't know if you have figured out how this podcast thing works. We like talk and bounce the ideas off each other. Anyway

549
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
We'll work that out

550
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,720
Maybe maybe that can be an action for you to take. Hey brant. Take take this action

551
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,000
Alan yet again indicated that brint is number one

552
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,020
One thing I think these technical managers because you you you did say an insight

553
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,090
Around that they're afraid they're afraid to do this

554
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:20,690
And one of the things I think these these super technical managers need to get over or or hopefully it'll give them some some help

555
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,170
And hope to experiment

556
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,410
But the reason why you want to let you

557
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,610
uh

558
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,020
People make those mistakes

559
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,380
Actually, why do you think why would it be valuable to that technical manager to let those people make mistakes?

560
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,540
Valuable to him valuable to him. I don't know tell me

561
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
it's it's primarily because

562
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,290
Learning is what causes an acceleration

563
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:50,770
If you don't let them make those mistakes and you don't give them the the the ability to actionably grow

564
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,450
Then you're going to be dealing with a static world from exactly. Yeah, right

565
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,450
You don't have the ability to accelerate this forward progress. You don't have the ability to scale

566
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,690
And quite honestly for those managers growing your team and getting them to to do that ability to scale

567
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:17,010
Is important to your career growth. Yeah, I i'm a also a big believer in the learning organization and yeah singe's work there

568
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,710
Absolutely with the 100 and not enough that happens

569
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,790
uh, the last thing that reminded me of as we continue to babble around this is

570
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,390
uh

571
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,390
In holo in a holocracy

572
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,470
Where does the decision making happen?

573
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,550
It rotates it happens at where it needs to at the closest point to where it needs to happen

574
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,630
and I believe in that for a team too, I

575
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,470
Uh, I think a lot of managers have you shared your world of warcraft story on podcasts yet. I'm sure I have

576
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:52,860
So yeah in brief I believe a lot in the world of warcraft theory of project management where?

577
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,240
You form a group

578
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
You know to accomplish a specific task

579
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,520
You work on that task together share the rewards then you either disband or take on another task

580
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,040
Yeah, and and who's the leader in the the world of warcraft model it rotates right? It depends

581
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,280
I think that model is all about holocracy and you know, i've done this dungeon before i'll be the leader

582
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,040
great

583
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
I've rode this pony before. Um

584
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:26,610
So, where was I going? Oh so decision making in hawks and in a self-organizing team in general it happens where it needs to

585
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,970
Many managers I know and i'm going to tell a quick story here

586
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,850
Uh want to be the single point for that decisions for their team

587
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,020
Slows the team down a lot

588
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Now think about what happens and as microsoft people going oh god

589
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,900
I have stories for you and I will tell you the same story you're probably thinking in your head. I worked on a product once

590
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,280
where

591
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,700
our vice president

592
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,220
Not my favorite vice president at microsoft, but you can't don't know what i'm talking about because they have like 150 of them

593
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,660
But you know, I I think I mentioned this to you right at apple

594
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,020
They have like a cto a cfo a couple vps and that's it

595
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,460
I'm trying to guess the vp and we have 150. So anyway, is this a vp? So anyway here? Yes

596
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
Okay, not the one I was thinking of

597
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,740
Anyway, I better not say the name because um, yeah, it'll be obvious to some

598
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,580
And if I say his name i'll just start going off on him and this will be my final podcast recorded on the microsoft campus

599
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,420
but anyway, but anyway, but anyway, he was

600
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:33,580
He wanted to be involved in every decision and talk about a technical manager. Here's where you can go too far to the extreme is

601
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:42,940
We would be in he would show up to uh, like a ship room meeting we're going over bugs and he would dive in and want to discuss

602
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,740
Everything down to which reg key we are going to modify to do

603
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
You to make this work

604
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,860
At some point as a manager you can be you can be I mean even if you i'm a technical manager of a team of eight people

605
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,390
uh, I

606
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,190
There's a point, you know, i'm I can see myself fairly technical beyond the line. That's like way

607
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,430
I know on the line like

608
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,870
You need to trust people to make decisions and get out of their way and at some point

609
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:15,810
There are bigger problems you need to worry about than minutia implement minutia of implementation

610
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,550
When I see managers at that level like the first thing

611
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,950
um

612
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,380
I go

613
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,340
This guy seems like he's being defensive like yeah

614
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,940
And and typically people who aren't being defensive

615
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,940
In this case, he wasn't defensive. I really think that he

616
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,700
In a way, he sort of validated himself. It's like yeah, I can i'm a vp

617
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,780
But I still dive in here and you know if I had to I would write this code

618
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,590
I will tell you a a

619
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:52,750
Different story the best vp I ever worked for and i'll even mention his name. It was bob muglia

620
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,070
He was highly technical

621
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:03,550
I I remember, uh very fondly a day he and I spent three hours

622
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,290
uh

623
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,290
Bullshitting, uh outside

624
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,910
Talking about uh his exchange server deployment that he did all by himself

625
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,150
At his home now why a vp needs his own exchange server deployment at home

626
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,390
Doesn't matter

627
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,870
He did he had his own domain and pop wasn't enough, but he um

628
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
He at that time was vp

629
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,560
uh of server and tools division

630
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,060
right, so

631
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,060
That was his

632
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,820
I would I would say what he was doing and the reason when he went through those actions

633
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,580
He was highly tech the most technical vp i've ever worked for

634
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,300
But in terms of the space that he owned

635
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:53,420
I would argue what he was doing and why he was doing it was more so around customer empathy and helping his business grow

636
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,780
Not I mean he never got in our business. That is

637
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,420
Completely different. Yeah, I mean that's passion for technology which is completely different from

638
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:11,230
Diving in way too deep on day to day implementation details. That's a great example of get the you know, get out of their way

639
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,170
I'm just i'm just imagining your your last vp going through like a code review and going hey

640
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,970
Hard-coded string that shouldn't be there

641
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,810
My last vp. No, he definitely wouldn't have done that

642
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,090
He was the one you were talking about. I don't know that's the last one. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's the last one the last one's actually

643
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,490
Um, I you know, I like him

644
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
He's not my vp anymore. I have a different vp

645
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,540
I can't keep track how many different vps have I worked for? Oh my god

646
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,380
I don't even want to count. Yeah. All right, even certain which you're talking about

647
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,140
I I don't think we have time to dive into our last topic. So I have to shelve it

648
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,020
We will and I think actually
