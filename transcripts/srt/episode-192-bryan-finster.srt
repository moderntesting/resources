1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
to have the same mindset that you need to be a tester because a software engineer

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,560
has to have that same what could go wrong. I've carried a pager for 20 years. I guarantee you,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,320
I can think like a tester. There's nothing that gives you a quality mindset like not having to

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,850
wake up at three o'clock in the morning. Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:31,490
podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:37,170
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now, on with the show. Hey everybody,

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,410
welcome back to the AVE Testing Podcast. Happy new year. I am here. I'm Alan. We have Brent.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:43,810
Hello.

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,530
This is I.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:44,770
Hello.

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,730
We also have Brian Finster. Brian, say hi.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,170
Hi, I'm Brian.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,290
I am excited to have you here for a bunch of reasons that will emerge. What I want to do

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,730
first is give a little context on why Brian's here. This is both for our listeners who may not

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,050
have seen. We talk about you on our Slack. If you want to go to join our Slack group,

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,690
you can go to moderntesting.org, click on the link, join right away. We've talked a little

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,090
bit about some of your LinkedIn posts. Good stuff. We're not talking dirty behind your back or

18
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,810
anything. But I imagine Brian being much more of an internet celebrity than Brent and our three

19
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,250
listeners. There's people coming to listen to our podcast going, why is Brian hanging out with these

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,570
two half-baked people trying to make a podcast for eight years?

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,610
Dude, I'm seriously half-baked. I don't understand.

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,010
Yeah, okay. Between all of us, we are one and a half-baked.

23
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,850
And this is also a context for you, Brian, to know why did these guys invite me here?

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:51,170
So once upon a time, about eight years ago, Brent and I were both in testing roles at Microsoft.

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:57,410
I led a few cross-company test-related groups, and Brent and I had such a good rapport in there.

26
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,050
And we've been giving each other crap like this now going on 10 years that someone,

27
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,770
I think it was Michael Hunter said, you can start a podcast. What was that, Brent?

28
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:13,970
It's been longer than 10 years. I met you when I joined the TLT, right? So it's been longer than

29
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,450
that. That was the test leadership team at Microsoft. And I'm going to assume it's the

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,130
same for all of you. I have now lost my ability to track how many years have gone by.

31
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,090
There was a blurry few years in there that are still blurry. But anyway, we started a podcast.

32
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,290
And we're going to figure this out as we go. And we talked about doing a podcast. But

33
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:39,570
one thing happened very early on as we very early on, the conversation shifted to something

34
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,970
prominent. And it was that Brent and I were both seeing that software delivery was changing.

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,450
It was changing definitely before then, but Microsoft is usually the last to know about

36
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,050
changes and how software is made. Dude, I came from Walmart, so.

37
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,570
There is the clip that goes on the beginning. Dude, I came from Walmart.

38
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,090
So we saw this world where fast feedback loops wouldn't need armies of testers because they would

39
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,850
get in the way. And we could reach higher quality by focusing on feedback loops, data,

40
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,090
and adaptability. So we talked about that because we were seeing it. We weren't trying to invent

41
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,250
anything. We were talking about what we were seeing. So we talked about that on the podcast

42
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,330
with the goal of helping testers navigate these changes that were going on because things are

43
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,290
changing. Things are still changing in some ways. Things are still the same. They're a

44
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,610
little bit different. Fast forward a bit. We came up with these modern testing principles,

45
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,130
which were the idea was to try and like, what are the principles behind what we've been

46
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,410
talking about for a few years now? And they're not modern and they're not about testing,

47
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:55,650
but we wrote them as sort of the, not the antidote, but the growth, like the traditional

48
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,130
test as a gatekeeper type of testing to modern testing where things are different.

49
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,170
They're really modern delivery, but we're keeping them. We still call them the modern testing

50
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:13,170
principles. We, if I may interject, we call them that mostly because to resonate with the audience,

51
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,810
we were trying to target. We saw two movements. It's super important. I mean, you have to do that.

52
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,330
In Alan's story, all of that is true. One of the things though,

53
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,570
that at least I experienced. So I spent a good amount of my career in middle management in QA.

54
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,890
And Alan very similarly, while he was at Microsoft, he avoided management, but

55
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:47,570
he still had very high scoped roles with large reach, large impact. And so when we both started

56
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,890
talking while he was still at Microsoft, and this was before Microsoft did his big switch,

57
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,610
when to sort of dramatically reduce the number of testers, we both had at that point in time

58
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:11,410
experienced around, Oh, this is what happens. This is why this works. Because back then Agile was,

59
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,820
was like crazy sauce, right? They're like, what do things without a hundred page document?

60
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,860
That's crazy. Alan and I were not only, not only did we see that it was coming,

61
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,440
but at that point in time, we were one of the few that wholeheartedly defended that that is the way

62
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,400
we should be going. Which I don't know about Alan, he's far more charismatic than I am, but it

63
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:51,680
did cause some sacrifice to some friendships on that front. What? You're deserting. How can you?

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:02,000
The creator. Exactly. And based on, based on LinkedIn comments, I'm guessing Brian, that that is a

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,800
phenomenon you're familiar with. I did give Brent some pre reading to kind of get familiar with it.

66
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
So this is interesting because I really want to talk to about the history about how I came

67
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,760
came to this. Yeah. Because I've been a software developer doing product development since 1996.

68
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,310
I've been doing it for awhile. Honestly, did it the way that I know a lot of people still do it,

69
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,710
which is I code something and then I go and manually test it and I go deploy it and hope

70
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,980
it doesn't blow up for years and years and years. You know, if you, and this before I,

71
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,900
before I worked at Walmart, but you know, Walmart, we went through a whole bunch of Agile

72
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,180
transformations as one does, which right after they sent us to PMI training, by the way,

73
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,220
which was really interesting. You know, I, I was one test away from being a project manager,

74
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,540
like fully certified by PMI. But we got to the point where we'd stabilized. I worked in

75
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,780
logistics at the time and I was working in warehouse management systems. And, you know,

76
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,270
the primary system I worked on was, I mean, oh my God, it made windows look small. I'm pretty sure.

77
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:14,590
I mean, it's, it's just a nightmare of old, it was like four different warehouse management

78
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:21,150
systems all banged together with a common database that we'd applied after this modernization effort.

79
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,900
But we were delivering that thing almost four times a year. Now this is also a period of time

80
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,540
when Walmart was going through a lot of acquisitions. So we're getting a lot of other markets,

81
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,380
you know, South Africa and Central America and all these, all these different markets.

82
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:46,480
And, you know, we need them to be on a common logistics system. We don't want to be integrating

83
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,640
all their legacy logistics systems. And, you know, we're delivering change every

84
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,820
three to four times a year. We did a value stream map one time and it was,

85
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,800
took us 12 months from a business request to deliver it to production. Right. I mean,

86
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,760
it was a nightmare. And every single time we did a deploy, so at the time, so I'm talking

87
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,720
about when we're just at the cusp of doing things correctly, they put me in charge of the team

88
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,160
responsible for integrating all of the feature branches every quarter for the quarterly release.

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Right. I talked to, it sounds like a fun job. It was a fun job. Now they, it was very entertaining.

90
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,040
They, they gave me this job because I've been really looking into how other organizations

91
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,080
were doing source management. And I thought we could do it better. And they gave me the

92
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,150
mandate of making the team obsolete, making the team go away. Right. So it was an improvement

93
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,510
effort. And I was like, I'm all over that. I don't want to sit here. Let's make things better.

94
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,710
And I talked to Gene Kim about this after when he, he said we had drafted unicorn project and

95
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,270
he was talking about merge day for the Phoenix project. It was like 350 branches. I was like,

96
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:03,570
that's nothing. Hold my beer. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

97
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:15,380
Brian, are you the real Brent? No, no, I'm not. But I am the sad that had to integrate 400 branches

98
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:22,340
every quarter, you know? And so you integrate 400 plus branches every quarter. And, you know,

99
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,780
then you deal with the merge conflicts and then you're six weeks late and then you go and deploy

100
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,820
and you've got scheduled war rooms for like scheduled here's the schedule for the next

101
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,940
week. Who's going to be working which part of the 24 hours seven day a week shift to support and

102
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,780
stabilize the system after this delivery for just the initial part of the stabilization. Okay.

103
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,240
So I mean, I did it's just a nightmare. And it was just normal, right? I mean,

104
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,160
it's not a nightmare because that's just how you work. And then SVP said, Hey, look,

105
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,910
we need to do this every two weeks because we can't meet our business goals by delivering

106
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,370
this slowly. And so what do they do? Of course, what they did was they hired McKinsey and Bain

107
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,650
and brought in no, no, no, no, no, actually, Randy, Randy, the SVP at the time, Randy Salley,

108
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,010
love that guy still have beer with him. Randy presented this as an engineering problem to us

109
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:25,260
senior engineers in logistics and said, Hey, I need you to fix this. Right? So one of my

110
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,410
teammates got a copy of continuous delivery. We read it. We knew about Conway's law.

111
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:40,980
We I read like the domain driven design for dummies. And we put together a plan for leadership

112
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:49,090
about how we can go to more frequent delivery. And in fact, when Patrick and I were working through

113
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:55,120
this, we had a, there was project manager assigned to this project. And Patrick and I said, okay,

114
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,440
look, we think there were two weeks isn't aggressive enough. We need to go for daily.

115
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
If we go for daily, we might go for weekly. If we go for over two weeks, we might be hit every month.

116
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,600
So let's go for daily. And the project manager said, well, they asked for over two weeks. We

117
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
don't care. We're going for daily. So will I quit? If you guys are going to do that,

118
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,680
like we don't need you because we're doing this for two decades. We're fine on our own things.

119
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:24,220
And we drove for daily, but just so, but imagine the situation we're in. We are a bunch

120
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,700
of developers who we have a QA area. Who's been doing all the testing for us, mostly manual.

121
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,540
None of the developers in the area actually know how to test at all. Okay. We're not going to go

122
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,820
for daily production delivery. So today's code goes to production today. That was our goal.

123
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,040
Now we had an ops area too, because they'd gone through the whole matrix organization fat and

124
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,440
split off support from product from development where we used to run what we brung. They pulled

125
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:04,290
that away for developer productivity, which just destroyed quality even further. But they, the ops

126
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,090
SLA was that you had to be stable for 90 days before they'd take it over, but we're delivering

127
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,210
every single day. So we'll never get it to them. So that means we're going to get ops back,

128
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,790
which made me incredibly happy. Honestly, I wanted ops back, but that also means we're going to be

129
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,810
delivering untested code every single day to production. None of the work. So we have to

130
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:32,450
dig into testing. And so I started taking testing very, very seriously. And I started working

131
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,050
through this problem, just going backwards from I need to deploy every single day.

132
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,940
It has to be validated that it's ready for production every single day. The way all this

133
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,540
testing is being done right now will not work. So we have to reinvent all of testing.

134
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,840
I had to get the QA lead that was assigned to us on board. We had to, as the pilot teams,

135
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,300
learn how to test from scratch. I've got a copy of XUnit test patterns. It was like 900 pages

136
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,540
long. I was pouring through that. I was pouring through everything I can find. I was interviewing

137
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,900
developers about why they were struggling with testing. It was like, Oh, well, because the

138
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:16,140
requirements are crap. So I discovered, I found the behavior driven development. We learned to do

139
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,400
that. So we could get clean requirements so that we would know what to test. And we were doing

140
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,280
all this upfront work so that we can write testing code, do real continuous integration,

141
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:36,110
and push testing code to production. And so what my takeaway from this journey was the continuous

142
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:44,180
delivery is a quality initiative that it stress-tested your quality process and that you must

143
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:53,150
focus on quality if you're going to be good at this. Later on, I went to the lady who used to be

144
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:59,150
my senior director. She moved to be the senior director of QE because I rebranded QA to QE and

145
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,910
told her she needed to hire me to drive CD across the organization because CD was a quality

146
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:14,000
initiative, not a development initiative. And every since then, test architecture,

147
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:23,970
how do I get from idea to production with fewer handoffs, fewer, less reworked,

148
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:31,250
faster feedback at every single step. There was a, early on in this process, QA put on this

149
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:38,160
whole quality conference. And I was one of the keynote speakers, not in QA, talking about how

150
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,240
testing, you test everything. You test meetings. You don't go to a meeting list. You have an agenda

151
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,590
that you can assert against. That's an interesting angle.

152
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,750
It's like if you don't have an agenda for a meeting, don't show up because you have nothing

153
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,430
to assert against to find out if you got value from the meeting. I said we're testing for value,

154
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:00,990
not for adherence to spec. Yes. So much yes.

155
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:09,630
And people say, well, how do you test the test? You ship it. The test is just prod.

156
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,110
You don't. That's how you test the test. You don't. I love that phrase. I'm writing it down.

157
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:23,730
You test for value. I wrote a blog post recently called the three wrongs. And this is something

158
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,770
I, you know, just like an epiphany I had several years ago that the whole, the reason for all this

159
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:36,770
agile nonsense is everything is wrong all the time. The problem with classic testing process where you

160
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,970
have product owner or BA or somebody creating requirements, handing them to the development

161
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,970
team and then handing them to a testing team to automate the tests or do manual testing

162
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,530
is that it's missing the foundational principle that the requirements probably wrong in the

163
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,330
first place. And on top of that, we're going to misunderstand them because of the handoff.

164
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,690
And then when you hand them to a development team and a testing team, you double the chance

165
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,690
misunderstanding. And I've measured this in real life on development teams with value stream maps

166
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,350
and interviews when we were, when I was running the dojo. I've seen this in reality where the

167
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:16,000
testing team misunderstood the requirements differently from the product team. And they

168
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,800
both misunderstood the requirements for what the product owner meant. And the product owner

169
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,820
actually misunderstood the need. And I have documented that in value stream maps.

170
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:32,380
I think it's Crosby. I think it's Crosby. Now I'm taking this myself who said,

171
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,810
quality is conformance to requirements. And I've modified that before you cringe and go,

172
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:45,170
I believe it. It's true. Quality is conformance to requirements, but only the customer can define

173
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:53,490
requirements. I gave it there was a talk. Oh, even further, the customers, customer themselves

174
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,290
may not actually know the requirements. No, they don't until they see it and then they can edit it.

175
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:05,810
Yeah. Right. Right. But the, there's a talk I used to give. So the last role I held at Walmart

176
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:11,330
was I led the DevOps Studio at Walmart. And our job was to, we were using continuous delivery

177
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:18,050
as a forcing function or to improve engineering excellence and business delivery across the

178
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,520
organization. We were building a platform that was optimized for that. If you weren't using a CD

179
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,480
workflow, the platform was hard. It fought you on purpose. Like we need Gitflow. Yeah. No,

180
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:38,340
we're Gitflows on our roadmap. And I was asked to create a dojo where you use immersive learning

181
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,980
to help teams learn continuous delivery. We're like hands on, we join your team as engineers,

182
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,220
not freaking agile coaches, and pair with you while you learn CD in your context with your work.

183
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:57,330
And I used to give these talks about testing and one of the talks I gave about testing,

184
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:05,250
I always started off with this definition of quality. And I had an image of the 2017 MacBook

185
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:11,570
Pro. Now do you guys remember the 2017 MacBook Pro? Oh, that's the one with the touch bar. They

186
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:18,700
added the touch bar. They removed the escape key. They removed MagSafe charging. They removed all

187
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,180
the ports and just use USB C. It was the highest quality piece of crap you could buy. And I had

188
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,420
a picture of this and I was talking about how I'm a photographer. They took away my SD card

189
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,900
reader. So now I have to go down over SD card reader. I have dogs, large dogs. So they run past

190
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,580
the coffee table, trip on the cord, right? When they ripped the computer off the coffee table

191
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,820
instead of just some MagSafe cable detaching. I'm a software developer who focuses on Unix.

192
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:56,050
I need my escape key. How am I going to get out of VI? And I'm like, when that computer came out,

193
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,730
I bought a refurbished of my personal machine. I needed a new one. I bought a refurbished 2016

194
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,610
instead of a new 2017 because it was garbage. And then I was starting to say, this is what

195
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,210
quality means. Quality means it meets the user's need. Not that it meets the spec.

196
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:22,270
I have a whole other thing about why I don't do that. But this is the core fundamental thing

197
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:29,420
is that everything we do is wrong until we can get it to the front of the end user

198
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:37,260
and find out what's wrong so that we can adjust. And that the reason I focus so hard on continuous

199
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:44,140
delivery is because of the joy that we felt when we were able to deliver multiple times a day

200
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,820
to the end user, get feedback directly from that end user, adjust, give them feedback the next day,

201
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:58,780
they were happy. We were happy. Morale was high. Quality was high. Everybody should work that way,

202
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,100
but it requires rethinking all the things that you think you know are true.

203
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,970
Yeah. A million percent. Yes. Every once in a while I joined a new team and somebody doesn't

204
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,410
get it. And I remember at my last company, I joined the new team or talking about delivery.

205
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:24,290
I said I would rather ship 10 times a day than once a week. And the SVP just, I don't get why

206
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:31,170
you would say that. It's fine. It's fine. We're not going to go into it. But I convinced him.

207
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,610
It took me a few years, but he was on board. It's just a different way of thinking.

208
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,010
Well, you get terrified of size, right? Once you do it, you get terrified. It's like,

209
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,570
what do you mean 500 lines of code? Are you kidding me?

210
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,330
No. Well, so part of it is like in the transformation. And I think you're right.

211
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:59,230
Right. In my own journey on shifting to agile, like for me,

212
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,590
I've told this multiple times on the podcast, but I'll do it. I'll do the short version for Brian.

213
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,430
Everyone else can press the skip 30 seconds.

214
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:20,030
I went to Scrum. We executed it poorly. A two week Scrum ended up taking three months for us to

215
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:29,390
unscrew up. And then we shifted to a Kanban model where basically a small little thing ships

216
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:37,390
independently. And in order to execute that, you had to make certain changes. You had to make smaller

217
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:44,880
changes. You had to cover the entire test suite, as you called out just a second ago.

218
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:53,040
But where the magic went in is one day, one of my people submitted something and everything was on

219
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,660
the floor. Now that sounds like a bad story. However, because it was just one change that went

220
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:06,340
in that put everything on the floor, it took seconds for us to back it out, took seconds for

221
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:16,660
us to repair it. The guy knew instantly what he did wrong and get it out. I had to multiple times

222
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,140
go forward and try to do the same conversations you did. And that Alan just talked about

223
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:28,820
convincing others to take the risk on my team, we're going to execute this way. And to your

224
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:34,500
point, this is the point I resonate with. When they think, oh, we're going to ship once a week,

225
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,780
they have the size in their head. And then when we say we're going to do it 10 times a day,

226
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,780
they don't automatically shift that size in their head. How are you going to do that 10 times a day?

227
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,620
Well, it's actually we're not we're shifting to small batch.

228
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,620
Yeah, it takes a lot of practice. And I've been having the last couple of days, I've been having

229
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,660
some really intense discussions with people who are trying to redefine continuous integration,

230
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:09,870
so they can feel better about not doing it. And but here's the thing, okay, is that that

231
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:14,670
driving down that batch size is not the goal, it's the forcing function to the goal.

232
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:24,510
Yes. Okay. And I'll give you another example that you reminded me of is that of something saving

233
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:33,230
our ass, because we took CD seriously. Okay, I had the when we've been going on for a while,

234
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,790
and one of the other teams have been focusing on working this way. And I had a direct dependency on

235
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:42,430
them. They were the they were my downstream service that I needed a lot of information from.

236
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,550
I worked very closely with the tech lead. We were doing contract driven development.

237
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,400
Anytime we needed a contract, anytime we needed to change between the two of us,

238
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,600
we were coordinating through our contracts, we can deploy independently, because that was the

239
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,360
other thing we put rules in place when we started this, every team delivers in any sequence,

240
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,160
asynchronously from anybody else, which meant we had to focus on really good API management.

241
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,630
Well, there was a test that we had to run, where we would, and this is logistics, we get a

242
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:22,030
purchase order come in, it would process through their system. And then we would do something

243
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:28,350
to validate that we were actually could receive freight, and create inventory. And that was the

244
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:38,960
test took four hours to run that test. I can't do CD that way. And so it's Walmart. We didn't

245
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,720
have a lot of external information, all works very inwardly facing, we independently invented

246
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:55,070
virtual services. We submitted a pull request to my colleague's team, to give them a contract mock

247
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:02,370
of their API. And then created a process where we would send a test, a test header.

248
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,060
And they would get they would serve the mock instead of actually hitting their actual

249
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,080
logic. And so now this integration test between the two teams went from four hours to microseconds.

250
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:24,240
So the way but but Brian, you're testing the mock. Yep. We also get contract tests to test the mock

251
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,440
against the actual response so that we can validate the mock. Anytime you're doing a contract test.

252
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,540
So when you're doing integration tests with mocks, you also have to have a contract test to validate

253
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:42,620
the mock. Sure. Right. So we did both. Okay. But the result of that, though, is that they

254
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,500
made it when we were going live in the distribution center, and they had us in a distribution center

255
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,220
with really terrible network latency and all sorts of other problems. Because of course they did.

256
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:59,420
We're we're going live. And we're making changes rapidly as because there's always the things that

257
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,150
you didn't know about until you actually try to use the system for real. They broke their contract.

258
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,440
And we discovered it instantly when we ran our test the next time before anything deployed.

259
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:21,280
And before anything could have broken anything in production. Because they're just just that broke

260
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:30,000
the test immediately. Right. But the only reason that that test existed that way is because you

261
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,320
can't do CD with the way we were doing integration testing before. Right. Right. It's the driving

262
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:44,080
down to focusing on speed of feedback. Driving down that batch size forces you to solve these problems.

263
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,500
And it makes you safer. It removes drama. It makes the work suck less.

264
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:02,110
You know, this is something that I've started to do with my junior. So years ago,

265
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:12,190
I shifted away from QA, went to dev. And now, and then little after that, I became a data scientist.

266
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:18,030
And now I actually run a sort of a dev team that's producing data science driven services.

267
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:32,420
One of the things that that energizes your ICs is closing the loop between the customer value

268
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:41,540
proposition and their actual work. Oh, dude, dude. So I gave a talk with my teammate in

269
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:48,000
2017 at DevOps Enterprise Summit. Because I'd gone to the conference the first time in 2015.

270
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,640
And I saw all these executives talking about all these things we're doing and how it impacts the

271
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,560
enterprise. Like bullshit. How's an enterprise? We need to tell everybody how it impacts the teams.

272
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,020
And we had a slide that talked about how it made us love developing it.

273
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,550
We were beating animated heart on the slide. And it just made us love development again because of

274
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:15,890
that. Because we got to see our work being used instantly. We got feedback. I talked to somebody

275
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,680
at the conference that year who was a platform developer for Exxon. And he said, it seems like

276
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,860
all the best developers get a platform because it can be closer to the customer. And I just moved

277
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,100
to Walmart platform and the people I worked with, I was like, oh yeah, I agree.

278
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,700
That makes sense. People are motivated by progress.

279
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,980
And Dan, you've gotten there. But one thing, if I can, I'm going to change just,

280
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:52,580
not even a change of gear, a little bit of a veer here. Your journey on discovering testing,

281
00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:00,100
I think is pretty unique. But maybe not. I don't know. I see the pockets, everything we're talking

282
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,540
about, things we're seeing happen all over the place. But there's still a lot of people

283
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:10,740
doing the old way. When I spent a chunk of my career teaching developers how to test and having

284
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,460
very good luck with it and realizing that developers actually could be very good testers.

285
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,940
And I tried to accelerate that via, sometimes on one project, I did a lot of it just by doing a

286
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:28,930
whole lot of code reviews. And what I found is, one, developers can be very good testers.

287
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:36,110
And two, not surprisingly, when developers knew testing was part of what they were delivering,

288
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,670
they began to design better code in the first place because they started to think about testability

289
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:45,390
as they were creating the code. And they go, well, I'm going to test this. They would think

290
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:53,070
ahead. You discovered a lot of devs without, may not think of that contract testing solution.

291
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,190
Well, that's amazing how they didn't know this exists. So there's a curiosity. I'm curious,

292
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:05,950
one question is, how did you discover some of the nuance? And then the other end of that,

293
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,230
I know you've written on LinkedIn a little bit about this before. I want to talk about it a

294
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,470
little bit. But there's this whole developers can't test thing, which we know is bullshit.

295
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,470
And I'm just curious on why you think people think that as well. So first question,

296
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:25,390
how did you get so good at testing without a great coach like me? And two,

297
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:34,270
Brent, I'm muting himself just to laugh. And then two, what do you think it'll take to get

298
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,550
more people to figure out that devs can actually do really good testing?

299
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:48,780
So, you know, I found mentors. Liz Keo has no idea who I am. Okay, I have talked to her on

300
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:56,660
Twitter occasionally. If I ever meet her, she gets so much beer or whiskey or whatever her favorite

301
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:03,060
drink is, because she was my behavior driven development mentor. I consumed everything that

302
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,900
she had to say about that. I went out and found people. I'm spanking on the name, the guy who

303
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:18,300
wrote cucumber and cheese. I was finding these resources out there. I found the Xunip

304
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:26,220
webpage and I was pulling from that. It was my job to discover how we can do this. And then

305
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,300
to spread that knowledge, because we had to solve the problem of continuous delivery. Patrick,

306
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,580
my colleague, he was working on the automation. I was working on how to use the automation.

307
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:48,500
And so that was, I had to, it was my eval. And then also binding other people,

308
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,180
if you don't know how to test, we can't do CD. I needed everybody to do CD. Even before we,

309
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:03,500
this is why, even before we started using continuous delivery as an enterprise

310
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:10,780
improvement strategy, I knew that if we didn't spread the disease of continuous delivery to

311
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,500
other areas, it would be easy to kill. All we'd do is take one leadership change at a low level,

312
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,140
CD's dead, and we'd go back to the old terrible way of delivering the software. I didn't want that.

313
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,900
And so I was going out to the end. So if you understand at the time, I didn't talk to people.

314
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,610
I was, I'm an introvert, but I was an actively not talking to people introvert.

315
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:43,420
But I needed this to happen for my quality of life. Right. And so I was going out to other teams

316
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,100
and explaining to what we're doing in behavior driven development. It's the, I was giving

317
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,020
presentations about it. Just, Hey, you want to have a, what's your team to have a presentation

318
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,740
with BDD. I was finding other people who were coming in from other organizations and who had

319
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,620
a test collaborating with them. Hey, let's, how do we do this better? Later on, when I moved to

320
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:07,900
platform, we hired Villa Sverigraven in the platform, uh, as the he's, he was working at QA

321
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:14,190
at Netflix. And I said, village, you're not my testing mentor and bounced ideas hard and

322
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,510
passed off of him and challenged. You know, I was like, I have this idea and he'd come up and I was

323
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,750
like, that doesn't feel right to me. And I didn't just accept what Villa said, even though

324
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,590
it was my mentor, I would challenge him because it just didn't seem to align with continuous

325
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:32,700
delivery. And so it was steel on steel, trying to get better at this stuff. It all came down to how

326
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,460
do I deliver workable software every single day? Right. It's just, how do I solve this problem?

327
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,580
So there's a characteristic here that I've been going to sound briefly. Like I'm blowing

328
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:49,740
smoke up your ass, but as a manager, there's a correlation. You don't have someone study.

329
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:57,820
I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, well, let me just finish my thought because I think there's a correlation.

330
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,900
There's a curiosity and drive in you. Like you had, you could have gone to your manager and said,

331
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,370
we need to hire testers. We'll, we'll just make them move faster or whatever. Or you could have

332
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:14,930
said there are many ways you could have given up and gone a different path, but you didn't. And

333
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:22,450
that curiosity to go discover, I think it's any knowledge work, being curious and wanting to learn

334
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:27,250
more and continually trying to discover what you don't know and what you don't know, you don't know

335
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,850
is absolutely a key to success. So there's a story in there as well.

336
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:38,610
Full disclosure. When we were making the shift, we also changed tech stacks and the new tech stack.

337
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,890
I was not good at, and I was, uh, you know, it's very difficult to be a senior engineer

338
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:48,130
where the thing that this tech stack, your senior at no longer exists in your area.

339
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,770
You need to become an expert at something quick.

340
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:00,060
So I became an expert at how do we deliver better while I'm learning the new tech stack.

341
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,700
Way back when Brent and I were both in test and he was, I think,

342
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,340
I think we were still doing like kind of old school tile testing, but not the gatekeeper.

343
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,940
Brent came up with this mission. Like, you know, testing's role is to accelerate the

344
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,580
achievement of shippable quality. And there's something there too. Like you,

345
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,500
you wanted stuff to go faster for good reasons. And then, I don't know, I think there's,

346
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,260
I like the story there.

347
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:34,580
Yeah. I mean, and going back to some of the core motivations I have, I've always,

348
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,260
I've not been a developer who's number one software, something hobby.

349
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,820
Okay. I code because I need a tool. I have other hobbies, photographer, motorcycles,

350
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,940
I build models. I don't solve, I don't code for a hobby. I could solve business problems.

351
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,740
I care about the business problem. I push back really hard on developers who say our

352
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:02,270
job is algorithms and data structures. Our job is to be business experts solving business problems

353
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,310
with code. It's fascinating.

354
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,230
Modern testing principle number one, our priority is improving the business.

355
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,710
Yes. And everything, you know, I talked to people, how do you get people to buy into continuous

356
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:19,390
delivery? I don't. I get them to buy into how do we deliver better business value at lower

357
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:24,030
cost with less variability and less, you know, drama, right? You know, it's...

358
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:30,990
But Brian, I am a database expert and I don't care about all of that. I want to add the next

359
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,510
feature to my database.

360
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,110
Okay. Well, go work for a database company.

361
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,750
That is...

362
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,390
But, you know, and then that's a valuable attitude to have. But, you know, going back to your

363
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,070
question about why people think developers can't test. Well, it's because they can't,

364
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,110
right? It's not because that... Well, it's not because they can't, it's because they have no

365
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:53,760
idea how, because you... What's the main entry point for software development?

366
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,200
It's a computer science degree. We don't need freaking computer scientists.

367
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:07,040
We need software engineers and that's completely different thing. And so people go to

368
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:14,700
university, they get a CS degree, they might be taught the basics of how to structure code.

369
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:22,050
You know, they come into the workforce mostly illiterate and then we have to train them. And

370
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,440
if they wind up in the wrong organization, they won't get taught how to test. And then

371
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,560
they'll think that's just the right way to do it. And those organizations will have testing teams

372
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,600
and the testing teams will say, well, developers can't test. That's my job. Only I have the

373
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:45,740
mindset to think about what could go wrong. Right? It's like, apparently software is the

374
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:52,980
only discipline where only somebody other than the engineer of doing the work of designing the

375
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,020
thing can think about, you know, only somebody else can think about what can go wrong.

376
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:02,660
I mean, that's why we have QA teams looking at bridges to decide how that can go wrong

377
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,820
while you have bridge engineers, you know, civil engineers only doing happy paths, right?

378
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:16,020
But they're not taught how to test. And, you know, you'll see me on LinkedIn having

379
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,140
these heated discussions with people who I'm looking at a point, they're looking at

380
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,300
a developer, so I had to test only I have the skills, I need to be the one testing

381
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,220
and explaining to developers what they're doing wrong. And it has to be an adversarial

382
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,780
relationship because that's how quality is done. And I'm looking at going, I'm a value stream

383
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:41,070
architect. You are a constraint in the value stream. That constraint is driving it backsize.

384
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,790
The larger batch we deliver, the more wrong we are because the idea is fundamentally flawed in

385
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:51,710
the first place. That can't work. You need to teach the developers how to test and you need

386
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:59,230
to work on giving them better tools to get that done with. You need to don't grant, right? You

387
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:05,390
cannot be the person doing. If you're an expert, I value you for sharing your expertise and elevating

388
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:12,350
others. If you try to implement your expertise, I hate your guts because you're harming my quality

389
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:21,200
of life. We are on record. Absolutely in agreement. We view like, Alan, what is what's a synonym for

390
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:31,040
specialists on this podcast? Bottleneck. Yeah, you're gumming up the works. You are blocking

391
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,800
the business from achieving its value. Absolutely. In the dojo, the process we went through in the

392
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,640
dojo, like I said, it was immersive learning. And we would go and work with the team for six weeks.

393
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:53,600
It was not unusual for many of the teams to have either an external QA team testing their code

394
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:00,720
independently or to have test automators on the team whose job was to write end-to-end tests.

395
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:09,790
By the way, god damn it, BDD does not mean using cucumber to write end-to-end tests after the

396
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:20,400
coding is done. Okay, Jesus Christ. BDD, TDD does not mean anything tests after coding is done.

397
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,840
But what we would do is we go into the team. And so we have to change the entire way this team

398
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,830
works to go from the way they're working to continuous delivery. And we also could not have

399
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,710
those testers doing what they were doing. People always thought that I hated test that I hate

400
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:44,270
testers. I mean, I get accused of this all the time. I elevate testers when we did this.

401
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,670
We go into the team and say, look, what you're doing right now, not only is it constrained,

402
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,710
but it's a waste of your talent. And whether they had the skill or not, we always granted

403
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:02,910
the skill because we knew that if we challenged them that they would elevate or sort themselves

404
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:09,760
out. Okay. You're the quality expert on the team. The team doesn't have the muscle built.

405
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,200
You need to help them build the muscle. You need to be the coach for this

406
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,990
and stop doing what you're doing now. Stop testing, start being a quality engineer,

407
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:26,500
help these guys learn how to test better. Talk about test design, share your knowledge,

408
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:36,690
share the mindset, share how to think evil, evil ways. And we had so many

409
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:46,350
ex-test automators who were just massive fans of the dojo because we made their lives better

410
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:53,300
because we gave them more important jobs. Oh, when I mentioned when I first went to dev,

411
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,180
one of the things that Microsoft famously did is actually collapsed the test team.

412
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:07,540
And every new dev team was part dev part test. Okay. What I actually found was those old test

413
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:14,610
automators. It was a lot easier for them to start writing code, which felt like a reward to them,

414
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:23,250
but they still kept, they out delivered all of the old school dev experts.

415
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:30,750
I'm not surprised. We used to tell the, what we would tell this test automator is just like,

416
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,550
hey, and if you get bored, pick up a feature because that'll also give you a deeper insight

417
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:41,790
into the challenges that developers are having with testing. You know, pick up a feature.

418
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:48,210
Now, and so this is, this is the big problem though, what we have in the industry and why,

419
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:54,370
you know, one of the, they've, they've hardly released modern software engineering a few years ago.

420
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:00,510
And he sent me a pre-release of that book and I started reading it and I was like, oh my God,

421
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:06,210
that's this, this is the book because it explains to you what you're doing wrong as a

422
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:12,720
software developer. It challenge you to be a software engineer, to take the job seriously,

423
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,960
to apply engineering principles, to, to have the same mindset that you need to be a tester because

424
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,080
a software engineer has to have that same, what could go wrong? You know, I've carried a pager

425
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,400
for 20 years. I guarantee you, I can think like a tester. There's nothing that gives you a quality

426
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,360
mindset, like not having to wake up at three o'clock in the morning.

427
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,080
And well, once you realize it's in your control.

428
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,960
But, but here, this is the other thing, because having a, it's not enough to have a quality,

429
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,440
you know, a testing mindset and focus on quality if your feedback loops are truncated.

430
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:57,180
Unfortunately, so many organizations design the system of delivery to make quality very,

431
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,620
very hard to deliver. Okay. This, this concept of run what you've rung doesn't mean that,

432
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:08,060
that you own all of the infrastructure and everything to deliver your software. What it

433
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:14,110
does mean is that if you build something that when it breaks, you're the person responsible

434
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:23,460
for fixing it. Right. And that is a primary, very important quality feedback loop that

435
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,300
when, when we had an, you know, an ops team whose job it was to do level one, level two support,

436
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:35,860
so many defects were getting hidden until they became emergencies where it could have been,

437
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:40,340
if we'd found out about it early on, number one, we wouldn't have been keep building on top of

438
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:45,060
quicksand on top of something that's already unstable. They're patching together, not letting

439
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,900
us know about, but we could have killed it and nipped it in the bud before we got very,

440
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:56,300
very angry people yelling at us and, and, and, and gotten better at our quality process up front.

441
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:02,380
And so to anybody out there who's in leadership who thinks it's a great idea to have a support

442
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,780
team support, supporting software that a development team is writing, you're wrong.

443
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:13,730
You're harming your customer. Stop it. Move ops into the team, start a page, your rotation,

444
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:19,010
create an L one support team whose job it is, is to do triage, but not to fix anything

445
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:23,970
and wake people up. Your quality will improve. Yeah. That's exactly what did it. My last

446
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,930
company we had eventually we got to a place where we had the L one pagers and they took

447
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,530
care of everything that had run books like you need to bug anybody. We'll work around

448
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:37,570
the clock at distance and we'll make sure stuff gets filed. So it gets improved because

449
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,570
a lot of the run book stuff is stuff that's just going to go wrong. Yeah. And then,

450
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,930
yeah, but then people were, if something happened, they were brought in quickly and they owned it.

451
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:50,770
And I love that. That's the way it's, to me, it's the way it should work.

452
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:54,130
When, when they went through this maintenance, they called it project harvest, by the way,

453
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,610
this matrixing of the organization, we, we called it project Reaper because it just

454
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:04,940
absolutely destroyed our culture. But when they did that, you'd have, you know,

455
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,060
number one, we had no way to train new developers on support because it was only L three and it

456
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:15,330
was only in the middle of the night because we never got day calls at all ever. And number two,

457
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:21,940
by the time we got on, instead of having somebody who was mildly annoyed because their job was kind

458
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:28,100
of getting disrupted a little bit, we were an hour and a half into the problem. And now

459
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:35,780
we're waking up trying to orient to what the issue is, probably have a VP on the line.

460
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:42,270
Got a very angry person who, you know, in the UK or Mexico or someplace screaming at us.

461
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,150
That's the best way to try to resolve an issue.

462
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,590
Yeah, for sure. You know, I've been, you remind me in your talk there, I've been

463
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:57,150
about eight years ago or so, maybe nine years ago, sort of found myself into managing platform teams or

464
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,070
whatever you want to call them infrastructure teams. I don't like calling them DevOps teams,

465
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,070
but you know, I'm talking to you. Please don't call them DevOps.

466
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,430
Yeah, I'm not going to. I'm just trying to appeal to the wider audience. But

467
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,990
so what I found in doing that, like very early on, because I had spent

468
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,510
seven in the industry, 30 years, about 20 years in mostly in test related roles,

469
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:21,070
maybe the last year that sort of more of a test coach, a little bit of a dev in the middle.

470
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:28,580
Anyway, I realized six months into managing a platform team that, oh my God, I have more

471
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:35,300
control over quality in this role than I ever did at any time of my career, because I was building

472
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,940
tools to help make it easier for the developers to deliver as fast as they wanted.

473
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:47,140
Yeah, no, I work for a company that does platform work for the government right now,

474
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,580
and it's a really important job. I can't think of anything better for any developer to do

475
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,700
than to work on platform if they take it seriously, if their role, if their goal

476
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,460
is to help other developers live better lives.

477
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:07,460
Yeah, for sure. And one thing I want to talk more about, we're almost out of time, but one

478
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,500
thing I've noticed in being in this role and then talking to folks in similar teams and

479
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,780
other organizations is often this platform team is kind of treated like the ops team. Like they do

480
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:27,860
the, they do the CI for another team. It's like another pattern. Don't do that.

481
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,980
They get, you got to, you got to build what you run or what do you say?

482
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:36,260
Run what you run, run what you brung, run what you brung. Yeah, I love that. And that's,

483
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:40,260
I want to, that's it. I want to enable teams to do that. Should be the goal of that platform team.

484
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,420
Yeah. I mean, the platform at Walmart, we didn't build pipelines for anybody.

485
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:44,980
No, no.

486
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,820
Easy for people to build pipelines themselves. How can we build a, we don't know your quality

487
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,940
process. Exactly.

488
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,340
That pipeline defines your quality process. All we can do is give you tools to make

489
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,420
that as easy as possible. Absolutely.

490
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,980
And the whole concept of, oh, that's the DevOps team building pipelines for somebody else

491
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:07,700
is the most bankrupt version of, you know, misunderstood DevOps that I can think of.

492
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,900
Yep. It's like, if you can think of anything more diametrically opposed to DevOps.

493
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:19,220
It is. Yeah. Yeah. Especially DevOps is about everything the opposite of that.

494
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,740
I gave a talk at QCon where I talked about the journey we went on

495
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:30,100
and how we replaced a scale agile framework with engineering and logistics at Walmart.

496
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,420
And I talked about this concept of, you know, owning the pipeline. And then I asked if anybody

497
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,220
in the room was a DevOps engineer and built pipelines for people. And I had several people

498
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,060
raise their hands and say, please stop doing that.

499
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:46,500
Yeah. That's what I tell them. Knock it off. Knock it off.

500
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,680
We are just about out of time here. Man, it is so cool to get to hear these stories

501
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,760
and kind of your journey. It's just really impressive. People don't read the lighter

502
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,600
notes, the show notes. So if you want to, I know you have your blog.

503
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,160
Yeah.

504
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,080
Other, oh, and you have your DevOps podcast on YouTube.

505
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,560
Sort of give us the rundown how people can get deeper into the world of Brian Finster.

506
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,360
Well, I have a blog, the five minute DevOps blog on Medium. There's a reason why it's called that,

507
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:28,320
but we don't have enough time to go into it. If you go to blog.brianfinster.com,

508
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,320
you'll get there or rant.brianfinster.com will also get you there.

509
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:38,240
Also, there's an open source project that we started a DevOps enterprise summit

510
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:45,600
several years ago called minimumcd.org. And the goal of that is to create, number one,

511
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:52,240
a minimum set of if you are doing these behaviors, this is the minimums to be doing

512
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:59,250
continuous delivery. If you do that, you will see these benefits. You won't see these benefits,

513
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:03,330
unless you're doing at least these behaviors. And they're the minimum set of behaviors that exist

514
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:11,410
in any context, air gapped, cloud, cat videos, metal and distribution centers. I don't care.

515
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,890
We worked on these really hard. Dave Farley was one of the early signatories on that. He thought

516
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:23,170
it was good. We keep expanding on the knowledge base there, but it's just we learned a lot of

517
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:29,250
hard lessons and different, you know, the core team from multiple organizations, all of us have

518
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:35,220
learned hard lessons around CD. We're trying to make it easy for other people. And just,

519
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:40,560
I want to leave this with people again. You can't do continuous delivery unless you try.

520
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:46,750
Trying to do continuous delivery will uncover so much organizational dysfunction,

521
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:53,630
so many skill gaps that if you just try to do it and just relentlessly fix those things,

522
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,630
you will wind up better off, even if you never get to real CD.

523
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:03,550
That is also my experience. Brian, thank you very much. I do want to personally thank you.

524
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:10,590
Like it was great hearing the story. I had not ever heard sort of the journey.

525
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:17,230
So you sort of landed in the same place, Alan and I are. And when it comes to the

526
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:25,790
mentality around how to do development, lifecycle management. But coming up through dev and coming

527
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:32,270
to that place is a unique perspective that I had not heard before. So thank you for joining

528
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,270
the podcast. Thanks for telling your story. Really appreciate it. I appreciate the opportunity

529
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:41,300
to share. Hopefully it helps somebody. Yeah, that's all we can hope for.

530
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,380
Any one of our three listeners to grab a nugget and go, I can grow from that.

531
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:51,060
Yeah. All right. Well, thanks everyone for listening. I'm Alan. I'm Brian.

532
00:52:52,820 --> 00:53:03,140
We'll see you next time.
