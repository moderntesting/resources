1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
We know Skynet is coming.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,720
It's just a matter of when and we see clues all the time.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,200
A joke aside, that's why I say I went to data science so that that machines

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,080
when the machines tick over the world, they look back upon me with fondness.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,800
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,680
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,760
on testing, leadership, agile and everything else that comes to mind.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,520
Now, on with the show.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,440
I guess to your Kirk, introduce yourself.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,400
Hey, yeah, Kirk, my book on this.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Yeah, I'm very cool.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,760
Thanks for coming on the A.B.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,080
Testing Podcast and hanging out with Brent and I.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,840
I didn't bring a beer.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,360
I had a bottle of wine here.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,600
And there's a reference there.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,040
Someone once told us that our podcast sounded like a couple of guys

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,880
sitting around having a beer, talking about software.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,640
And I think we've only had a drink like once.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
That's when I left Microsoft.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,680
We did my last episode when I was there.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,320
So it's all right.

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,040
We kind of hang out.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
And also we got some feedback when we did our last maybe was our last

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,480
guest on the show, somebody said the interviewers talk too much,

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,960
but we're not really interviewers.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,920
We're just going to hang out here for a while.

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,520
That's our plan for today.

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,760
Yeah, Kirk, Kirk, you weren't expecting an interview, were you?

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,680
I can go.

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,320
No, he he's it's Friday.

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,480
So he's he's listened to a few episodes of the podcast.

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,720
He know he is getting into it.

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,440
Yeah.

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
So fair enough.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,880
So if you were a color, no, I threatened to ask our last guest that too,

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,200
because I don't have an answer for that.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,200
So not only Kirk is I want to talk about what data and what unstructured

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
data is a little bit, what unstruct does will give you, we'll give you

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,560
some plug time, but you've also had quite a varied career going back.

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,240
I think you may have started at Microsoft even before I did.

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,800
Yeah.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,080
What was it?

44
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,400
In 94.

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,600
He beat me by a year and worked on some things I heard of.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,600
So go ahead.

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
I don't know if Brent did the LinkedIn stalking that I did.

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,920
So I, in addition to Blackbird, which was some fire, remember, it was

50
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,080
some multimedia stuff for MSN way back in the early days of the internet.

51
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,040
It was, yeah.

52
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,960
Pre HTML, pre pre web, which is like, I mean, pretty interesting.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,320
So I mean, those days were pretty crazy.

54
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
Do you remember?

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,600
And I think Brent started in 96.

56
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,480
So it was like 94, 95, 96.

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,600
I started January 94.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,680
Oh, nevermind.

59
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm wrong.

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
For some reason I thought I was there.

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,920
I started before you.

62
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
I am, I'm dumb.

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,520
So I remember when we had to get special permission to have internet

64
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,560
access from our desktop computers.

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,640
Oh yeah.

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,360
I still remember when the first guy in the office got wifi and it was like,

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,440
he had wifi and the one in the offices, it was like a whole big deal.

68
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,000
Like, and I don't remember why he got access to it, but it was, yeah,

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,440
he had, it was like the first thing.

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,240
So yeah.

71
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,720
And I had, uh, oh, if you remember, we didn't even have TCP, IP.

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,480
We had, what was our internal protocol we used?

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
Oh, uh, net bias.

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,800
Or was that, Oh God, you know what I'm talking about, right?

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,840
But it's not, no, not yet.

76
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,600
No, it was, it was net something.

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,480
He's, he's absolutely right on that one.

78
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,560
We had our own very noisy protocol we used ahead of.

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,240
That we had, you know, net buoy was what was, oh yeah.

80
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
Then it was, was it land man?

81
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,840
Was that part of that?

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,600
It could have been land man was the thing that Mike, I, you know what I'm talking

83
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
about, there was a, we had our own protocol.

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,280
Like when you installed windows, you had to go install this extra protocol off

85
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,320
this server somewhere so you could communicate, I can't remember what it

86
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,320
was called just, I forgot about it till now, uh, lost cause, but speaking of wifi,

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,440
I remember also having a window CE device, like in two year, 2000, and

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,440
having the huge battery pack on the back where he could also put a PCMCIA

89
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,440
wifi card in, oh my God.

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,320
Yeah.

91
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,020
I did some contracting for wind CE at like when I came back for a bit, but I was

92
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,680
trying to get a startup going and just did some contract on that team.

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,360
And yeah, it was a, it was a crazy code base.

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,080
Yeah.

95
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,360
Yeah.

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,520
That was, it was fun.

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,120
It was fun.

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
I think in some ways that product just couldn't find its niche ahead of,

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,960
you know, the head of its time.

100
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,400
Now there's embedded software everywhere and everything has embedded software.

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,320
But oh well, we made some stuff.

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,440
So, uh, go ahead and going crazy trying to remember now, cause I remember

103
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,120
losing weeks of my life, trying to like literally weeks of my life, trying

104
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,680
to get my damn new computer to get on the frigging network.

105
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,440
And I started off at Microsoft network testing.

106
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,320
I went 95.

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,280
So I, I remember it and, uh, but I, I can't remember it.

108
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,700
Yeah.

109
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah.

110
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:49,740
Yeah.

111
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,620
I don't, I don't miss those days.

112
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
I honestly don't.

113
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,260
Right.

114
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,260
It trying to figure out how to install OS warp.

115
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,340
What the first version of NT came out 50 frigging floppies.

116
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,900
And then if you got one that had a bad sector, you had to hunt the rent.

117
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,220
I hated those days.

118
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,580
All right.

119
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,100
So here we are so slow.

120
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,580
Here we are in the 21st century.

121
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,540
And, uh, so, uh, Kirk, you've done a whole bunch of stuff, um, sort of found

122
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,260
your way into, you know, not only unstruct today, but through some

123
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,540
jobs with data and analytics.

124
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,300
So what was your shift from, and also some product ownership.

125
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,460
So you've been, uh, like, yeah, how, how has that been?

126
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,620
Is it, is it been interests opportunities, a little bit of both?

127
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,260
Like, what's the, what's the story of your, like, I don't want to give you

128
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,780
the whole full biography here, but like, how did you get from A to B to C to D?

129
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,200
Well, I think it's, it's actually interesting.

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,960
I mean, so when I was, gosh, 14 or something like that, I was like, okay, I

131
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,400
want to go to school for computer graphics.

132
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,240
It was like right when that, I mean, it was all coming out and I actually

133
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
started college really early at 16.

134
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,960
And so, but I remember looking and I thought I was like, oh, who has a

135
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,200
computer graphics major?

136
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Cause that was starting to be the thing and nobody really did.

137
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,480
And I started to like looking at computer science and things like that.

138
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,000
And so I guess I always, I mean, thinking of that in the media sense, I

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,840
always kind of started there kind of even, even when I was starting to think

140
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,440
about computer science and in undergrad I did, I did a bit of computer

141
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,080
graphics, but then when I got out, I ended up doing a, like a surprising

142
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,480
number of almost things that are related to today.

143
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,080
Like my, one of my first jobs was, it was, I was working for the

144
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,520
army Corps of engineers for the basically like doing, oh no, I was

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,640
like, no, it was the, it was a Marine Corps contractor in DC and doing

146
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,880
laser discs of maps for, for the Marines and doing basically plotting

147
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,080
graphics on top of laser disc based maps.

148
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,280
And so it's like crazy.

149
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
I think that's almost kind of what we're doing today.

150
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,480
Like our app that we have is using the map box and putting graphics on

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
top of map box.

152
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,800
And so it's, if you look 30 years ago, I kind of, it kind of started there.

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,640
So a zigzag path to get back to it, huh?

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Yeah.

155
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,230
I mean, I ended up doing, I was at a really interesting company.

156
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,510
I was, I was living in DC for like five years and a company that did all

157
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,750
image processing software.

158
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,470
And so they were, I mean, there's still around, which is interesting.

159
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,510
Really like for a lot of medical use and different things that do

160
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,110
some really cool stuff, but I worked on a lot of file format parsers.

161
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,430
And that, that kind of common thread of like reading the header of a TIFF file.

162
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,750
Like I was doing that when I was 21.

163
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,550
And so those are the kind of weird threads that are like still there.

164
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,110
Like I'm still writing file parsers and dealing with like that kind of stuff.

165
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,870
And when I did my masters before Microsoft, I actually did, it was kind of, it was

166
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,190
originally, I was going to go from computer graphics and I kind of pivoted

167
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,030
more to multimedia and my thesis is like basically this survey paper of like

168
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,070
multimedia technologies, which is like really related to exactly what I'm still

169
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,630
doing today.

170
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,510
So that's why I think it's always been an interest, but then I always bounced

171
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,830
into these jobs, like even at Microsoft.

172
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,430
I built the streaming audio control for, for Blackbird, which

173
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,710
competed with real audio.

174
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,910
And so that, that was kind of what I was working on.

175
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,490
Uh, bringing back the memories.

176
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,130
I remember real audio, but they're still around, right?

177
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,490
Or maybe they finally went out of business.

178
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,650
I can't, I can't keep track.

179
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,930
Something's there's something there.

180
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,370
They bought somebody, lots of memory ticklers today from the old days.

181
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,570
Yeah.

182
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,770
I was looking at the time and, and, and, uh, in a prior life, I

183
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:46,890
was the QA middle manager for a media center and particularly the AV stack.

184
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:53,570
And I'm, and I'm now wondering if we had a dependency on anything that you coded.

185
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,450
Cause we, so I was in, I moved over to, uh, Microsoft research for like

186
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,250
three and a half years.

187
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,210
And so I was doing 3d virtual worlds for, for like, it was called the virtual

188
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,730
worlds group.

189
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,450
Um, and that, that was an incredible job.

190
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,330
I mean, every, the people in that team were just rock stars.

191
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,650
Like summer now, VPs at Microsoft and like almost every, the devs and is

192
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,250
now like a CTO somewhere that started a company.

193
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,210
And so it was just one of those incredible teams.

194
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,890
And the, uh, that was, I mean, just so ahead of its time.

195
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,090
I mean, that was like around 96, 90, 96, 98 ish.

196
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,290
And you, I mean, that technology is like this whole metaverse

197
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,250
concept and all that.

198
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,010
Like we were doing that 20 years ago and it was direct, a lot of direct

199
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,170
3d, it was, I mean, network kind of multiplayer technologies and across

200
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,370
the network and, um, but that was, I mean, that was honestly one of the

201
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,610
best projects I've ever worked on.

202
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,530
So, yeah, I was in, I was a dev manager of windows media player at the,

203
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,690
like after that, or yeah, I guess when did yeah, we didn't this media

204
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,850
player, um, right before I left.

205
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,690
And so that was, uh, that was pretty fun too.

206
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,170
Yeah.

207
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,490
I think we had a dependency on windows media player.

208
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,970
And then this other thing that I'm forgetting, oh, the media framework.

209
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,650
Uh, which, which cracked me up.

210
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,850
Cause it was, uh, the acronym of course was shortened to MF.

211
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,490
Uh, yeah.

212
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,250
Anyway, good times, old times.

213
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,930
I liked the current times, um, much better.

214
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,210
So you had to focus on multimedia.

215
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,050
All right.

216
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,110
And that if, if I go through your LinkedIn stock, then I go, all right.

217
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,790
Both to media.

218
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,590
Then he went to another multimedia company, like in a reading

219
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,070
codex and things like that.

220
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,990
And that brings back painful memories streaming.

221
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:51,510
And then suddenly, suddenly VP of product development for stats LLC.

222
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,710
Now I started to get, uh, getting really excited.

223
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,870
Then that seemed to be like your pivot towards more of, um, more of a,

224
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,630
a data as a value product by itself.

225
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,520
Why, um, what it was, so I had a video transcoding company for about 10 years.

226
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,480
And so that kind of sucked up all of my, like a lot of, a lot of my, my

227
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,440
career and then I sold it.

228
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,200
And then that's where I kind of had to reinvent a little bit of like, okay,

229
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
I want to get out of broadcast.

230
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,560
I mean, I was in a media entertainment for so long and I ended up at general

231
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,560
motors, I mean, that's where they actually wanted somebody that had some

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,640
video background and they just bought crews and they wanted to build a data

233
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,480
pipeline from the data, the LiDAR data, the video data, all that kind of stuff

234
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,760
off that they were using, basically recording it, um, for testing and get it

235
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,080
in the hands of their data scientists.

236
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,480
And that was, it just pulled together like all this, like a little bit of

237
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,560
3d that I'd done and the time series data and all this kind of stuff.

238
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,920
And, um, then I, I mean, but the problem is GM is like working for the

239
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,280
government and how quickly you can get stuff done.

240
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,600
So I got a little bored and then got recruited up to Chicago for that job.

241
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,520
And, uh, but I'm a, I'm a big baseball guy.

242
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,960
So it was a cool, like working at a sports data company was, uh,

243
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,240
was kind of a cool thing.

244
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,920
And we're doing like a lot of, um, computer vision, um, doing like media

245
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,880
search and stuff like that.

246
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,600
So yeah, then I, I did like some drone analytics after that.

247
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,680
Um, there was like an IOT digital signage job in the middle there.

248
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,880
And so, yeah, I kind of had another sort of five, six years of just

249
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,040
finding my way through VPC, T O and CTO jobs at a bunch of places.

250
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
And then I started another company.

251
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,280
So one, one thing just as an aside, do you, you want to hear a question

252
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,360
that will make, uh, Alan instantly pass out.

253
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,760
So do you think the Mariners are going to get to fit 500 by all star.

254
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
I all star.

255
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, it's going to be close.

256
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
This has been a painful year.

257
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,920
So we, we, we Seattleites say that a lot.

258
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,280
Man, I remember I went to like 30 games the year they won a hundred and

259
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,960
was it 118 games, 115, a lot of games in the steroid years, maybe who knows.

260
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,840
Yeah.

261
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,440
And then have them that was post that was, was Johnson still there then?

262
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,160
I don't think so.

263
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,720
But in our member, like, I remember, gosh, going back to 95, like, yeah, we

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,760
were in my office with the radio on listening to those games at the end of

265
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,240
the year, it was just, it was just.

266
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,280
I got sucked into it.

267
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
And it's, it's tough.

268
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,960
It's tough to be a long time baseball fan in Seattle.

269
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,160
It is tough.

270
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,880
No, I mean, I've, I was a Philly fan growing up because I grew up in

271
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Pennsylvania and then the, I got, I'd been in Canada for a couple of years

272
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,720
and then came down and then just, I kind of got into that whirlwind of 95.

273
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,040
And I'd just been here about a year and I've been America's friend ever since,

274
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,600
but it's, yeah, it's a painful life.

275
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:55,960
It is.

276
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:03,320
So for me, so I'm more active, more active, actively watching the Mariners.

277
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,320
Right.

278
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,040
It was actually for father's day.

279
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,920
My, me and my son went out and he genetically picked up his

280
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,880
favorite baseball team, being the Dodgers.

281
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,040
And we were there and he's like, dad, you know, everything about

282
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,920
every one of these players you have it.

283
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,120
Dodger's still your favorite team, right?

284
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,520
Dad.

285
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,760
And I'm like, uh, yes, I just, uh, I just don't get to watch them as much as I do them.

286
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,160
Yep.

287
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
So let me add a quick rant before we go on.

288
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,720
So, um, I stopped paying for cable television.

289
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,040
Three years ago, I just got tired of Comcast still using for their internet,

290
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,440
which is actually getting better.

291
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm probably not so angry about it, but I don't watch a lot of live TV.

292
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,320
Um, so I'm okay.

293
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm Amazon has standards.

294
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm big soccer fans.

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
So I can get what I want.

296
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,480
Like T-Mobile gives me like free Apple TV plus, uh, which is going to have the MLS

297
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,840
next year, so I'm excited about that.

298
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,440
But there's not even a streaming, like root sports, which has a

299
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,600
monopoly on Kraken and Mariners.

300
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,520
There is no streaming option.

301
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,360
You can only get it if you have Comcast cable.

302
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,880
And I think obviously there's a partnership there.

303
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,380
Like there, there's some, there's deals that I don't know about, but man, I

304
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,020
would pay, I would, I would pay dollars, like a good chunk.

305
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,020
Just to have a streaming root sports team seems reckless is not there.

306
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,340
Yeah.

307
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,860
Because I lived in LA for a bit.

308
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,660
I was in Austin and I was in Chicago and it was great because

309
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,900
I wasn't getting blackout.

310
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,380
So I could, I could watch MLB TV.

311
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,220
And then I come back here and I'm like, I'm like cut the cord too.

312
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,180
And I'm like, how the hell am I supposed to watch games?

313
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,780
Like I don't want to have to just get TV just for the Mariner.

314
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,540
I hear people use VPNs to solve that problem, but I wouldn't know personally.

315
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,380
Of course not.

316
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,860
Of course not.

317
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,740
And that's your answer.

318
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,780
I'm sure you're sticking to.

319
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,780
That is exactly the answer.

320
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,380
You, you had a follow up question that I want to change the subject.

321
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,020
Cause I'm curious about something, but go ahead, man.

322
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,060
It's all you, Brett.

323
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,060
Unless you forgot.

324
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,980
No, no, no, I'm ready to back.

325
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,900
I could go in and talk about the Mariners baseball.

326
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,340
I can talk about the Mariners for the whole rest of the podcast.

327
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,940
And the three listeners we have are slowly nodding their,

328
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,940
though I would, I'll just say one thing that I will, would love to talk about,

329
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,020
but will not.

330
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,020
And that is what the hell was that last angels Mariners game?

331
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,540
Oh, the brawl, the brawl.

332
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,220
Yeah.

333
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,180
A I'll just say, I'll just say, I think the angels did that on purpose.

334
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,820
Oh, hell yeah.

335
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,180
And they were being all whiny.

336
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,620
And, and it won because they like their,

337
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,980
their manager's out for 10 weeks.

338
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,980
Uh, you know, some secondhand starter pitcher is out, who cares?

339
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:01,220
But they basically took out, uh, three of our major players.

340
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,860
If I'm being Crawford, Jayrod, and I guess winker, I mean, but he's been doing

341
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,340
better, I mean, but yeah, it's, I mean, but honestly, I've seen this happen in

342
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,660
other seasons that sometimes this kind of thing fires up the team and it can

343
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,940
change the season because we've been playing so poorly that lately that like

344
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,820
this may actually set, they, I think I'm hoping the angels like screwed up that

345
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,220
now they're going to light a fire under us.

346
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,900
And we have kind of a reason to like be pissed and actually do well.

347
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,860
And I think the Mariners are just like capable, but they have like just weird

348
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,620
problems where they get in their own head and they just underperformed classically.

349
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,740
Yeah.

350
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,100
It's like the fact that, that we're leading the league in, in, um,

351
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,340
players abandoned on base.

352
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,220
Yeah.

353
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,460
Something about our, our, um, percentage, the average with, uh, bases loaded

354
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,420
is like historically low or something like that.

355
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,140
It's like hard.

356
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,660
And so it's stuff like that is just such a Mariner's thing to do.

357
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh, so then there's software.

358
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,220
Let me, um, let me attempt to put words in your mouth.

359
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,420
Maybe I also, you know, you talked about crack and file formats and

360
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,460
looking at headers and things.

361
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,780
And I worked on, uh, the windows debugger for a while and I got really

362
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,500
into cracking the PE looking inside there.

363
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,900
I worked on GDI also.

364
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,260
So I'm one of the few people that actually in the, maybe not in the

365
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,700
world, that's, that's a little bit too pompous, but I know what's inside of

366
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,420
a font file.

367
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:27,580
Yeah.

368
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,900
So, and I, and I know, you know, I know too much about that and too much

369
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,820
about how true type works, et cetera, et cetera.

370
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,380
But kind of what you're doing today is you're taking, I mean, if we can, I,

371
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,340
let's go ahead and talk about unstruct a little bit.

372
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,300
It's just, uh, I did watch some of the videos and things like you are looking,

373
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,660
you're grabbing data of any format and often, and what I saw in that, in

374
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:56,740
the videos was videos or pictures, which have a known format where some

375
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,660
metadata is there and then adding some more, you know, enhancing

376
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,860
that metadata so you can get more information and find more stuff.

377
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,980
Is that, is, am I, am I assuming too much or is that kind of what you're doing?

378
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,700
You're dead on.

379
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,460
I mean, and I think it's, there's always been this classic layer of, there's

380
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,620
always technical metadata as we call it in the files.

381
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,340
I mean, it's, it's whatever's in the header of the file, the GPS

382
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,460
location and your EXIF information from your iPhone and stuff like that.

383
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,300
And so, I mean, this isn't that dissimilar than like, um, Adobe

384
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,940
Lightroom or your iPhone or things like that.

385
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,420
I mean, they're all, they're all doing that today.

386
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,940
So what we're doing there isn't unique, but that's where you start from.

387
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,100
And then, but the, the next part is we basically are building

388
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,620
a knowledge graph from that data.

389
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,820
And so from the time, from the geo, the geolocation from maybe author

390
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,780
metadata or other metadata that's in the file.

391
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,100
Um, but then the second order of what we're doing is running ML on that data.

392
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,300
And so we're starting with that technical metadata.

393
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,980
We're then doing NLP on documents.

394
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,180
We're doing object detection on images.

395
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,140
We're doing audio transcription.

396
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,700
And then we're kind of recursively like trying to do figure out what the data

397
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,900
is perceiving and then kind of keep spidering down from there.

398
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,180
So that to me is, I mean, the first order is kind of what

399
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
used to be called like media management.

400
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,500
I mean, it's essentially what I, I thought it was or that kind of thing.

401
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,340
But for us, we're kind of taking that to the next step where it's like,

402
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,900
okay, what's the data perceiving?

403
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,020
And then start to be able to search across that and do analytics on it.

404
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,020
Um, and then the third order is what we want to get to is really

405
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,620
um, creating inferences between entities and start looking at, oh, you have a

406
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,380
cluster of this kind of thing over here, or we can audit, do auto suggestion of,

407
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,300
Hey, well these other images look similar and they had all these tags.

408
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,900
Here's a bunch of images over here that probably might be tagged with this.

409
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,500
And so we could do those kinds of things.

410
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,820
So it's, it kind of comes back to you.

411
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,980
I mean, data discovery is kind of the best term that's out there right

412
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,700
now for a lot of what we're doing.

413
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,140
Um, but it's really, I mean, it's, it's semantic search in a way.

414
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,780
And the hard part for us is we do, we're kind of full stack because we do ingestion.

415
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,020
We do this data management.

416
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
We do storage management and analytics.

417
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,940
Um, so we kind of cover a lot of the different areas and terms that are out

418
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,180
there, um, and that's going to be more of a marketing challenge for us.

419
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,900
It's like, like, what are we when we do like so much?

420
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,500
So I wonder if in something like this, you're, you're really providing a

421
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,580
platform for people to understand in your words, unstructured data,

422
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,820
which is a good name for that.

423
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,500
But I wonder if, if the problems companies or teams or organizations

424
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,100
may solve with that are unknown or surprising.

425
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,180
I think it's, it's almost like the platform you're giving people.

426
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,220
It's, uh, I would think it would enable additional innovation, which

427
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,260
would be kind of cool to see.

428
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,980
And that's really where I want to go with this is, I mean, it's going

429
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,260
to open up a lot of greenfield.

430
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,980
I mean, once you can access the data in that way, you can do really

431
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,740
innovative analytics and process automation and all this kind of stuff.

432
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,060
And what we're finding is it's a lot of people like don't know what

433
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,020
they can do with their data.

434
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,140
And so now we're having to get over that hump of, Hey, did you know you

435
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,940
can search like geospatially over the last three years and find objects?

436
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,220
And they're like, we just have this data sitting in SharePoint.

437
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,980
Like we can search on file names.

438
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,700
And I think we're that, like, we're trying to get, like we're, we

439
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,380
know we're a little early, but we're really trying to make a new thing.

440
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,220
Uh, is, is hopefully going to unlock some stuff.

441
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,650
Well, I'm going to repeat a comment and just a, uh, random thing.

442
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,490
That's something I said before, Google makes a wonderful search

443
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,450
engine for the internet, but somehow they can't get searched

444
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,090
to work well for Google docs.

445
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,410
I don't know if the teams just won't talk to each other, but

446
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,210
something like this.

447
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,650
And again, um, I everything I see is around multi-media multimedia on your site.

448
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,050
But when I think actually I can, a couple of public stories I can tell, uh,

449
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,730
Microsoft, one cool thing, they build a search engine as well.

450
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,570
I forget what it's called.

451
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,450
Um, do they still make that Brent is being still a thing.

452
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,980
Oh, Brett, Brett's giving me two fingers to say, yes, I'm not sure.

453
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,300
I don't know.

454
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,340
I don't know.

455
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,940
I mean, who would know who would know?

456
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,660
I have to ask someone at Microsoft to know.

457
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,220
So, so being the thing, but one thing cool at Microsoft was because we have

458
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,700
the search technology is there.

459
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,180
They index their entire internet, which makes at least discovery possible for a

460
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,180
lot of other companies and a Google probably does the same thing for a lot of us.

461
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,100
Hmm.

462
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:29,700
Yeah.

463
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,620
I'm absolutely I, I, I would bet money on it, even though I don't know their system

464
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:41,580
for a lot of companies, maybe like my company, the places to search are like

465
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,020
the data is not only the data is unstructured and separated.

466
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:45,940
Yep.

467
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,300
Yeah.

468
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,260
So when you want to find out about something, um, you may have to search

469
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,500
in multiple places to get to see, see if you can find answers that match

470
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,260
your answers in one place and it's, it's interesting.

471
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,100
So there, there is some opportunity there as well.

472
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,780
I would think.

473
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,260
Well, I heard, um, Microsoft did this thing called project cortex that they

474
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,660
were talking about for awhile and it was sounded sort of related to what we're

475
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,140
doing, but it was probably more like SharePoint SharePoint oriented or

476
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,420
something like that, but I mean, just the layer of.

477
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,180
Yeah.

478
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,860
I mean, we're still, we're not building the ML algorithms to do it.

479
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,180
I mean, we're using cognitive services or other vendors or things like that.

480
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,420
And so we're not competing in that sense, but we're competing in the, a semantic

481
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,500
layer for that data and just providing a really good, I mean, essentially

482
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,220
middleware platform, like a pass, um, for that.

483
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,420
Yeah.

484
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,220
I think as teams, as companies collect more and more data and go through

485
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,700
this, this growth of data maturity, okay, data is good.

486
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,420
We need to collect it.

487
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,620
Then they collect so much and they don't know what to do with it.

488
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,500
And Brent has a highly technical term to describe this phenomenon.

489
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,580
When there's a massive amount of data, but you have no idea what to do with it.

490
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,940
I believe it's called data puke.

491
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,900
No, no, no.

492
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,700
So data puke is when you have a massive amount of data and you build a dashboard

493
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,860
to, to try to, to manually communicate every aspect of it.

494
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:14,380
And so, so imagine, so imagine your worst nightmare of a power BI

495
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,940
dashboard with, with like 50 different pie charts and graphs.

496
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,540
And you look at it and I look at it and it makes me want to puke.

497
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,980
It's essentially, they don't know what they're looking for.

498
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,660
So they show up and so they're, they're literally throwing all of the data

499
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,140
up on the screen and hope they see something.

500
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,340
And honestly, they don't know how to, I mean, they don't know what they're

501
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,220
looking for, but they don't know how to figure out what they're looking for.

502
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,540
So often they kind of stall there.

503
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,760
Yeah.

504
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,760
And I would think that Kirk, what you're building, uh, maybe could

505
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,040
help with that for some companies.

506
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,080
Like we have all this data.

507
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,920
We don't know how to look at it.

508
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,960
Maybe you can get them over a hump.

509
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,650
And that's what we're hoping to do is, I mean, there's, there's that first level

510
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,330
of, Hey, we can visualize it and they can search, then it's how do you

511
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,130
glean one little thread that actually they could like end up in a trouble ticket?

512
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,970
I mean, or something like that.

513
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,450
I mean, it's like something that's actionable from that.

514
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,490
And so we're, I mean, that's what we want to get to is where hopefully we

515
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,650
can, I mean, really in first started furring some information that they can,

516
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,650
they can really find material use of.

517
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,810
But what the initial use cases, I mean, there, the value is honestly

518
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,890
just time and resources.

519
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,170
I mean, they spend so much time manually dealing with these files, even if

520
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,650
they're just like taking pictures of a maintenance yard on their iPhone.

521
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,170
Like if we can save an hour a day, I'm just screwed around with these files,

522
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,890
trying to find things like there's immediate ROI.

523
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:47,690
Now, I, in terms of, so, so I'm now a data scientist and within the,

524
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:55,030
within the culture of the team, I'll say like the PM culture hasn't really

525
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,350
advanced sufficiently enough to deal with, with data.

526
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,830
Right.

527
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:07,270
I'll tell you, look at a PM came to me a few months ago and they said,

528
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,550
Brent, I have some exciting news.

529
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,020
And I've, I of course like exciting news.

530
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,420
And I said, what?

531
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:22,660
He's like, I am going to be able to argue for another 10 heads for your team.

532
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:34,520
And I, I guess everyone at Microsoft is either in a developer or data

533
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,440
science role where all empire builders, apparently, right?

534
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,060
Because I'm just like, okay, that, what do you want?

535
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,740
I immediately went to Spidey, Spidey says tingly.

536
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,700
And, and what he asked for is like, okay, but if, if you, if you accept that

537
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,140
these 10 heads, this is what you're setting them up for.

538
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:05,340
I want you to build an old school curated primary key, you know, you can

539
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,340
think of it as a type one data warehouse for all the customer data for

540
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:17,620
the entire PM org, maintain our ETL pipelines and our Power BI's.

541
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,580
This, this was only the second time I had interacted with this PM.

542
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:29,940
So I, I, I definitely informed them in a diplomatic way that no, I was

543
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,900
not interested in this wonderful opportunity.

544
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,780
Right.

545
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,580
Well, I mean, it's a classic, it's a, it brings up a big thing of, I mean,

546
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,420
data engineering versus data science and how, I mean, there's such a, I

547
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,820
mean, so much of what is just data engineering gets dumped on data

548
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,980
scientists or you don't have what you need.

549
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,940
And so it's, I mean, you're always waiting on the data and it's such a,

550
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,780
I mean, it's such a classic problem these days.

551
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,540
And that's why, I mean, there are a lot of companies that are trying to

552
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,260
help the data engineering side to let you do your work.

553
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,660
So, so I now, so I left QA, went to Devin Bing and in my time in

554
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,340
Bing, that's what the search engine is called.

555
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,740
Shoot.

556
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,100
Thanks.

557
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,210
You're number one, Alan, you're number one.

558
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,330
Uh, but my time in Bing completely blew my mind in terms of like the

559
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,330
types of things that can do with data.

560
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,410
And in, I went back to school, pursued the data science spree.

561
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,250
Now I honestly believe, and I've, I've shared this with my team.

562
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,730
I believe we're at the beginning of the end of the, the, the, the

563
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,930
era of the data science sorcerer, right?

564
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:41,010
Where, where data science is really becoming more and more API driven.

565
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:41,810
Right.

566
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:48,490
If, if I can point unstruct at a bunch of reference storage locations and say,

567
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:54,530
no, and it gets 90% the way there, then you know what?

568
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,560
That saved me a crap ton of time.

569
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,400
It's, I mean, and that's kind of what we're, I mean, we're building on top of

570
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,880
the commoditization of a lot of the ML.

571
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,920
And that's really what, I mean, our big assumption is, look, I mean, there's

572
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,520
going to be a million models out there.

573
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,240
There's going to be low code, no code tools to build them.

574
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,400
Other great partners we can work with.

575
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,120
Um, I mean, it's like, even on just personal, I'm like, we had a data

576
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,520
science and start realizing like, we kind of didn't need that role because

577
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,160
the partners that we had really filled in a lot of what was needed for, for us.

578
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,640
And so we were, I mean, and so it was kind of a, it was a hard thing to do,

579
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,800
but we basically decided just to sunset that role and the, where we're heading

580
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,640
is now it's more just ML integrations.

581
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,560
We are adding in like a auto ML, some auto ML capabilities to like, okay,

582
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,800
here you go in and fit your data and our UI, we'll do all the easy

583
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,880
button stuff, like, I'll augment it, train it, deploy it, just using Azure

584
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
auto ML and give it back to you.

585
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,600
And just for like identifying things in pictures, but that's just an API thing.

586
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,880
I mean, and for me, I'm not a data science at all.

587
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,560
And I mean, I don't even know how to code Python hardly at all.

588
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,920
So it's like, I'm, I'm still like doing all this stuff in C sharp and able to do

589
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,280
like real leading edge ML just with all these tools and platforms.

590
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,360
Yeah.

591
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,040
No, the, the, the only, the only challenge right now, I would say in today's

592
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,200
world on, on the integration, most of it is API calls it, but in today's

593
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,920
world, it's, it's analyzing the output where it needs, where it needs

594
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,240
some, some data whispering.

595
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:39,720
But I think one of the key things that I think you're tapping into, and I

596
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,840
suspect you'll continue to tap into when I go and look at Unstruct, right?

597
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,600
I see you pivoting around, Hey, we're going to make a big portion of your

598
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,560
data engineering problems go away, which is, which is fantastic.

599
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,200
I have many of them and I would love for someone to come in and say, we will

600
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,960
make them go away and you won't have to wait 18,000 months in order for it

601
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,280
to land and we'll adapt and things like that.

602
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,600
But really the industry, as I see it is, is in, is in a space called

603
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,160
knowledge management.

604
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,800
Data is not really what's important.

605
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,840
Transforming that data into actionable knowledge is where it's at and

606
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,240
simplifying it in a way that the, like the human beings can consume.

607
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,840
That's where I see it's happening.

608
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,560
You're dead on.

609
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:31,720
Yeah.

610
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,290
I mean, I mean, that's, it's really funny you say that because that, I

611
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,930
mean, and this is all marketing problems.

612
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,410
It's, I mean, if we say that as a company, like a lot of people think,

613
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,970
Oh, you're just doing document management, you're, you're documenting,

614
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,090
you're somebody like that.

615
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,410
And, um, but we're trying to basically build a holistic knowledge

616
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,690
management system that's multimedia.

617
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,130
And that's really where, I mean, so we started with this unstructured

618
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,690
data term that we've kind of leaned into, but the knowledge management's

619
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,650
really where the future is.

620
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,490
And we actually, we just added document and email support.

621
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,810
Um, or at least we had documents, we added email support and we added

622
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,490
like PI detection and a lot more NLP because we're, we're finding is

623
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,050
as customers, I thought more document management was more of a solved

624
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,850
solution, but they are, what people were talking to actually have a lot

625
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,810
of issues that they have a Google-ish kind of search they can do, but

626
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,130
they don't have that semantic search for a lot of these folks, but they

627
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,690
also wouldn't be like, well, how do I correlate that to a CAD drawing or

628
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,370
an image or something like that?

629
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,730
And I think it's, yeah, I mean, knowledge management, I've heard, um,

630
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,930
Bob Muggly, an ex Microsoft and snowflake guy, um, who I think I

631
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,970
actually used to work under his org when I was there, but

632
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:48,050
so did I, he was up, up until the current executive I worked for,

633
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,970
he was my favorite executive to ever work for.

634
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,530
Yeah.

635
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:51,970
Yeah.

636
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,330
But I mean, I, I didn't know him well, but I knew, I knew, I

637
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,570
made a decent fit there and I've heard him on a podcast and he is now

638
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,410
starting to really talk this knowledge management solution.

639
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:06,850
And it's, um, it's, I think he really gets it and sees like, kind of

640
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,250
where the next generation is.

641
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,530
And that's, I mean, literally what we're trying to do is tackle that

642
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,850
kind of problem that I hear him kind of banging the drum on now.

643
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,080
Yeah.

644
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,160
I haven't, so you spent five years at, and he's at rational AI.

645
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,880
Interesting.

646
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,920
Rational tangent, but I just was at a conference and met some of the

647
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,800
rational people and they're doing some really interesting knowledge

648
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,280
graph stuff for, um, I think like the United nations and stuff like that.

649
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,120
Um, but they're not doing at least from what they said quickly is they're

650
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,160
not doing a lot of unstructured data, like media data.

651
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,400
And so I'm actually meeting with them next week to like, I think there's

652
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,120
some really cool stuff that we can do with them.

653
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:43,840
Right.

654
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,120
If you're able to, to, to with high confidence, the only, the only thing

655
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,200
I'd be concerned, so I do a lot of NLP, I do a lot of time series stuff.

656
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,720
And the only thing would be concerned around is the places where you might.

657
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:07,980
Say it do, do a semantic auto tagging, making sure that that is stable over

658
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,060
time and that the NLP doesn't suddenly, uh, later on decide, Oh, this is

659
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,780
now a different tag.

660
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:16,780
Right.

661
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,180
That's a really important thing.

662
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,900
I mean, like we're sort of have built in kind of ensembling, or we can pull

663
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,780
in models from different like primer and cognitive services and a bunch of

664
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,300
different ones and sort of roll them up.

665
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,180
And then one of the big things we're looking at is like, how do people,

666
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,940
how are people want to can, um, going to handle disambiguation?

667
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,500
Like, because that's going to really be one of the things of like,

668
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,860
Oh, is this an asset that they've seen in their SAP database or is this some

669
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,420
other random term that looks like it or is pretty similar?

670
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,460
And so those are the, I think those are going to be a lot of the other pain

671
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,460
points we're going to have to start leading into more is to make that

672
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,900
tagging work really well is to figure out like how we can offer disambiguation

673
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,020
to the users in an easy way.

674
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,500
So Alan, I could completely start totally data science geeking out now.

675
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
No, go for it, man.

676
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,060
Yeah.

677
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,740
No, I like it.

678
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,740
What Kirk's talking about.

679
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,380
All right.

680
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,260
I am deep in the weeds in some really hard topic modeling problems.

681
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,180
We're doing topic modeling.

682
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,180
Oh, wait, is topic modeling, are those the models that model

683
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,420
clothes for hot topic?

684
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,020
Is that I'm not yet, not hot topic.

685
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,220
Oh, okay.

686
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,580
Sorry.

687
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,180
I was confused.

688
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,500
Go on.

689
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,420
Yeah.

690
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,660
And certainly hot topic would not be coming to me for any modeling gig.

691
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,980
Damn, Alan, you're talking about topic modeling, topic modeling,

692
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,300
your neck deep in topic modeling.

693
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,820
He's like visualizing a mall with hot topic in it right now.

694
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,580
And he can't get out of it.

695
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,140
Yeah.

696
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,340
And he and he's in the glass in front trying to figure out how

697
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,260
much is myself in the mirror and like, uh, Alan, why don't you put me here?

698
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:02,940
And we're doing it against short texts, which is extremely hard and really

699
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,020
relies on sort of probabilistic semantic, uh, understanding.

700
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,380
It's a fun, I mean, if it were easy, it wouldn't be fun.

701
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:19,260
Uh, but yeah, I definitely see kind of where you're going and then mixing

702
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,780
multimedia types and kind of bringing it together.

703
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,420
Yeah.

704
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,820
I suspect you in rational.

705
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,460
Um, I don't know.

706
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,540
I mean, I don't know what your goal is and you're the CEO here.

707
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,300
Right.

708
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,980
And, but it, it, it almost seems like a, a match made in heaven in some regards.

709
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,140
Cause if you can clean up the data, such that it's structured and then

710
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,900
to hand it off to them, then there's an end to end story that would.

711
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,300
I think, yeah, I mean, I actually have a meeting with, um, I think next week

712
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,660
or the week after really did kind of talk because I listened to a talk they

713
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,380
gave and I was like, this is super cool.

714
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,940
Like, and it looks really complimentary.

715
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:02,460
And so I, I just like, they're one of the few, um, that kind of talk about

716
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,860
knowledge management in that way.

717
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,100
Um, data.world is another one.

718
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,740
Um, it's out there that they're kind of in this knowledge data catalog space.

719
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,380
Um, but it's, I think it's good because I'm starting to see more of these

720
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,540
companies pop up and people are talking to talk like Muggly and I was talking

721
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,100
about the global pandemic and we're talking, like, we're talking, we're

722
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,340
talking, like, we're talking, so I think we're positioned, right?

723
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,600
But it's just the classic, like, it's going to take a little time for

724
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:39,560
this market to come to bear.

725
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,080
So.

726
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,800
No, I, I, and I agree.

727
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,600
I think, right.

728
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,680
You said you, you mentioned you listened to, uh, the podcast.

729
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,970
One and a half.

730
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,970
And the half is my son.

731
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,970
He is 21.

732
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:56,970
And it's his first job, but he's actually doing QA automation right now.

733
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,970
So I call him that half.

734
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,970
And somehow your company has survived.

735
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,970
We actually affirm believers in that sort of transformation.

736
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:09,970
Right?

737
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,970
And we now kind of observe that that's kind of the standard practice,

738
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:20,970
that if you realize how to ship software in the current world,

739
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:27,970
you kind of don't need to have specialists to do this.

740
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,970
Right? Now, mapping over to the data space, right?

741
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:36,970
There's going to be the leading edge, which I think you're on.

742
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:45,450
But the question is going to be is how quickly does the main group

743
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,540
really realize, suddenly click and realize, oh my God,

744
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,540
those companies that are doing excellent knowledge management

745
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:01,540
are actually much faster at being able to target what's critical

746
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,540
to move their business forward.

747
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,540
I spent a lot of my time on customer retention and churn problems.

748
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:18,540
And having clean, crisp data would rapidly accelerate that.

749
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
Rapidly.

750
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,540
It would be a competitive edge.

751
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Absolutely.

752
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,540
And I see when we've done some of the ML projects,

753
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,540
I mean, one of the hardest problems is getting good data to train on.

754
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,540
I mean, because we're trying to like, we have drone imagery.

755
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
We have this.

756
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
We're like, I bought a drone.

757
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
And I'm like, oh, man, but like, where in Seattle can I fly a drone

758
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,540
and actually fly over something interesting that we would want to detect?

759
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,540
And it's just that mundane stuff of like, how do I even get like the,

760
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,540
I can run AutoML in an hour, but how do I get a good set of data

761
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,540
to even start with?

762
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,540
And so there are just all these upstream problems that, I mean,

763
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,540
in the data world that are just, I mean, way harder than writing tests

764
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
to test your UI and react.

765
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,540
I mean, it's just a totally different beast.

766
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
I have a question for, I'm Alan.

767
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,540
I come to you.

768
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,540
You're talking about this.

769
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,540
It brought something to mind.

770
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,540
One of the things I've seen happen, fortunately, not a lot,

771
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,540
but sometimes when you have a complex ML system looking over a large amount

772
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:25,670
of data, a bug can bug in the ML or in the data can be pretty disastrous

773
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:30,670
and create poisoned data and just screw up a bunch of your stuff.

774
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,670
One, I'm curious for both of you, because I just know observationally,

775
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,670
I don't work in, although I do like to say that I actually managed one

776
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,670
of the first data science teams at Microsoft just long enough for me

777
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,670
to hire someone who knew what the hell they were doing.

778
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,670
So that's my claim to fame.

779
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,670
When I observed this data poisoning phenomena in the industry,

780
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,670
like these little, maybe not little, but these bugs that screw up

781
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,670
all your good, hard work in practice,

782
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,670
because you guys work with stuff a lot more, how often does that happen

783
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,670
and how recoverable is it?

784
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,670
This is a little bit off the blue, but it piqued my curiosity,

785
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,670
because I don't know the answer and I don't know how to Google for that.

786
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,670
You start to see, there's these companies doing,

787
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,670
they call it data quality, data observability.

788
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,670
Yeah, yeah.

789
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,670
Then what is data, the QA, the testing thing,

790
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,670
they think like, what is data quality?

791
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,700
I'm going to shut up. Go on.

792
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,700
I think I've been listening to some podcasts and stuff where it's like,

793
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,700
hey, we get this report and it's supposed to be updated every 15 minutes.

794
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,700
The system realizes it hasn't been updated in three hours or whatever.

795
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,700
And so they want to auto trigger and kind of then track the lineage

796
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,700
of that upstream to figure that out.

797
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,700
And for us, it could be, I mean, we're using a lot of third party models.

798
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,700
I mean, some, I mean, and we don't even own them.

799
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
I mean, we're not even building them.

800
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,700
It's like, what if like cognitive services releases a bad model

801
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,700
that stops identifying vehicles or something.

802
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,700
And so for those two weeks that we, our customers ingest data,

803
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,700
there's no vehicles. Like right now, I mean,

804
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,700
we would have really difficult time of knowing that other than ad hoc testing.

805
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,700
But I think that's something we want to get better about automating is

806
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,700
like we, for the same data,

807
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,700
to look at what the output is and have basically the anomaly

808
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,700
detection, almost like pixels moved on the screen.

809
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,700
We should, I mean, right now we don't have this and it's more ad hoc.

810
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,700
But we, I mean, once we grow, I really want to do this where every

811
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,700
dependency we have,

812
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,700
we should have a way to track the input and the output of the model and

813
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
make sure that that's not changing. Just like you're saying,

814
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
that's so important.

815
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,700
If you, if you figure out how to do that at scale,

816
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,700
then right.

817
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,700
You earn every penny and a half that you will get from selling

818
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,700
this company, if ever that's your plan, right?

819
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,700
The, the, so,

820
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,060
so not only do,

821
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,060
is it important to do anomaly detection against the streams and,

822
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,060
and Alan, this is how I prevent it. Right.

823
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,060
Because one of the things that happens is if,

824
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:14,060
if you find that your data is poisoned in the way you described,

825
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:21,420
in terms of how to react to it, it's actually,

826
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,420
Alan's it's your favorite answer. The answer is it depends.

827
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,420
The answer to any sufficiently complex question is it depends,

828
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,420
which means my question was good.

829
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,420
Yes.

830
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,420
So it, it, you have to,

831
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,420
you have to then make a decision. Okay.

832
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,460
Do I fill in the blanks? Do I cut it off after,

833
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,460
after the data is recovered?

834
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,460
Yeah. Do, do I do a backfill? A lot of the times backfill,

835
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,460
it's not even possible. Like if you're, if you,

836
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,460
if you're streaming data at like a 10 minute cadence and there's a data

837
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,460
retention policy on the store for maybe two days and you don't detect it

838
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,460
for a week later, it's a lost cause. Right.

839
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,460
We were literally just talking about backfill today with product team of

840
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,460
like, how do we want to handle this? Like, is it time-based backfill?

841
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,460
Like, is it a, is it a, is it a,

842
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,460
is it a backfill of like, how do we want to handle this?

843
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,460
Like, is it time-based backfill? Is it, I mean, different things.

844
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,460
I mean, do you want to backfill?

845
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,460
Like what if you have your backfilling via different kind of views,

846
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,460
do you want to overlap,

847
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,460
and then you're kind of double backfilling data and like it's,

848
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,460
it gets complicated. But I mean, it's something we're actually going to

849
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,460
release probably, I mean, definitely this quarter, but, because it's,

850
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,460
I mean, we have to have that. I mean, if somebody updates a model,

851
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,460
I mean we have to have some way to go back and do it, but,

852
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,460
but the other half of that is how do you avoid poison data?

853
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,340
release a crap model that's put in some stupid tag that they don't want anymore.

854
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,780
Like we were just talking about like the tag muting and tag disqualification and

855
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,620
things like that. Because I think all of that is kind of mixed in.

856
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,060
Because it's tied into the ML quality.

857
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,620
Even then, so yeah, garbage in garbage out. Right.

858
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:03,100
What I'm more referring to is on the garbage inside is essentially,

859
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,220
so for example, let's say,

860
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:11,490
let's say there's this column that normally has five different options.

861
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,290
Imagine it's a column that expresses an enum. Right.

862
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:20,610
And then suddenly out of the blue, option four is uncommon.

863
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,770
Right. Because not only do you have to do anomaly detection against the data set

864
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:35,170
itself, but then potentially against every column and every value within the column.

865
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:43,640
Yeah. Right. So anomaly detection goes just gets crazy really fast.

866
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:50,320
And what drives so there's one feed that I operate today where my team merges in.

867
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:56,110
I don't know, 50 different data sources all owned by different teams.

868
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:01,230
And then then some random PM out of the blue says, hey, I did this

869
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:05,070
this random query that's important to me and no one else.

870
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,830
And then I notice there's this huge spike.

871
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,510
What's the cause?

872
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:16,990
And the number of times during the day or during the week where I have to think

873
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:20,910
through, look, my job is to host the data.

874
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:25,150
I do not provide any data quality off of this thing.

875
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,790
You're welcome. Like if you want to use it, the risk is blah, blah, blah, blah,

876
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:34,710
blah, blah, because I'm like if I open that door where I kind of go through

877
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,390
and answer every one of these questions, that is all I'm going to do.

878
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,590
Yeah, you kind of are ending up taking implicit ownership of it at that point.

879
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:45,270
And then people are going to come to you to guarantee the quality. Right.

880
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,350
Well, no, no. So I mean, that one's that one's easy for me.

881
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,510
You can come to me. The answer is no. Yeah.

882
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,350
If if you don't like my data feed, then go.

883
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:02,830
Then you are welcome to take it over or or build your own like.

884
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,430
And that's one team.

885
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:09,790
So one team wanted me to treat it like a 24 seven service.

886
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:16,310
And I'm like, I'm like, hey, so one of the feeds I operate is really important

887
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:21,150
to the to the business, but the commitment that I've shared out with the business is

888
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,670
is relative correctness, directionally correct.

889
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,990
Right. I'm like, yeah, I am not going to go through

890
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:35,710
and and and try to denoise and make sure all my dependencies

891
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,390
are trying to denoise themselves.

892
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,590
Right. It's that's that's not my it's not my primary job.

893
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:47,750
My primary job is is building data science assets and

894
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:52,030
in any place where this feed where I rely on and it's broken

895
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,470
as it relates to the data science. Yeah, I'll fix that.

896
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,390
Right. Or if you can make an ROI statement.

897
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,270
But the whole point there is it's so burdensome.

898
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,950
And if anything like unstruct can come out

899
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,990
and and even if they only take take a 20 percent

900
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,310
reduction of sort of the manual intervention that I have to pay,

901
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,790
then it's then it's going to be it's going to be worth it.

902
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,270
Well, that's that's one of the big areas that I'm I see

903
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,070
happening in the structure data world, and I'm assuming it's going to happen

904
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,870
in kind of our unstructured world of the data quality and observability.

905
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:31,510
Because like, what if what if somebody is putting in 100000 drone images

906
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,430
and one percent of them don't have a proper lat long in the metadata

907
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,710
because somehow that drone had a firmware glitch

908
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,870
and wasn't writing that data in the metadata.

909
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,150
Like literally, there's zero chance of them finding it unless you can run

910
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,430
like parse that data, show it on a map or show reports or something like that.

911
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,870
Or I have I have a set of like 10000 test images that I got from some drones.

912
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:59,290
Like points are one percent of them are black and you would never know.

913
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,410
It's a valid file, the file size like you could sort of I mean.

914
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,210
And so that's the kind of layer I think there's a ton of value

915
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,850
in what we're doing as a data quality platform as well.

916
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:14,170
Even just looking not at it's sort of a flip side of search

917
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,890
where it's like, hey, here's all this stuff.

918
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,570
But what's all the weird edge stuff around the edges that like is almost

919
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:23,490
not searchable just because it's all clustered together as like black or in

920
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:28,050
zero zero zero lat long or something like that or time is all at the minimum time

921
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,890
time value. And and so I've been I don't I mean, not to slag them,

922
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,450
but I don't think my PM team gets that part of it yet.

923
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,810
I'm trying to teach them about like, look here, I'm seeing this

924
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,250
in the other part of the industry.

925
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,330
I feel like this is going to be a big thing for us

926
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,530
that we need to start thinking about this.

927
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,210
And so I'm trying to like warm them up to the idea of like

928
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,490
anomaly detection and data quality and and stuff like that.

929
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,170
But it's more of a gut feel for me.

930
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,370
We don't have data on it.

931
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,650
No, no, no.

932
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,090
So I'll validate it.

933
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,250
It's absolutely absolutely critical.

934
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:05,290
The the so, for example, one of the things that I'm doing is every data point

935
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:10,170
I've taken to creating a new kind of metadata structure.

936
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:15,490
And in terms of your language, imagine imagine tagging it.

937
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:21,210
But with a data quality tag or in a data quality namespace

938
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,770
where where you're highlighting.

939
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,970
So, for example, I still produce a stream.

940
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:32,770
But if I know if if I know deep down in the bowels that there is a

941
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,890
there is a table where a record is missing.

942
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,730
Right. I'm going to I'm going to highlight in in this in this.

943
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,690
It's basically in my in my implementation to JSON payload.

944
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:49,370
I'm going to highlight that this is a sort of a warning,

945
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,730
like the metadata may not be complete on this one.

946
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,530
And it's important because certain data science projects

947
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,890
I'm working on can deal with noisy data.

948
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,690
Others can't.

949
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,530
And then this allows me to to sort of pre filter these things.

950
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,610
I think you're absolutely right.

951
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,450
Now tagging it in terms of a context around how it's used.

952
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,090
That's going to be a hard problem.

953
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:16,730
We we map.

954
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,210
I mean, so we're actually we're using Cosmos DB today.

955
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,690
Gremlin and the sequel, the JSON document store.

956
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,890
And so everything's kind of in this entity graph.

957
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,010
And we have this concept of observations.

958
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,410
And so we can the observations could be a generic tag

959
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,090
or it could be a person, place or thing kind of kind of entity.

960
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,490
And so we it's fully extensible in that way.

961
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:39,690
That's an interesting we can have like a quality observation on that data

962
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,450
that says like, oh, yeah, here, like this is a way to then pivot on that

963
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:44,970
and search for anomalies.

964
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,730
I see that as something I want to get.

965
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,290
We're too early to like probably a quarter early to deal with it yet.

966
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:53,970
But I think it's something I have a feeling that that's going to be pretty interesting.

967
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,290
I would tend to agree.

968
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:00,410
Right. In terms of so here you're providing the way I think of it.

969
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,730
If you're doing knowledge management and you're helping people to clean up their

970
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:10,410
minute, their their knowledge, I think it's probably just as important as

971
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:15,610
this is knowledge that may be risky to use or

972
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,050
or you shouldn't use at all.

973
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,850
Or like it's like almost orphaned or unlinked at some point.

974
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,330
And it's funny, like I had a bug where so we have a graph view

975
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,850
that we're using this great company, Cambridge Intelligence.

976
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,370
It's this really nice graph react component.

977
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:33,130
And I put like a bunch of data into it.

978
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,410
And I was like, weird.

979
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,370
What are all these satellites around the edges that aren't linked to everything else?

980
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,610
And I realized that those are files that didn't get tagged.

981
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,730
And so because it was like essentially created this tag cluster.

982
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:48,650
And it's weird because like I didn't realize like if something doesn't get tagged,

983
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:52,250
it's not really a bug, like it's not going to throw an exception anywhere.

984
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,170
It's just going to be missing data.

985
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:59,170
And so I was only able to even notice that I'd introduced this bug by seeing it

986
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,170
visualized in the in the UI.

987
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:05,090
You know, and so by seeing all that sort of satellite data that was unlinked,

988
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,250
I was like, oh, man, that's weird.

989
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,890
And then I could like go back and debug it.

990
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,130
But those are the kind of I mean, that's essentially data quality visual

991
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,410
like visualization of data quality right there.

992
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,890
To look for it like everything should be essentially linked to something else

993
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,690
or at least a tag per se.

994
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,090
Right. If it's if it's just orphan with nothing connected to it, that's a bug.

995
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:27,330
That that's actually the principle that I do.

996
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,290
Like this is a lot of times you'll see data entry.

997
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,010
Let's say a data column will be empty.

998
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:38,290
Yeah. And I'm like, look, I don't want empties or I want empty to mean one thing.

999
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:44,090
If it's empty because the underlying source is empty.

1000
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:49,430
Otherwise, if it's empty because we couldn't find it like

1001
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,420
we did a left a left out or join or something on those lines.

1002
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:01,140
If it's empty in that case, then this thing better say missing or not found

1003
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,180
or something along those lines.

1004
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,620
Well, in that area of just that context is I mean,

1005
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,620
if we're running five ML models on something and each one maybe

1006
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,780
reports back like a different thing or why it I mean, we store like confidence

1007
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,300
score and stuff like that, but maybe we had an error.

1008
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,660
I mean, we couldn't run the model because of some reason.

1009
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,500
Right now it's in the logs, but it's not in the graph.

1010
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:27,500
And so that that information of the why we could or couldn't do something

1011
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,660
might be something we want to track in our actual graph and start to be like,

1012
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,300
oh, here's a cluster of issues of oh, we couldn't run this model

1013
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,380
because it didn't have this a lot long field or something like that

1014
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,580
or whatever it was, or it was an image of a black image.

1015
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,700
And so the model just rejected it or something.

1016
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,180
So there's there's a ton of ideas that I have.

1017
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,700
Now, once we kind of get we're just at the point now

1018
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,660
where we're building the graph system, the app, we just launched

1019
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,540
an Azure marketplace a month ago, but there's just a million ideas

1020
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,940
for where we can take this.

1021
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,860
It's that's as it grows.

1022
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,460
You're in the Azure marketplace.

1023
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,860
Yeah.

1024
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,180
Brand has to go look.

1025
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,900
Oh, Azure, for those of you who don't know, that's like AWS for GCP.

1026
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,940
They do cloud stuff, but cooler.

1027
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,900
Yeah, I'm yeah, I have to pick on bread.

1028
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,980
It's funny, my my dev team, they're all AWS guys.

1029
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,020
So we were always like picking on each other about like, which is better.

1030
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,140
So but then I spent all night the other night dealing with I am rules

1031
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,580
in like Azure AD and all that.

1032
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,460
And now I'm like, I was kind of pissed at it for like about 24 hours.

1033
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,740
Yeah, I can.

1034
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:39,140
As a current employee of Microsoft, I am just going to respond with no, no comment.

1035
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,460
I know if you click it, I'll get a I'll get a slack message that somebody subscribes.

1036
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,260
Oh, OK.

1037
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,620
Yeah, then our marketing people freak out.

1038
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:00,540
Hey, all listeners go to Azure Marketplace and subscribe and let's

1039
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,500
freak out Kirk's marketing department.

1040
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,860
Only if you're actually going to use it.

1041
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,260
Yes, please.

1042
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,980
Yeah, we did. We're doing like a starter plan through the rest of the year.

1043
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,900
I mean, it's for us, it's there's just a lot of work consumption based.

1044
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,140
So it's more data you throw into us, pay more.

1045
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,340
And then we're just kind of doing like a flat rate for the rest of the year

1046
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,620
as a starter. Yeah, I think the cool thing and being kind of where you are

1047
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,660
is you're solving a problem that you're solving an important problem.

1048
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,300
Looks like well, that companies don't quite yet know they have.

1049
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,740
Yeah, which is kind of cool.

1050
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,860
It's I mean, it's like I do a lot of investor discussions right now and it's

1051
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,660
like it's hard, like some of them just get it.

1052
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,860
They're like, oh, hell yeah.

1053
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,060
Like this is like the vision of the future.

1054
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,060
And other ones are like,

1055
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,500
call me when you have more customers, more revenue.

1056
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,300
And I'm like, it really has to be a vision thing where like somebody

1057
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,180
really has to see where the market's going.

1058
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:59,260
And and there's a subset of them that totally do and are super jazzy about it.

1059
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,380
But it's I mean, I'd give it a year or two and now it's going to be, I mean,

1060
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,780
even literally just the last six months or something,

1061
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,260
I've been seeing it talked about a lot more.

1062
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,900
So I think the wave is starting to happen with this whole knowledge management play.

1063
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,380
Yeah, I believe it. Definitely. Definitely.

1064
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,700
I worked on Microsoft Teams, my last org at Microsoft.

1065
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,300
And one of the things I would say, like our our VP really wanted to like,

1066
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,860
we're going to go against Slack.

1067
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:28,860
And like I said, no, what you but it's all right. It's all right.

1068
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:34,860
Because Teams is the collaboration tool for teams that don't know yet

1069
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,500
that they need a collaboration tool because it's just part because so many

1070
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,500
companies have offices 365.

1071
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,620
Slack is a tough learning curve for a lot of these non-tech companies to to get

1072
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,300
into. But if you can just take this thing that there's a couple of great

1073
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:54,820
things Teams does is it brings this collaboration and communication

1074
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,300
software to people that just, hey, you already have office.

1075
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,500
You use this stuff. But here's the, it's going to sound a little bit like a jab,

1076
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,090
but it's true. The back end, like file storage for teams,

1077
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:10,290
this may have changed completely, but at the time it was SharePoint on the back

1078
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,010
end. And I said, I'm not sure.

1079
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:16,050
I just listened to a podcast literally about that topic and they said it was,

1080
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:20,770
I think it's still so what's happened after, you know, a decade or more of

1081
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:25,900
SharePoint is Teams has made SharePoint usable and useful.

1082
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,020
So kind of cool.

1083
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,420
One of the areas we're going to look at is do, I mean,

1084
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,260
because I was so surprised that still I was hearing from like aerial survey

1085
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,260
companies storing their data in SharePoint.

1086
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,660
And I was like, really?

1087
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,780
Like you're not even using an S3 bucket or something like that.

1088
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,820
Or like it was just like, and I was,

1089
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,380
I was kind of surprised how prevalent it still was.

1090
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,020
And we're actually looking at doing a more direct Microsoft Graph API

1091
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,420
integration that we can start indexing all of that data better from

1092
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,740
directly from SharePoint.

1093
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,580
And I think that could end up being a, I mean, a really interesting direction.

1094
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,140
You know, another thing I thought of,

1095
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,100
and I know we're over time here and I have to get going, but, but,

1096
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,060
but it reminds me like before Teams,

1097
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:12,100
I worked on a science project and Xbox. And before that I worked on a link,

1098
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,460
which became Skype for Business.

1099
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:18,460
And I remember a conversation way back then saying we really want to do is,

1100
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,700
I don't think we even knew what ML was. You know, we said,

1101
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:28,220
great if we had a way to analyze the text in a recorded meeting and make it

1102
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,940
searchable. And now though, yeah,

1103
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,820
but it could get with, you know, show me, you know, got it.

1104
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,460
You want to go back and revisit how a decision was made.

1105
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,900
Imagine being able to structure that data from a hundred,

1106
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,500
like let's do find the evolution of this and see how we got from there to

1107
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,660
here. And it's actually possible today, which is kind of cool.

1108
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:59,540
It's, I mean, I had somebody asked me, like, it was an investor like, Hey,

1109
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:04,620
could I dump my zoom meetings into Unstruck and correlate back the companies

1110
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,500
that were discussed back to my CRM and make sure they're synced.

1111
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:13,300
Like I've linked to the time I spoke about them and maybe link to Crunchface

1112
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,660
or link to whatever, like in those sort of things. And I was like,

1113
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,380
we almost could do that. Like we're really damn close. Like we are,

1114
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:24,300
I mean, if we have the right NLP to make sure we can get the right terms and

1115
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,700
we, I mean, we, we can already import zoom meetings today and we're already,

1116
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,580
we can run that stuff.

1117
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,380
And then it's the data enrichment that's actually this next quarter is really

1118
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:35,420
focused on. Like it's like, we're pretty much there.

1119
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,540
And almost too, if I look at, like most companies,

1120
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,660
we do an engagement survey twice a year,

1121
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,860
you can almost get a better view of like,

1122
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,900
you never know how it's going in between. You work on stuff,

1123
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,580
you hope it's better. You get the little report, you go, okay,

1124
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,780
we got better here. It works here.

1125
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,220
But there's even for like an HR perspective,

1126
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:55,980
there's things like sentiment analysis or engagement that you could

1127
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,740
actually derive from engagement in meetings, how people,

1128
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,380
the words they're using, the inflection.

1129
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,860
I was talking with somebody recently who used to work for a comp,

1130
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:09,580
a support company and they had ML in real time,

1131
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,140
listening to their calls and like telling them, okay,

1132
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,540
you need to provide empathy now.

1133
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,120
Wow. Yeah. That's sick. That's cool.

1134
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,640
Like we're on the edge of some really cool,

1135
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,760
almost weird sci-fi stuff happening, which is kind of exciting.

1136
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,360
Well, yeah, I, I, that takes to me,

1137
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,160
I mean your story there takes me to a, a, a ethics place.

1138
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,240
Yeah. Don the edge, right? It's the uncanny valley of ML.

1139
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,600
Well, then when you could start having avatars say the words instead,

1140
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,280
because their conversations are driven by ML.

1141
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,960
Like that's where they probably want to go with it.

1142
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,560
Oh my gosh. I realized when I talked to my daughter about it,

1143
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,360
says, what do you do all day?

1144
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,880
I mainly talk to people and try and help them make better decisions.

1145
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,420
AI could totally do that for me. Right.

1146
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,300
Brent.

1147
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,940
That is actually how I pitch what my team's job is.

1148
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:12,260
Right. It wouldn't do it for you, Alan.

1149
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,380
The problem is it would do it instead of you. Right.

1150
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:20,580
That's, that's where it potentially becomes an ethics thing.

1151
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,220
Well, again, we've all seen, we know Skynet is coming.

1152
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,340
It's just a matter of when, and we see clues all the time.

1153
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,620
A joke aside, that's why I say I went to data science so that,

1154
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,500
that machines, when the machines stick over the world,

1155
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,820
they look back upon me with fondness.

1156
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,860
All right. Well, Kirk, this has been a wonderful conversation.

1157
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,340
I even picked up on most of the data stuff. I know,

1158
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,620
I have enough data knowledge to at least know what you're talking about.

1159
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:50,540
And I am super excited to see Brent on the cover of the new hot topic catalog.

1160
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:56,300
That's going to be fantastic. That's one of my great takeaways. But, um, any,

1161
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,100
uh, any final words from you, Kirk, anything else you want to share?

1162
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,300
Shout outs, uh, contact information, et cetera.

1163
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:03,660
Yeah. I mean, if,

1164
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,900
if anybody's interested in just chatting about this kind of data or a company or

1165
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,740
whatever, um, LinkedIn, great way to get ahold of me. Um,

1166
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,020
probably the best way to, uh, to learn about world.

1167
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,510
Cool. All right then. Uh, Brent, anything from you?

1168
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:20,430
Hey, uh, Kirk, it's, it's been fantastic. Thanks for joining today.

1169
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:24,550
Didn't know what, uh, yeah, I'll just be quite honest. Like when, when,

1170
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,590
when I saw that I'm like,

1171
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:29,750
are we really going to be spending time talking about data engineering really?

1172
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:34,110
And then, and then I dove into it. I'm like, Oh no, this guy.

1173
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:38,030
And I get it. You're starting with a data engineering thing,

1174
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:40,790
but that's not really the space that you're in. You're in knowledge,

1175
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:41,310
management.

1176
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,350
I like pleasantly surprising, Brent, sometimes.

1177
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:49,110
But I, but I get it because a lot of people like the companies,

1178
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:52,350
they know they have a data engineering problem and they really have a

1179
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:56,070
knowledge management problem, but they don't really know it in those terms.

1180
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:59,350
Yeah. Yeah. And that, I mean, I think the hardest thing right now is like,

1181
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,430
I know the product, the product we need to build over the next like 18 months,

1182
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:06,230
but it's how to market it and make it click from a terminology standpoint.

1183
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,390
It's like the hardest part right now.

1184
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,190
Because I think getting, because people aren't thinking these words,

1185
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,030
these terms,

1186
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:14,110
when we can have a discussion with people and talk like this,

1187
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,310
they get, they're like, Oh shit, this is like really useful.

1188
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:20,550
But I think for technologists and trying to get the marketing speak is,

1189
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:24,110
is the hard part right now. But it's, I think, I think we're the,

1190
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,470
it's not even just us. I think just the market generally is moving this way.

1191
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,750
And I think it'll be interesting to see other, I mean,

1192
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:33,470
hopefully other companies just kind of make the visibility better. Like relation.

1193
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:34,950
I mean, I think it's, it's great to see if,

1194
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:38,270
if we get more of those types of companies, it just makes the market for

1195
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,110
everybody. So.

1196
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,830
All right. Well, thanks again for being here.

1197
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,350
Thanks Brent for being a pleasant co-host.

1198
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:46,590
I'll try not to, I'll try not to cut too much of what you say out of this

1199
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:48,950
podcast, Brent. All right. And go Mariners.

1200
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,950
You need all the, all the thoughts and prayers we can send.

1201
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:56,670
All right. See everyone. Take care. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
