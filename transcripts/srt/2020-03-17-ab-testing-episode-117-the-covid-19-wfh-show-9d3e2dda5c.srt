00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,660
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,980
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,100
that comes to mind. Now, on with the show.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,260
I don't even know how to start this one. Hey, everyone, I'm Alan.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,260
I'm Brent.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,940
And we're back for the COVID-19 edition of the A.B. Testing Podcast. Does it have a

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,940
number?

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:39,250
We should change the episode to COVID-19 and not the 111 or 117.

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:46,530
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. So as you may guess, and you can never get the compressed computer

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,020
audio to sound quite as good as live, but Brent and I are not in the same room.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,460
We are not.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm in Brent's basement. He doesn't know it yet. Wait, do you have a basement?

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:10,260
I do not. But if you were in my basement, I would know. Your family wouldn't, but I

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,320
would.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,240
That sounds very, very creepy. So interesting times, huh?

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:25,800
Yeah. It's fun being in Washington state right now, huh? Although I guess it doesn't mean

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,340
much to you, I would imagine.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,260
No, I think as I've maybe mentioned on the podcast before, I work from home quite a bit

19
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,220
these days. So it didn't change much for me. What has changed, and maybe we should do

20
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,620
a bit of a segment and talk on the impact it's had on us at our jobs and in tech in

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,800
general. All of my colleagues are now working from home as well. We have, of course, Washington

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,990
is everyone absolutely works from home at most of our other sites. I don't say highly

23
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,510
recommended. People are expected to work from home, but if they need to come in, they can.

24
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,630
But in Seattle, it's no stay home, do not come to the office.

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:20,040
Well, yeah, it's still only recommended, but that's 100% true. It's sort of a super strong

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
recommendation.

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,590
I was telling somebody that, let me just actually walk through from some experiences on my

28
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,030
client, then I'll ask how you're doing, how you're coping with it. I found it more difficult

29
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,870
to work from home at Microsoft. It could have been the teams I was on, I think actually

30
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,030
it varies from team to team and how they work. Or maybe that statement's wrong, and I evolved

31
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,380
into learning it once I began managing a globally distributed team. I was taking care

32
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,620
of my dad a few years ago, and I worked from home for two weeks while I stayed with

33
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,090
me. Hardly anybody even knew I wasn't in the office. I still effectively managed my

34
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,040
team and got a lot of stuff done.

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,180
So then when I moved into my current role about 10 months ago, believe it or not, I

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,540
began working from home more and more into the stage where I was working from home three

37
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,500
to four days a week. And then so we decided to, we should all work from home full time.

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,460
It really was no change for me. Somehow I've learned, and we can reflect on the things

39
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,180
that have helped me be productive and be a regular worker at home. Sort of my evolution

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,420
of becoming a work from home person.

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,420
With all that background set up, what's it been like for you the last couple of days,

42
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,900
weeks? How long have you been working from home?

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,180
It's now officially one week. And I will tell you, except for being able to wear my

44
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,350
pajamas all day long, I find it mostly a downside. So I'm still in the, what is it,

45
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,070
the learning, storming, you know, the little cliche manager speech about team

46
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:04,150
forming. I'm not mastered it. It's a change that I'm finding more irritating than

47
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:12,990
not. You have to cope, obviously. The next hit that just landed, as you know,

48
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:20,630
our governor has closed all schools in three major counties in Washington state.

49
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,830
My kids, my kids just began the first day of their six week spring break.

50
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,670
So is the quad just closing? Yes.

51
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,630
So I'm in the North Shore School District. And not only that, I'm in the Snohomish

52
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,950
County. North Shore School District is going online. So my son has been home for

53
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,310
a week already. His school is fully online.

54
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,150
I think that's because, is that because one of the earlier cases hit up there

55
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,310
and they had time to plan for that? Actually, the first case, the earlier cases

56
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,630
were with retirement home that was literally two miles away from my last

57
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,480
house. But that's still in King County. It's in Kirkland. For those of you, quick

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,240
geography lesson. States in the US are broken into counties and Snohomish

59
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,240
County is the county, one county north of King County. King County is where

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,680
Seattle and Bellevue and Red Bend and all the it's probably the definitely the

61
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,840
largest populated county in Washington and Snohomish is just a few miles north.

62
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,220
There we go. Back to our regularly scheduled Brent.

63
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,770
So my daughter starts online on Monday. They don't she goes to private schools.

64
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,930
So they don't have sort of the infrastructure say that my son was a

65
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,090
high school has. But I guess I will cope. I had a she's 10 years old.

66
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,690
I had sat down with her. I don't know. I don't know what you're doing with your

67
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:03,710
family. I'll tell you in a minute. Yeah. So my oldest that's still at home is is 18.

68
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,700
And I just kind of just bear with it until I can kick him out of the house.

69
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,860
My daughter, though, she's only 10 and she's a bit confused. And so I'm trying

70
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,700
to keep things as normal as possible for her. I told her last night today's

71
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:28,220
officially as the day off for her. But then this new paradigm starts on Monday.

72
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,830
And I'm like, yep, we'll talk about it over the weekend. But you'll still have

73
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:42,080
much of the same discipline requirements as if you were to school. I'm going to

74
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,320
get her up roughly the same time, probably not exactly the same time, but

75
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,720
roughly the same time and try to do some structure so that she still has

76
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,670
that. And then have to figure out the next thing to go is is that I'm worried

77
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,500
about is what happens if Comcast goes down. Right.

78
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,380
Or if Amazon stops delivering. Right. We have real potential catastrophes that

79
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,100
could happen. Well, so grocery stores are still open. I've visited several times

80
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,410
myself. Yep. I went yesterday, put my hazmat suit on, went out. No, I just I

81
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,820
just washed my hands before and after I left. Yeah, I've learned. I've learned

82
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,780
recently how to make your own hand sanitizer. Turns out it's super easy.

83
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,060
Yeah, I did too. So we do you buy a jar of aloe vera and then get a bottle of vodka

84
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,710
and then drink the vodka until you don't care anymore. Oh, you know what? That's

85
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,050
a that's a that's a good modification. It's something like that. I think I read

86
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:54,250
that somewhere. It's again, I think that's a vastly superior modification.

87
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,910
And well, for those who who just want to go with the standard way of making

88
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,990
it, you do need a you get a jar of aloe vera gel. You mix it with rubbing alcohol.

89
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:13,110
The internets will tell you the exact proportions. And if you have if you're

90
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,310
into aroma therapy and you have those what they call essential oils, you can

91
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:25,750
flop in a couple drops of that and then make it a scented hand sanitizer.

92
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,710
Beautiful. You know, I hadn't looked up recipes. I'd have to tell you I was at

93
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,630
the grocery store yesterday as mentioned a moment ago. And you know, they have those

94
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,190
little those stands of things they put up near the register for the impulse buy.

95
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:43,070
Yeah, they had a whole stand of ever clear. So my only thought was that people

96
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,110
were making sand hand sanitizer hand sanitizer out of it. So is it do you know that recipe?

97
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,500
No, but eventually that would work. What's the percentage of ever clear?

98
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,790
But it's like 180. It's ridiculous. I don't know if you can see my screen.

99
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,960
No, I cannot see your screen. Why shouldn't you use ever clear to make hand sanitizer?

100
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,740
Is a website hand sanitizer selling out of the source. But doctors say you're better off

101
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,580
washing your hands. All right. There you go, folks. Yes, that's what I do. We wash our hands.

102
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,140
Our soap our soap expenses are full. So let me I don't know if you're done, but I'm gonna go

103
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,980
ahead and talk about I mean, it's tougher with a 10 year old. Luckily, my kids are both teenagers.

104
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,220
We talked a little bit about expectations last night. And this is actually going to go into a

105
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,180
topic that that you will have some input on. I just mentioned the things we agreed on, we

106
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,180
haven't figured out a schedule yet. I do believe that teenagers work better on a cycle where they

107
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,180
get up a little bit later. So I will let them sleep in a little not until noon, but I'm fine

108
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,580
with tennis. But they know they have expectations of getting their chores done every day. And then

109
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,380
they know they may have a few extra. They have expectations of doing something because they're

110
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,060
not they're out of school completely. So there's expectations around doing something with their

111
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:13,300
brain. So expectations of reading a book. My son is working on a game and Python. He can,

112
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,010
I told him until you've been ready to throw your computer out the window,

113
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:30,940
you're not a real programmer. So keep going. And so my daughter is taking art history class on Khan

114
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Academy for for AP credit at school, she's going to continue that and finish that. But just making

115
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,540
sure they have some intellectual things and then just getting outside, keeping a distance from people,

116
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,060
of course, because who knows which ones are going to be zombies, but just not being in the house

117
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:57,280
all day. And we'll figure out the the actual percentages later. But as as this these next

118
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,520
weeks evolve, but something I did when they were much younger, which I haven't done in a while.

119
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,010
And I know you've done successfully in the past is I'm thinking about setting up a Kanban board

120
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:16,960
for this was swim lanes for brain chores and health. Yeah. Making sure making sure that they

121
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,080
get a certain number of story points done per day in each column, and we can visualize our work.

122
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,160
I want to keep them from just kind of vegging out all day, which would be a really easy thing

123
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,520
for me to let them do. But I'm still in my office working 40 hours a week on phone calls on Zoom

124
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,480
calls like this one for about 30 of those. So I need to count on them to be self sufficient in

125
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,830
getting their crap done without me nagging them. Yeah, it's a hassle. It's around creating that

126
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:59,300
structure. And right now, I'm working as well from home. There's one thing I discovered that

127
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,850
the meeting behavior has changed. Oh, that's interesting because I do so many remote meetings

128
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:15,970
that I haven't really seen that. But I don't know if I told you this, I have a growing team now.

129
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:22,050
After not having one for a while, but I still don't have any direct reports in within 700 miles of me,

130
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,120
closest I have or San Francisco. So I'm curious to tell me a little bit more about the

131
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:39,340
what changed the meetings for you. We now have a whole bunch of people that have shifted over

132
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:46,910
untrained to full time working from home. And the first thing I've noticed is as everyone

133
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:56,740
complains is the hallway chatter has stopped. Yes. You have to find a place to replicate the

134
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:05,250
water cooler conversation. Yeah, you do. And what I'm finding is that they are in fact doing that,

135
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:14,740
but what they're doing instead of asking their three minute question and going away,

136
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,150
what they're doing is they're setting up a half hour meeting. We covered their three minute question.

137
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:26,910
And then it's, I forget the name of the principal. It's an old management principle, one that I have

138
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:34,030
observed a million times. And that is work expands to fit available time. That's Parkinson's law.

139
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:44,400
I spend three minutes on the P zero. And then I, I attempt to do some passive aggressive, hey,

140
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,710
so anything else? And, but then they go, well, since I have you on the phone,

141
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:59,390
can I go through all of my P one to P 250 items with you?

142
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,610
One of the things that's helped out a lot in our transition, and maybe, and I could be

143
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,050
reading this wrong, but the autonomy, most of our employees and I mostly have more senior

144
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,490
employees, they're very autonomous. They figure out what to do on their own and they do it.

145
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,970
They, they, we account on them to do their own prioritization almost all the time.

146
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:26,240
However, a couple anecdotes to throw at you. One is a couple of my teams have set up just

147
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,080
the morning coffee meeting, 15 minute zoom meeting, no work talk, just, you know, drinking some coffee,

148
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,240
asking, you know, how things are going, what's new with them, and that's helped them stay connected.

149
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,280
But the more interesting is, I don't know if you fall on the, the more introverted or more

150
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,120
extroverted tendencies. You absolutely do know that we're both INTP.

151
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,920
Are we both INTP? We are.

152
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,670
It's a spectrum, the introversion part. I like working from home. I don't, I don't miss

153
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,350
seeing people in person. Some people are really motivated by that. And I've,

154
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,350
I've never really noticed the impact of that. Everyone's working from home.

155
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,790
I have some employees who are very introverted. And after a couple days to a week of working

156
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,190
from home, they're telling me, I don't think I ever want to work in an office again.

157
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,790
And there's some people that have been home for a day or two and thought,

158
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,830
and are thinking, I can't stand this. I'm going to die.

159
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:28,660
So just being able to, as a manager, being able to figure out which employees are which and kind

160
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,780
of give them what they need, give them some more, if they need, if they need to be,

161
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,540
if they need people, give them more opportunities to virtually connect with people, do a water

162
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,780
cooler. I know some people are doing an open zoom meeting during the day. They just kind of keep

163
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,060
zoom open. People can drop in and say hi in a zoom meeting whenever they want.

164
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,880
You need to adapt. I think it's going to be interesting. There's been a culture of work

165
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,880
from home for a lot of people. We see them on Twitter all the time, at least.

166
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,040
And a whole bunch of people who are going to now have to learn it. I think a lot of

167
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
advancements are going to be made. So I'm pretty excited about that. And yeah.

168
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,590
Yeah.

169
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,310
So you're going to say?

170
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:18,900
No, it's like my team in particular is mostly introverts. Our usual daily standup has changed

171
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:26,160
from being around 15 minutes to consistently a half hour. And I think it's roughly that

172
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:35,700
personal check-in that you just referred to. The behavior I've seen is, again,

173
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:45,490
my personal autonomy feels like it has gone way down. I am much more beholden

174
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:55,300
to my meeting schedule than honestly ever before. And that may be what is driving me

175
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:02,580
personally crazy. There is a phrase I use a lot, and it's relevant in this case, and that is

176
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,920
too much talky, not enough to do it. And that's how I feel this last week.

177
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,950
I wonder if you'll find underlying... In fact, I would expect that you would find

178
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,750
underlying ways of working or principles that were actually affecting you before

179
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,070
the way you worked on your teams or the way I should say, the way we work in general on

180
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:32,110
our teams in the industry, that will only be highlighted now that everyone's working remotely.

181
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:38,590
I think we may discover some new inefficiencies as well as some new accelerants in how we work.

182
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:49,310
So interesting. So it's like drinking. The more you drink, different people become

183
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,950
different people. I think I can find a better way to put that. People are in a different situation.

184
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,030
They're going to learn some new ways of doing things, and some of those new things are going

185
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,830
to be things they should continue when they go back to their old way or their old situation or

186
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,990
environment. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, I have spent a lot of time just in the last week going,

187
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,910
I wonder what new patterns are going to pop up.

188
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,590
Exactly. And that's what I think we need to pay attention to and highlight. I think on

189
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:24,750
my teams, I actually have a hunch that our work will accelerate as people. It'll be a little

190
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:31,660
slower at first, and then we're going to end up getting faster. We'll see how well that works out.

191
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,580
But I'm hoping that's true, and I'm also hoping when we go back to working in the office, we can

192
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,260
take some of those things that have made us work better and keep doing those, even though we're

193
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:48,880
back in the old environment. Well, yeah, if you can identify it as the cause and then call it out

194
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,200
explicitly, like in a retrospective environment. Yeah, and I think one of the things we can do

195
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,800
as leaders in the software industry on our teams as we're going through this is look for the patterns.

196
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,440
Look at what's working. Look what's not working. We do these same things in retros now.

197
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,480
We can look at it a little bit. We want to look at it through the lens of everybody working from home.

198
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:21,250
Yeah, so do you recall feeling anything along the lines of what I'm doing now?

199
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:30,400
The sense of emotion, the sense of adapting, the sense of struggling through it.

200
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:37,340
Did you have any of that experience? Because I'm guessing not because you made an explicit decision.

201
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:44,540
It was also very gradual. I would work from home a day a week maybe before I moved to this new role.

202
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,580
The impetus for me working from home not wasn't me deciding I wanted to work from home.

203
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:58,060
I would have so many early morning meetings trying to talk to teams in Europe that it would

204
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,460
be noon and I go, well, students noon already. I've been in meetings since six. I'm not going

205
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,610
into work today. So that was really, then that happened more and more often. And finally,

206
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,770
I decided, hey, I don't have any meetings in the office. Why am I going to the office at all?

207
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,570
I could be productive during that commute time. So one of the things that worked for me was

208
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,760
being very gradual. There's a gradual change. I think for most people, the change has not been

209
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,280
gradual. It has been, I'm in the office every day, seeing my friends, having snacks, eating food,

210
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,220
and now I'm home and I have to make my own lunch. Yeah, my wife and I have a standing

211
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,280
lunch schedule on Tuesdays. And one of my favorite sushi places,

212
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,650
sorry, in the world is just down the street from my house. And I was, oh, hey,

213
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:59,010
no commute for either of us. Hey, let's go to Oceana. And it's interesting. She's like,

214
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:06,980
no, we're just going to have sandwiches here at home. So yeah, I mean, there's some impact.

215
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:13,860
There's another one that I've noticed with myself. And I'm wondering how you deal with this since

216
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:22,880
on this call, you are definitely the working from home expert. So I've noticed, I never had

217
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,760
noticed this before, but now it is just super clear and string in my face, the importance of

218
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:42,980
the commute for me personally, to transition into modes. And what I mean is sort of home.

219
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,500
Nope, I get it completely. I understand what you mean. In fact, one time, the time before I just

220
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,820
moved 12 years ago, we looked at a house, I mean, an offer on a house that was walking distance to

221
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:05,460
Microsoft. And one of the reasons we kind of backed out of the deal was that I wasn't sure

222
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,940
what I was going to do without a commute time, because that transition both to and from can

223
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,100
really help. And you get used to it. Yeah, I think still having a ritual in the morning,

224
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,060
a be a pattern helps, it helps my dog, my dog knows exactly what goes on in the morning. So

225
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:32,500
here's my day, I get up always a half hour before my first meeting. Why may you ask? Because I need

226
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,750
that time to in that half hour, I can take a shower. Because normally I have my camera on,

227
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,590
I did not take a shower this morning for you. But I get up, I take a shower, I go downstairs,

228
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,470
I feed the dog, I take the dog outside, I come back in, I get a big glass of water, I get a cup

229
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,870
of coffee, and I make sure that I've rehydrated and had a little bit of caffeine before I begin

230
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:58,190
the day. So I need that half hour. Otherwise, I can't. I'm not a full participant in that first

231
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,950
meeting. Now, I'm not saying you have to start your meetings at six, but that, that routine

232
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:12,050
is my commute. I use that half hour, where you can say you're driving for a half hour, my half hour is

233
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:19,790
me transitioning from my bed to going to work. So that works out. So you need some sort of

234
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:26,750
routine to replace the old routine. The other part is how do I transition out? Now, I used to

235
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,190
end my day, late afternoon, I would run to the gym. I just decided a couple days ago that I'm

236
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,790
not going to go to the gym anymore until things settle down. It's a gross, slimy place. It's

237
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:44,990
probably too much, but oh well. But the weather's getting a little bit better, cool, but clear,

238
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,590
not as freezing outside. So these last couple days, what I try and do at the end of the day,

239
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:56,910
when I'm done for the day, is I go for a walk. And that's where I catch up on the other thing

240
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:02,190
missing from my commute, which is listening to podcasts. Since when I commute in the car,

241
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,790
I listen to podcasts. That's how I stay caught up in all my podcasts I listen to.

242
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,750
I still have time to do that. End of the day, take the dog, go for a walk,

243
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:20,910
half hour, listen to a podcast, come back, wash my hands. And that's my commute home.

244
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,070
And this is my ritual, but I think the main tip there is have a ritual, have something

245
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,590
you do in the morning on your commute to work and something that counts as your commute away

246
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,110
from work. And it's going to be different for everyone. But I don't think the point is to

247
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:39,150
copy mine, but the point is to have one, have some sort of thing that transitions you into

248
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:45,060
the work day. Yeah, actually the work day transition for me is not the one to struggle

249
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,660
with the most. It's the end of work day. For example, this whole week, and I don't know how

250
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,980
long I'll continue to do this this whole week. What is common for me is when it's near the end of my

251
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:04,060
day, I will text my wife and let her know, hey, I'll be leaving soon. And then when I'm actually

252
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:12,700
starting the car and coming home, I'll text her saying I'm leaving. And I've been doing that every

253
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:19,330
day this last week, just because it's funny, because I'll text her and I'll text her, hey,

254
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:28,480
I'm leaving work. And then go, hey, honey, I'm home. Obviously, that's not enough time to sort of

255
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:37,180
drain all of the hot work stuff that was in your head just before you left

256
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:47,970
and into shifting the mode. I think it's something smart there that you sort of shut down work.

257
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,180
In other words, your commute time is part of your work day and you need to account for it,

258
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:03,340
not ignore it. Make it when you're transitioning to this, find a useful,

259
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,360
similar period of time, replace it with something that is not work.

260
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,560
Yes, exactly. Yes, I fully agree.

261
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
I don't have a dog.

262
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,720
Okay, you have legs, you can still go for a walk. Read a book, watch a TV show, do something,

263
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,880
and get out of work mode. But one thing to bring up is for me, because sometimes I will take a break

264
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,520
in the middle of the day to go see what the kids are doing. Or in fact, it's good. In fact,

265
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,480
sitting at your just because you're home, you probably don't walk around your house as much

266
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,160
as you may walk around the office doing things. So it's still good to get out of your seat

267
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,990
and get out of the cave that is your office once in a while. Yeah, do something.

268
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:50,020
Sure. What I've been doing on that front is, and I don't know, I have to think of this,

269
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:58,580
if I think this is good or bad, but it's right now making me happy. As you know, Microsoft is

270
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,100
leveraging Microsoft Teams for most of its working from home adventures.

271
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:12,500
And there is a desktop version and a mobile version. So those meetings where,

272
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:22,080
not all of them, but I would say maybe one in three, where I know it's mostly talking.

273
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:30,400
If I say anything at all, it's talking, I'm not going to be presenting. No one's going to be asking

274
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:39,250
me to do an on the spot analysis. So I don't need to be right on my computer.

275
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:48,370
I'll just take the meeting outside, take a break, go outside. If it's raining, I'll still meet my

276
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:54,530
patio. If it's not, then I'm just wandering around. Hey, I want to throw out one last tip,

277
00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:00,850
then a transitory statement, and then a new topic. So my tip is, can I remember three things? It's

278
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:08,130
a big challenge here. Here, take bets now. The tip is for people doing one-on-ones for the first time

279
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:13,410
remotely. I've done one-on-ones remotely for the last coming up on three years, a ton of them every

280
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:20,050
week. It's really easy to get at a computer like, oh, they're talking. They're telling me stuff,

281
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:27,330
maybe I knew I'm going to peek over at Slack or Reddit or email or whatever. One tip I do is,

282
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,610
when I'm in one-on-ones, I always sit with my arms either folded or behind my head,

283
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,490
and those are in the view of the camera. Maybe it's weird, maybe nobody notices,

284
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,330
but it's my way of showing that I'm actually paying attention because my fingers aren't on

285
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,530
the keyboard. It also happens that I have mechanical keyboards so they can hear if I'm typing.

286
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:59,250
So I will first praise you because I too am one with mechanical keyboards. For me, it's more

287
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:06,370
defensive. So years ago in my career, I had an ergonomics team and I was forming carpal

288
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:12,030
tonal and it was discovered. The membrane keyboards is what was causing it because instinctively,

289
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:20,990
if the keyboard doesn't make a noise, I was pounding it with my fingers to make the mechanical keyboard

290
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:30,130
noise. But yeah, one-on-ones, I'm not having as much of a problem. I'm actually finding,

291
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:38,050
in some regards, I think I'm doing a better job as a manager with working from home with one-on-ones.

292
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:52,580
So what I've shifted it to is a lot more of having them do screen shares and asking them questions

293
00:29:52,580 --> 00:30:02,690
about their work. So it's rather easy. So at home or at work, what I would do is that they had

294
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:13,940
something and then like an insight or what's common with employees. I'm really good at connecting

295
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,300
dots and putting the pattern together. And my team has learned that. And so what we'll do is

296
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,620
they'll come and they'll show me some random spreadsheet or something and then they'll say,

297
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:32,350
okay, do you see anything here? And I'll just start clicking away. And one of the things that

298
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:42,820
I have done that I think is effective is while it's rather easy to ask for permission to

299
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:52,260
manipulate the screen on their side, don't. But I'm finding that I'm using, as I tell my children,

300
00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:00,180
I'm using my words more to be clear around those specific, you know, hey, click this, scroll up.

301
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,350
And then that does transform into more of a coaching learning experience.

302
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,630
All right. I'm going to have you put a pin in coaching. We're going to come back to that.

303
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,990
But I did want to make one call out the transitory statement from my three things earlier. And then I

304
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,270
want to talk more about coaching in the context of quality coaching. So the one call out I want

305
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:26,430
to make is to Ministry of Test. They, I think they're a fantastic organization. I would say that

306
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,070
even if there wasn't a modern testing course on their website, they have had to cancel their

307
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:36,270
second test batch. They canceled test batch in Detroit and they just canceled test batch in

308
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:42,430
Brighton because it's the right thing to do. Very mature. I'm glad they did it. But

309
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,750
one way to support, what I would love to see them do is do some, do an online conference.

310
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:56,670
And I know Joel says free, but I wonder if they did a, I just retweeted Rosie this morning who

311
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:02,590
said the best way to support Ministry of Test right now is to get a pro membership. And again,

312
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:07,950
the pro memberships are so much value there. Even if you don't like modern testing, there's

313
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:14,820
other courses on there. You get so much content. I'm hoping they do something like a pro, a pro only

314
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,620
webinar or pro only conference or pro only webinars or something.

315
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,460
I hope they can find a way to, I think it'd be a fair way for them to try and

316
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,300
keep some revenue coming in during this time when they don't have those conferences or find a way to

317
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:35,700
do virtual meetups, just keep people connected. So big fans, if you're listening from Ministry

318
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,340
of Test, let us know how they can help everything we can do, but it's going to be interesting

319
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,780
economic times for everyone going forward. So I want to just give them a call out and just

320
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,740
please give them your support. So quick comment, and then we're going to go on the test coaching.

321
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,780
Sure. I had not realized that's what was occurring. I do imagine that these conferences are a large

322
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,340
source of their income, right? The ability to do the conferences,

323
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:11,250
Joel's, but the OTC is all mine and free. Obviously, MOT could reach out to Joel and

324
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,450
figure out some of those things. But in terms of it being an income source, not at all certain.

325
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:27,550
I do think MOT is one of the better sources of modernized thought processes on this context.

326
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:36,210
And I would very much like to see them first of survive this. Second, I still see them

327
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:46,050
as a leader of the next stage for individuals in the quality space. And I think it's somewhat

328
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,850
saddening if they don't bounce back quickly and adapt.

329
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,890
Yeah, don't make it sound like the end of the world for them. I just want to give them a little nudge

330
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,580
in the right direction. So I can hear you typing, man.

331
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,310
Yeah, I'm actually going to go sign up for a premium account.

332
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,380
Oh, good for you, man. I want to talk about test coaching, something we've brought up here

333
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:13,540
quite a bit. And it's interesting to see there are more and more people like Rob Meaney and

334
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,900
Marie Charet and others whose names I've forgotten to mention right now who are doing

335
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:26,580
test coaching and seeing test coaching as something that is a natural evolution of

336
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,720
the role of the dedicated test specialist, which we're talking about a lot in our podcasts.

337
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,240
I probably even mentioned it in the Ministry of Test Modern Testing course and in probably

338
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,680
the talks I've given on modern testing. I have two people on my team and my org who I consider to be

339
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:56,300
test or quality coaches. So the role is growing. And then Lisa refers to this,

340
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,900
Lisa Crispin, as more of a test consultant. And it took me a while to take that to heart,

341
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,580
but I'm going to ask you a question. What's the difference between a coach and a consultant?

342
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
A coach has a vested interest.

343
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,160
I guess you could put it that way if you think of the external consultant who doesn't care. A lot of

344
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,040
consultants do have a vested interest. So I think it's possible for a person like when I think about

345
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,520
what I do, and maybe it depends on my definitions, but I drift frequently between coaching and

346
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:37,660
consulting based on context. With coaching, I want to change the behavior. Coaching is more about

347
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:43,550
asking questions. How do you think that worked? What would you do differently? When I switch

348
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:52,350
into my consulting hat, it's more of more direct advice. I'm helping them solve a technical problem

349
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:58,190
or I'm helping them solve a problem versus helping them solve the problem themselves.

350
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:04,880
It's subtle, but it's different. So let me offer a paradigm shift.

351
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,800
A paradigm shift in the middle of our podcast. Jeez, go for it.

352
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,120
But yeah, it's not a tangent. It's a paradigm shift.

353
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,600
Blah, blah, go ahead. All right. My son plays baseball.

354
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:32,480
Noted. You big fan of soccer. Me big fan of NFL. These three different spaces, I'll have coaches

355
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,360
and all have consultants. So what I do is when you ask that question, I go, okay, that shifted to the

356
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:46,670
most common place thing in my mind of where coaches and consultants exist. And what is their

357
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:54,130
clear roles? And then after sort of working through that, let's map it back to the space

358
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:04,500
where Alan asked and see if it fits. For me, I'm very tight with my son's baseball coach.

359
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:16,160
He's paid. But that spirit of payment, like that fiscal responsibility

360
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,160
mostly around survivability, as you know from Daniel Pink's studies.

361
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,760
Finances is a motivator, but it's absolutely one of the weaker ones. Social motivation is

362
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:39,980
significantly stronger. And he takes accountability. It's not accountability in terms of who to blame,

363
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:45,260
but accountability for who feels responsible, who's going to spend the time and dedication

364
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:52,320
to make it happen. Whereas a consultant, I kind of view a consultant as, oh, yeah, here's some

365
00:37:53,120 --> 00:38:02,190
advice. So to take what you want from a consultant, throw away the rest. The consultant doesn't have

366
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,790
a horse in the race. That's the difference in my mind. Well, I think you're thinking of

367
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,710
bringing in the consultant from the agency. I think there's an activity of consulting

368
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:22,110
that consultants do. This is sounding very much like not me talking. But the way I think of it

369
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:28,990
is when I'm coaching, I'm helping people get through habit changes, changing their beliefs,

370
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:33,950
changing their outcomes, figuring out what's in the way of them getting the results they want.

371
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:43,520
So coaching is a lot of times therapist a little bit. Whereas in my consulting hat,

372
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,120
there's a skill gap I'm addressing. So is it a skill they're missing? I need to help them with,

373
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,340
which I do a lot with test coaching. In consulting, I may say, oh, you should look at,

374
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,460
there's a Python library that'll help here. Go look it up and run it. That's consulting. Coaching is,

375
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,620
what have you tried? It's more of the thing you do when I do one-on-ones, I'm coaching.

376
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,320
When I'm meeting with the team to talk about why their velocity or quality aren't where they

377
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,240
want them to be, I'm probably doing more consulting in that meeting. Maybe I'm putting

378
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,680
too much effort into breaking it down. And I know there is a little bit of stigma from some people,

379
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,200
including especially you in this case, that a consultant is this pointy hair guy that comes

380
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,080
in and tells you what to do and takes a crap on your stuff.

381
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:38,320
Oh, no, no, no. So consultants are fine in that case. I'm not certain why you phrase it that way.

382
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,840
I think you said they're not vested, which I read as the consultants don't care.

383
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:58,910
Well, but then, so I would say the consultants don't have a vested interest in you following

384
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:08,960
their guidance. Okay. And when I say don't care, I don't mean that, so there's an aspect of

385
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:18,080
apathy, I agree. But there is also an aspect of objectivity that I think consultants bring in,

386
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,880
that thing you accuse me of, hey, you hate consultants because they don't care.

387
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,760
No, that's not necessarily a negative thing. I'm just trying to differentiate it.

388
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,400
Okay. This has been a little bit of a tangent. I'm going to loop us back in. So I'm going to

389
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,040
ask you a different question. Is it about testing versus checking?

390
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,910
No, it's about my butt. The question is, do you have a definition of a test coach?

391
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:56,080
And then question two is, do you think test coaching is a natural evolution in testing?

392
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,840
Well, we continue to see more and more testers become test coaches.

393
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,580
And if so, I can go backward. And if so, what does a test coach do?

394
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:17,700
So I do, and I'm pretty certain you do too, on do we see more and more of this occurring?

395
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,940
Yes, we do now.

396
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:26,180
Just as a reminder, there's this thing that me and this other person worked on,

397
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,860
of the modern testing principles. And principle number four calls that out.

398
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,100
We care deeply about...

399
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,780
Coach and nurture our teams. Yes.

400
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,100
Right.

401
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,710
So obviously we believe it and we're seeing it happen. It would have happened. And again,

402
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:46,430
the thing to come back to the principles is we weren't trying to dictate some brand new thing

403
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,830
people wanted to aspire to. We've just been documenting what we've been seeing happening

404
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:55,710
in the industry for years now. Now it's snowballing a little bit. It's happening more

405
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,190
and more.

406
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:04,430
Do I see the quality coach position improving or growing? Yeah, absolutely. Do I see

407
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:13,630
it be the place that saves the test community? No.

408
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,670
No.

409
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,550
No, I don't.

410
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:20,590
I think there's a lot of variation too in what test coaches do. So can you sum up,

411
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:27,020
like what are the main, what do you think are the main duties, the main activities of a test coach?

412
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:35,410
Um, you know what? I think you should do that. I'm a data scientist. I've never shifted to the test

413
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,180
coach role. So I think everything I would be doing would be like a data...

414
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,100
I'll dive in because I was just going to correct you anyway. No, I was curious in your opinion.

415
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,740
So I'll do mine. You can give me your thoughts on this. So I think a lot of test coaches,

416
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,340
well, if you can go back to Elizabeth Henderson's Explore It book, I don't know if she called it

417
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,420
coaching in that book, but she talked about teaching developers how to do exploratory testing.

418
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,140
And I've done plenty of that and that's part of it. But what you're really doing at a meta level

419
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,500
is giving developers more ideas on how to test. And that's what a test coach does.

420
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:16,460
I mentioned this before on the podcast. When my boss asks me how well our team is doing at testing,

421
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,940
I honestly can give him the same answer every time. And this is the first place you want to

422
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,290
get. Our developers do all the testing they know how to do, which is good because they're

423
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:32,130
not expecting anyone else to do their testing for them. But it's also accurate in that that

424
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:38,210
statement implies that there is more testing they could do. They just don't know how to do it yet.

425
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:43,010
That's why I have me and test coaches. We don't call them that. That's not their only job.

426
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,690
They help the teams understand what testing may be missing. They help the team understand

427
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,210
what quality processes they may need to improve. Do you go to Principle 5? Is Principle 5 our

428
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,730
quality culture one? Whatever principle is the quality culture one? Four. It's also four.

429
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:06,450
Excellent. Oh, perfect. Four is the coaching principle. So they're helping teams look,

430
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:12,370
they're often running retros for the team. In fact, very often in my org running retros for

431
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:20,290
the team, not their typical sprint retro, but retros on incidents or retros on issues affecting

432
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:25,810
quality and velocity, which are my two main priorities, and helping the team learn how to

433
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:31,490
understand where they need to improve using the quality culture transition guide as a model to

434
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:36,050
discover new areas they may want to get better in. So to me, that's what quality coaching is.

435
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,850
It's helping the team understand more ways of doing testing and helping the team improve their

436
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:45,730
quality culture, their approaches that help them make quality software in the first place. So

437
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:51,250
they're accelerating the achievement of shippable quality on their teams.

438
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:55,330
I guess you could have a test coach for a small team. You could say like on an Agile team,

439
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:01,890
the one tester on a team of seven or so is the quality coach. I think that works. In my case,

440
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:07,860
my quality coach is doing it for much larger chunks of people, multiple teams. How's that?

441
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,580
What do you want to add or detract or? I love that a great deal.

442
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:29,660
I'm blushing. And obviously, so one of our listeners asked, what do we see on this front?

443
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,900
How do we see it? It's relation to modern testing principles. And we see something that's very

444
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:45,390
aligned, very strong. It's unsurprising. Yeah. They also asked around quality engineering.

445
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:57,100
And right now I'm on Google trying to disprove the hypothesis that quality engineering is just

446
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:06,270
a rebrand of software automation engineers. I don't even know. I don't want to figure it out.

447
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,230
And I'm actually kind of surprised you're using Google and not Bing.

448
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,800
Aren't you required by law to use Bing? Because Bing can Google stuff.

449
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,920
Now that was under the Obama era. See episode two or three ago.

450
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,560
I have used nothing but Duck Duck Go for the last few months and I'm not unhappy.

451
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,960
Duck Duck. Oh, really? The first time you've heard of this?

452
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,270
Yeah, you crazy kids and your new angle thingies.

453
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:42,050
It's an ad for research engine. Oh, yeah. You actually, you have talked about this before.

454
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:46,530
I don't know if I have or not, but I got sick and tired of it. Got to the point where Google

455
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,250
showing a full page of promoted links before you can get the actual links you care about.

456
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,640
I just can't handle it. Yeah, it's interesting because I just sort of block it out.

457
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:04,750
Anyway, so quality engineering, we don't know right now. To me, it just seems like automation

458
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:18,830
engineer rebranded. The term I'm encouraging folks to actively pay attention to is observability

459
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:28,850
engineering. I think that one's going to be really keen, really keen skill sets for those

460
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:35,010
currently in the test organization to shift into the new forming options.

461
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:41,810
Yeah, that could be a whole different podcast episode on observability. But we'll save that.

462
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:47,650
There's one quote here from Megs in the one of the three.slack.com, which says,

463
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,930
the quality coaches we've spoken to have been coaching teams to support them on their path to

464
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:59,010
being able to deliver software faster while reducing unplanned rework. It's been all about

465
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:04,450
delivery rather than testing, which I find, and I don't know if I've ever mentioned this on the

466
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:14,210
podcast, but I find that statement wonderful because when I talk about what I do, my role isn't

467
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:19,170
delivery manager or director of delivery because those would be dumb titles. But when I describe

468
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:24,930
what I do, it's all things delivery. I take care of making sure we can deliver as fast as we can

469
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:30,960
without breaking too much. Yeah, in some regards. It's balancing velocity and quality. That's

470
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,400
entirely what I care about. And this goes back to one last thing that I'll let you jump in and

471
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,360
then we'll close is you and I, and this is, I almost threw this out in, I was someone sucked,

472
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:49,280
someone I didn't want into a Twitter conversation, so I ignored it. But I'm realizing more and more

473
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,090
that there are luminaries in testing who only care about testing. They don't give a shit

474
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:01,490
about quality. They care about testing. And you and I are the opposite. I really could,

475
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,850
I don't care about testing. I know it needs to happen and I have ideas on how to do it well,

476
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:13,300
but what I care about is quality. And I think that's a big difference in the transition from

477
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:19,780
traditional to, and actually modern testing has been referred to as the quality school by one of

478
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,660
these, by, I think, I don't want to quote Michael Bolton on that, but I think it's what he said.

479
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,820
No, I guess so. I don't, I don't remember what the schools all are, but

480
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:35,220
yeah, we care about quality, not testing. Sue us. There's space for that. It's not a contradiction.

481
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:43,860
It's just, as long as people understand the scope of the context, when, when someone who does care

482
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:50,980
about testing talks about it, I'm all for people having their passion, right? And, and there is

483
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:58,180
a large amount of space for people who do care about testing and wanting to improve it.

484
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:08,340
You and I are more system based. We care about quality because that's what makes people,

485
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:17,520
a society better and happier. The, you know, principle five, we care about,

486
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,790
essentially we care about the customer's point of view. I think about when we talked about quality

487
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:28,110
coaches, I think about, you know, the, the last type of coach that was super popular, I was the

488
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:35,660
agile coach, and their role was around how to take their expertise that they know and help teams

489
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:43,840
achieve their goals, but faster. Right. And your quote from, from Meg's, right, it's all about

490
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,720
delivery rather than testing. It's that rather that bothers me in that one. I definitely agree.

491
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,200
It's all about delivery. That's a hundred percent true. But I think a quality coach is going to be

492
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,880
focusing on, right? What is, what is the customer experience? What does customer telemetry say? What

493
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:08,160
does customer feedback say? As well as testing expertise and identifying those bottlenecks in the

494
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:15,520
system due to lack of knowledge. And here I will say the quality space, which will include

495
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:23,920
testing expertise. Yes. I'm not saying it's not needed. I would, however, hypothesize that some

496
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:32,530
of these folks in who are waving their testing flag over test. I think one of the things an agile

497
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:38,450
coach or a quality coach can do is recognize the right amount of testing to do for a given

498
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:43,570
scenario. They're good at that risk assessment. They know it's the popcorn popper theory of

499
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:50,030
shipping software. You want to ship software at that. Think of microwave popcorn popping in,

500
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:54,990
in the microwave. There's a sweet spot where you've popped the most popcorn you can without

501
00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:02,610
burning any. That's when we ship. Maybe even then, right? I'm a big believer in,

502
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:11,860
it's around risk control. So very, very small bags of popcorn. If I can, if I can,

503
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:21,660
if I can ship something super small and mitigate the risk, like, you know, for example,

504
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:29,520
ship it under feature flag, turn it on for an hour, then turn it off. Then I get a lot of

505
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:38,780
solid, a lot more solid information. Of course. Then I do with spending that same hour

506
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:46,060
testing. Now that doesn't mean I'm not testing as well. What it does mean is I don't, I won't

507
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:52,540
spend a lot of time proactively testing the hypothetical. For sure. For sure. That's exactly

508
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:00,380
it. So we are out of time. We will do some editing and then we'll get this out and then we'll see what

509
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,790
the listeners think. I'm Alan. I'm Brad and I'll see you later. Yep.
