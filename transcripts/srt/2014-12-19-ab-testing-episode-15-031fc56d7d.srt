00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,690
Hey everybody. Hello, it's Alan and Brent and we're back again for the final AB testing episode of

2
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,530
2014 yes number 15 and last one for the year that reminds me and it's at 1415

3
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,330
episode 15 15 last of 2014, right so I

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,690
Have a question for you Brent not on the whiteboard, but that's allowed in AB testing. Yes to you. Do you prefer to say?

5
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,810
2014 or

6
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:50,690
2014 I'm 2014. I'm a 2014 camp to we got and this it's actually a little one of these little anal peeves of mine because we called

7
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,930
it

8
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,090
1980

9
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:00,330
1990 milk you with Colin 2000 2000 because we called 19 1900. Mm-hmm, but we're in 20s now not

10
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,460
2000s is that over the top over the top? No, it's

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,700
like I was so happy when we got through the

12
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,560
the first 10 years of this millennium and

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,260
I didn't know what the what is that first decade? Yeah, I think you're even okay there cuz we call it

14
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,880
Night. Well, I wasn't alive then despite popular rumors in history class. It was like 1907 so I can go

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,080
2007

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,740
2007 anyway, is it the what's what's the decade? Listen people the odds. Ah, we're in

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,240
2014 soon to go into 2015 if you could all please join me in my crusade to stop calling at

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,800
2000 and I'd be really happy. Thank you very much

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:50,400
This has been a public service announcement from the A B testing crew will now resume with our normally scheduled podcast

20
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,450
You really cannot guess what will happen on this podcast you never know

21
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,330
What's new for you Alan? Hey, I just did I'm glad you asked Brent this week. I did a little

22
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,050
Interview that wasn't like an interview in person where they actually talked to you with the microphone

23
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,010
They sent me some questions that hey answered these and we'll put them on our blog

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,810
I did this for the a1 QA blog. It's at a1 QA comm slash blog

25
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,330
What does it stand for?

26
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,610
A1 like like really good like steak sauce like quality assurance like steak sauce quality assurance

27
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,330
I gotcha, but they've interviewed a lot of people. They have some good blogs up there

28
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,330
I'm some good articles and posts and I answered some questions and I answered questions

29
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,010
That you would expect the angry weasel to answer

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,190
What were those may you ask? I don't remember. No, I answered

31
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,360
There was a question about combined engineering is at the end of all testing and I said yes or no

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,320
You'll have to read to find out. I also answered questions about data-driven quality

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,400
The future of testing and whether testers should actually have engineering skills whether it makes a difference and what it makes a difference and

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,800
My un bashful opinion appears at a1 QA comm slash blog

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,500
Yeah, I'm looking at the title right now. I cannot wait to go tear this blog post apart

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,580
So the title they they took a quote out of the out of my answers and made the title of it said test

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,480
specialists are essential members of software teams and not sure let's tear it apart right now because

38
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,920
We the gauntlet has been thrown down for Brent and I to finally have a little more in-depth discussion

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,120
About generalizing specialists or specializing generalists and what that means. Yep

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,000
So the con I'll give my context then we'll go into that topic

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,140
So my context was I was talking about generalizing specialists

42
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,760
And I think people that have a specialization in test in testing skills and those kind of tester DNA big picture

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
How do things fit together?

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Will remain an essential part of software teams regardless of whether they're called testers or not

45
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,110
Sure, the the only dispute I have with that is that I don't think they'll end up being specialists

46
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,910
I think they'll end up that will be a

47
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:22,310
More of a generalist talent and that it will spread out throughout the entire team. So let's

48
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,190
That's that for a moment and we'll come back to it as we discuss because sure

49
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,430
today on today this week on Twitter I introduced the

50
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,150
The term lost it

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,740
Okay, and I did not see that did not see lost it

52
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,620
I did not see lost it so after reading Twitter and people making comments about you know, I

53
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,540
Don't like what you're saying isn't testing

54
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,100
What I proposed was the law of software testing discussions lost it and you could reference lost it

55
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,420
Anytime a discussion is bogus because the definitions of testing do not match and then someone asked this morning

56
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,220
If we could extend lost it to match term general terminology terminology in general non matching terminology

57
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,840
so let's apply that rule to

58
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,320
Generalizing special specialized in general what is the law the law the law is that I can claim

59
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,200
It's more of a motion. I can claim lost it and

60
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,010
It immediately invalidates a discussion where we're not talking about the same thing

61
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,340
Okay, all right this this sounds analogous to my test is a four-letter word sure

62
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,600
Right. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It applied the test. Yes. Yep

63
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Let's see if we can come to some clarity on what generalists and specialists and specializing generalizing generalizing specialists means to us

64
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,240
So Brett, what's a generalist a

65
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
generalist is

66
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,440
someone who has a

67
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Talent in

68
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,540
Most things needed to get software engineering done

69
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,390
they do not have

70
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,150
The way I would phrase it the difference between a generalist and a specialist is I would say

71
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,010
There's multiple skills that that an individual needs to have across three dimensions

72
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,470
In engineering they'll have process skills. They'll have technology skills. They'll have people skills a

73
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,270
generalist is someone who can

74
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
do all of those

75
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
with sort of a

76
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,630
50%

77
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,130
speed in

78
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:42,130
That's a that's a weird definition. I wouldn't get so complex on that. I would just say a generalist is

79
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,210
Can do a little about a lot of things

80
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,000
It depends right the little about a lot of things. I would definitely say a

81
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,800
Generalist is someone that you would classify as

82
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
Here's my jack of all trades sure

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,090
Let's go with that

84
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,570
Okay, because your other when we went with generals to specialists getting generalizing specialist is gonna get super complex

85
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,050
So we can't make that more a little bit more simple. So general's is a jack of all trades good

86
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,810
I'll say a specialist is someone who goes really deep in an area

87
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,330
I know for example

88
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,210
The guy that does the memory management stuff for Windows is a deep specialist there

89
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,890
He asked him to do the UI or an application. He would just

90
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:33,840
Laugh at you. I will generalize that and say a specialist in my worldview is someone who has a deep

91
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,140
deep knowledge

92
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,180
because I do think the the important distinction between a generalist and the specialist is what knowledge they have and

93
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,750
A specialist has deep knowledge in some

94
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,880
skill

95
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,920
Okay, so now you specified an area it may not be an area right it could be a skill

96
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,880
I'll say a skill very good. I agree. So now without getting too complex. Tell me

97
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,520
What is a generalizing specialist in your opinion your words?

98
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,890
generalizing specialist

99
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,480
Is someone who well again?

100
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,260
So I think of it in terms of more of a

101
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,910
Data science II way

102
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,160
No, so you asked me for me to simplify it

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,360
Yeah, um a generalist blah blah more meat a generalizing specialist is

104
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:43,270
Someone who still has really deep knowledge in a a particular skill

105
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
But they have

106
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,020
other

107
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,120
They have knowledge and other aspects

108
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,020
To the degree where they they can they can handle multiple different skills

109
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,920
but not to the degree of

110
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,600
What they have on the skill that they have mastered so that the difference I would say between

111
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,560
I haven't asked for a difference as for definition

112
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,670
Okay, I can see from your body language my definition sucks. What is yours?

113
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:26,110
So blah blah blah blah blah my definition if I were Scott Amler, I'm gonna read his definition

114
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,110
Okay, a generalizing specialist is someone who one has one or more technical specialties

115
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,510
For example, like Java programming project management. You talk about you know people or yeah, that's more concrete

116
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,270
That's kind of what I was least a general knowledge of software development

117
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,070
Has a general knowledge of the business domain in which they work and actively seeks

118
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,030
Here's the important one especially if people attest

119
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:54,150
They're good at this actively seeks to gain new skills and both their existing specialties as well as in other areas

120
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Okay. All right

121
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Any and Scott am was articles like when I come out 2007 8 it's pretty old. So what he's saying is

122
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Similar to what I was saying is that?

123
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,080
As one or more your words one or more technical specialties

124
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,000
The one problem I would the one tweak I would have with that is it still would be a limited number of technical specialties

125
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,390
a basic knowledge of how to do stuff

126
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,470
basic knowledge of the goals that they're trying to achieve and

127
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,070
Learns good. So what's a specializing generalist is a term that's not used as much but you like it a lot

128
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,190
So tell me what a specialized generalism

129
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,030
I don't have a fancy definition from someone important to read for this one. So we're gonna have to trust Brent stay tuned

130
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,530
It's it's the reverse of this

131
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,650
so they have a general knowledge of

132
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,990
All or most of the technical

133
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,070
Skill, so they're broader. They're broader. Okay

134
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,920
And they're actively seeking to gain new skills

135
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,810
Deeper in a new specialty

136
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,610
So so both both sides if you were to run them as sort of an iterative loop

137
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,830
I do think you would see both generalizing specialists and specializing generalists

138
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,950
Converged to a steady state. I okay. I think we're more in agreement which sucks for our listeners who wanted to fight

139
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,510
But I read I tweeted about this as well and Jim Holmes

140
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:40,690
Because at first I read Scott Ambler who later in the same article says there's a lines of something like

141
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,430
What then what the heck is a can there be a specialized in generalist and he says basically I?

142
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,390
Guess so just a different path to get there. Although he says it's rare. Maybe it's not so rare

143
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,790
but you're saying that the specializing generalist is

144
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,270
Mostly a general to specializes and the generalizing specialists mostly a specialist who can go a bit broader

145
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,690
But eventually yes, which those will converge as you go as they both go

146
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,350
Because they're both have to share that attribute of wanting to learn new things eventually they sort of converge

147
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:19,270
Yeah, so the way we could we could discuss this further like if if we both intuitively

148
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,990
intuitively

149
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,310
Believe we had a couple beers before we started at 8 in the morning, so your friends having a hard time

150
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,350
That that they would likely converge

151
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,470
to

152
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,200
the same whichever it may be

153
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
right

154
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Then really the discussion is

155
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
If you were to start a new team

156
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,250
What should it be?

157
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,880
Where do you start and in most of the blogs that I've seen that the advocate for?

158
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
generalizing specialists

159
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,280
My perception is the the battle that they're solving is they're trying to

160
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,840
they're not trying to solve the combined engineering problem that we are but they're trying to

161
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,420
essentially get pure dev orgs

162
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:15,720
to stop being stupid because pure dev orgs at least in the world that we're coming from is

163
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,640
Is a world of pure specialization? Yeah, and that doesn't work no

164
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,290
So I tweeted this and asked if there was a difference because I read the Scott Ambler article

165
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,490
I thought well, you know and I kind of got to that convergence point that you got to I thought maybe they're the same

166
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:39,970
But until they're the same they're different until they converge they are different and Jim Holmes who's an awesome, dude

167
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,810
I met him a couple years ago to peer conference and that he was organizing and hosting. He was part of Telerik

168
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,280
I

169
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,880
Said he wrote an article again six years ago

170
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,280
Talked about being a specialized in generalist and and I kind of got that there is a difference and

171
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,820
He's a generalist first and dives deep where needed. So let's play a game. Okay

172
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,560
I only have one round of this game because I just made it up right now tag. You're it

173
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,830
so my role

174
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
What do I do at work? I?

175
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Am kind of a consultant for the team

176
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,580
Okay, my boss calls me that I look at what's going on

177
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,880
I figure out where holes are make sure they're gonna make sure they're getting addressed make sure we're not

178
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,780
Letting pieces fall through the cracks. I also spent a lot of time on this team because we don't have anyone managing in charge of managing

179
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,960
our builds

180
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,180
tweaking a lot of our build configurations making sure people get help with

181
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,400
Get and source control when they need it because it's new for a lot of people

182
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,880
optimizing tweaking

183
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,200
Set up some new static analysis tools for the team

184
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,240
Got those up and running so we can you know, I'm big on code hygiene and code sanity in the past

185
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,680
I've done similar sort of things and also written some

186
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,400
infrastructure tools

187
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,720
but at the same time kind of did a lot of

188
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,080
leadership things making sure that whether there are virtual teams another conversation what virtual teams or

189
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,380
Directives that we need that the team needed to follow we're taking making care of team-wide communication, etc

190
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,140
Kind of the things I do is I'm big on community. I'm big on learning from others. I'm big on sharing. I'm big on

191
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,060
Enabling people to do a better job

192
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,400
What am I am I a generalizing specialist or specializing generalist I

193
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,480
The way you just described I think you're specializing general. Yeah, that's it's interesting

194
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,560
That's the realization I came to as I began researching this which is weird because I've been going to a specialist and

195
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
and

196
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,320
And I can I give him a tiny Python flashback right there Oh

197
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,560
Time out I'm going to it's probably too young at almost 11 years old but over one of my goals over

198
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Winter break is to have my son watch money Python on the Holy Grail for the first time

199
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,880
Maybe not entirely appropriate, but I think he's silly enough that he would enjoy the humor

200
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,800
I think my youngest son as well

201
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,560
And I absolutely feel like I have not done my parental duty by introducing them to flying circuit

202
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,400
Yeah, so that's gonna happen. That's that that's gonna happen. We'll see how that goes

203
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,460
My daughter may just roll her eyes and leave the room and go play with makeup or something

204
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,280
My daughter is just about to turn five

205
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,220
She would yeah, she would immediately bit flip and leave

206
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:30,040
But I think if I my old my youngest son would be all in and I think I could get I get it apply social pressure

207
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,680
I'm gonna give it a shot. You know we did this weekend and we're off in the weeds

208
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I'm gonna come back to the specialized and generalist is

209
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,440
There's a school of rock wreck a mile from Microsoft

210
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,800
And you know that's a great movie and I made the kids watch the movie in fact

211
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,380
My daughter had a friend over we called her mom make sure we could watch a PG-13 movie

212
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,640
And it was it was like barely PG-13 and and yeah

213
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,280
It was I forgot how awesome Jack Black is and that whole movie was great

214
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,960
I would say how awesome Jack Black used to be perhaps

215
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,080
All right, so I came the realization that I was a specialized in generalist so by your own definition

216
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,510
You are suboptimal. I right. No, I've changed my definition

217
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,030
once I realized that I kind of what I do is more of a I

218
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,500
Yeah, I know a lot about a little little about a lot

219
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,840
I do always learn new things and go as deep as I need to to help the team

220
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,940
So here's not usually a lot deeper. Here's here's the realization

221
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
just so that you don't

222
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,820
Feel alienated or lost out or where did I go wrong?

223
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,860
Yeah every day as I cry in the corner. I think those things so

224
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,200
As I guess just got through those who grew up in particularly at this company those who grew up in dev

225
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Are used to being a specialist it's still whenever I introduce teams to agile that is the number one

226
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,560
conflict I have when I introduced this to

227
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,140
We'll call them dev teams who grew up in dev even though everything's combined engineering now

228
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
Tess is the reverse

229
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Right. We've talked many a times that when when we had these separated roles

230
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,340
Test was the guys trained to fill in the blanks. So we got talented at blank filling

231
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,840
Yeah, our friend Jim Moore who listens once in a while says that you said the job of test is the remainder

232
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,870
Yeah, I

233
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,420
Love Jim don't like that. I I like it. I I what you just said in different words. No, no, it's a it's a hundred percent

234
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,020
Right and I still hate it

235
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,070
I

236
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,110
And then I even wrote a blog on on that topic. Gosh a year ago

237
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,950
Do you blog anymore? I will get another one out

238
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,180
In the before the end of this into this year actually ideally this weekend stay tuned. Yep

239
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,520
But one of the things that that I have

240
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,140
done

241
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,100
is

242
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,570
I've

243
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,210
Watched I've I've owned teams that came from both backgrounds

244
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,330
Okay

245
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,010
and when you get into the the agile process that they're

246
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,620
Let me take a step back

247
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:33,100
You you from a technical standpoint, I would definitely classify you as a generalist

248
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,610
however

249
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:43,490
You are a specialist in certain things. So I definitely think that for example learning knowledge sharing that is a specialty

250
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,610
You have beyond the shadow of a doubt, right?

251
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,650
New tech

252
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,780
You're you're not afraid to go deep and you are able to go deep

253
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,880
Just about any time the business needs it the difference

254
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,460
From from my point of view between a generalizing specialist and a specializing generalist

255
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:16,820
a specialization in the agile world as we've talked before is another name for

256
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,980
Team bottleneck. So the challenge comes into play is when there's a specialization

257
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:30,140
We're the only specialist you're the only specialist and the worst case scenario is you're the only specialist in a

258
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
specialization that the team no longer needs

259
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,190
for example

260
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,280
let's say

261
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,640
You are work. You are working on a UI database product and you're the database specialist and

262
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,500
they decide to go a different direction and

263
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,980
We no longer need that database. We're gonna outsource that database to a third party

264
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,140
What do you do get a new job? That's exactly what you do

265
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,500
Yeah, but if you're a specializing generalist, what do you do?

266
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,140
You pick one of your other general areas and fill in or find another area specialty you find another area

267
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
That's true for a specializing generalist as well

268
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,860
the anxiety is

269
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:19,040
Significantly different I guess so there's that sort of a lot of people have mentioned. I know Lisa Crispin has I'm not sure if

270
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,960
If it's hers or she got up somewhere else. Sorry, but the tree shaped persona where you have the T shaped persona where you're broad

271
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,040
You go deep, but then somebody says well, there's other places that go maybe not quite as deep

272
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,080
Yeah with my hands you guys can't see it, but I think

273
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,270
Yeah to be successful in software

274
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:43,630
You can't just be a trunk of a tree need some breath and you need some branches and vines dangling down areas where you know

275
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,270
Where you can dive in what I would say is the this is actually an interesting discussion

276
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,470
The oh my gosh, it's actually interesting. Thanks for telling everyone Brent. Sorry

277
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,870
every now and again

278
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,230
Alan

279
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,230
Pull something useful out

280
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:07,350
So if specialization can turn into a problem around bottlenecking

281
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,440
then then is it true and I believe it is the generalization means a

282
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
generalist might be a

283
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
specialist in adaptability

284
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,880
Yes, but they do have the week is like discussing mutant powered strengths and weaknesses

285
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,000
you need

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Know when you have a complex performance problem the generals can't help you you need the purse

287
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,200
you need somebody with with strengths in performance or or

288
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,480
Specialty and performance as part of their tool bag to help with that. I would argue the generalists can help you

289
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,700
But it may not be in an effective time frame. Yes, okay

290
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,480
Because and I would say the generals may help you as they ramp up specialty in that area in order to help you

291
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,640
That's maybe why the time frame is long. Yes, okay. Yeah

292
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,120
So all that said I don't see a test specialist

293
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,160
So this is a and in context of the article, it's a a test special someone who's a generalizing specialist

294
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:19,360
Where there or a specializing generalist? Let's talk about me for example, and but I still consider myself a test specialist

295
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,480
I know a lot about approaches for testing

296
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,320
I help our dev team a lot and how they're writing their tests now. They're executing their tests. I'm actually I shouldn't say our dev team my team

297
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,560
that happened to be programmers who are purely specialists in programming to

298
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,750
Broaden their ability to write

299
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,970
Unit functional and acceptance tests to journey that is a test specialist a team is always going to needs

300
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,810
I'm stopping you there. Is that a test specialist or a test specialization?

301
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,730
It's a test specialization

302
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:57,090
So I guess I think I get the part so if that is all you did that you are taking offense that is because I call

303
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:03,690
It test specialist. That means that that is just a specialist and not a generalizing especially when you say that I

304
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,200
immediately go

305
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,220
Team bottleneck and in in in in the year that dude screwed

306
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,580
Because he has anybody knows how to do it, right? Yeah, so

307
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,920
Yeah, a test specialization. I have several areas of test specialization

308
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,840
Because test is more than just one area helping them write better tests is one thing

309
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:29,060
Helping them think about how their components interact with others helping them helping them think helping them think

310
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm a thinking I have I'm not a thinking specialist. I'm a specialization in thinking we haven't talked about test zombies in a long time

311
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
But yeah, we're not going to yeah

312
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:46,120
Do we do we reach critical mass on that so it doesn't let me let me see if I can let me try and summarize

313
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
What I got out of this conversation

314
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,320
You can tell me where I'm wrong and then we'll try again. Okay, so there is a difference between

315
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,580
Generalizing specials and a specialized in general and it comes in the second half of that word a specialized in general

316
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,220
It's more of a general to specializes and vice versa for the other one

317
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,520
But eventually as these people one attribute they share they share multiple attributes one they share. It's important is this

318
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,350
They're grasping new knowledge and bringing it into their tool back. Yes, and then eventually as the specializing

319
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,380
generalist

320
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,560
Gets more specializations or deeper specializations and it's a generalizing specialist

321
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:35,240
Gets more broad they kind of converge on being the same person the same type. Yeah. Yeah. Well, obviously, yeah

322
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Yeah, and science fiction here

323
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,480
They the the same balance and

324
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,280
It'd be interesting to discover where that converges anything and and the path to get this Scott antlers

325
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
right the path that gets you there is

326
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
is kind of what

327
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,640
Makes you one of the other for example if I were to

328
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,120
I have a couple areas I go deep in but

329
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,630
Let's in anyway without rambling about how I become one of the other

330
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,890
Because I don't care as long as I'm valuable to the team or if they don't fire me

331
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,490
Can I also extrapolate beyond there that?

332
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,770
That's the kind and this has been written 150 times in different articles

333
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:20,570
I think I'm safe saying this that a good engineering team a whole engineering team an agile team a combined engineering team a discipline free

334
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,010
engineering team is made up of

335
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,490
those types of people

336
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:31,130
Primarily how much room is there for the dev specialist on the team of the future?

337
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,900
the programming specialist

338
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,850
Don't they need some generalization to remain relevant guy?

339
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:44,650
I think I think that when you say that I'm like, okay, what would be the the dev specialist?

340
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,840
and

341
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,320
My initial gut is that's that's what we call the architect. No, I think the architect is the generalist

342
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,160
The good architects I've known are actually some of the best test minds I've dealt with in development

343
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,500
They get how the pieces fit together they know how to think about it they know they know

344
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,740
Well, no so questions to ask it's interesting. Maybe you've had shitty architects

345
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,280
This is why I think you brought up the the losted conversation

346
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,620
because what I think of a good architect is that they are a

347
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,420
specialist in in

348
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,260
Architecture which is sort of an abstract concept right almost a general concept

349
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:39,830
Just messing with you, right? Yeah, I think I think architecture is a deep

350
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,820
It's a deep

351
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,860
Concept but it's at the high level

352
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,080
Right it it whereas you brought it up. Yeah

353
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,320
The

354
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,700
So a a dev specialist from going back to your question a dev specialist from your concept is

355
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
What then someone who knows?

356
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:13,010
The database in and out not to pick on our company which I'm gonna do in the next segment as well

357
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,890
But we have a lot of developers who are good at only

358
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,230
Tell me what to code. I'll code it and then I'll check it in. So what is that?

359
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:32,680
That's is that a coding specialist? That's I guess C sharp specialist. I don't know. Yeah, it's a language specialist. I'll implement that

360
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,300
Yeah, but then from a coding standpoint

361
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,590
If they're a C sharp specialist, are they a coding general? No, I guess so

362
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,110
I guess so because I think are we are we now like

363
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,830
Are we now?

364
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:56,470
The question coming to the opinion that it doesn't matter and everybody's the same. Let me rewind. Oh god

365
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:03,110
I don't know why I invite you only because your B is in the yeah, you I can help you find another

366
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,110
The question was oh god

367
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,760
All right, the question was Brent

368
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,440
Yes, Alan the question was is let me ask it differently so I can try and reel you the heck in

369
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Good luck with that. I know

370
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,290
Go for it. I'm ready describe

371
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,850
Take a team of 20 people. You have a 20 person engineering team

372
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,240
Are they specialists generalists generalizing special specializing generalists? What's your mix generally at the start or at the end?

373
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,300
God no, cuz we just got through talking about they're just hired. Okay, you hired a team

374
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,780
You have a brand new product. You're gonna build a fizz banger which fizzes bangs or bangs physics

375
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
I'm gonna have I'm likely

376
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,420
in today's world, I'm likely to have a team of generalists and specialists and

377
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,800
I will need to kickstart the process

378
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,720
that creates the learning loop that gets them rolling to a

379
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:07,340
Converge center so you're gonna start with generalists and specialists and that and let them turn into specializing generalist and generalizing specialists

380
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:15,380
Yeah, then become whatever the hell we haven't needed. I'm already a specializing general so you won't hire me because I'm not like a

381
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,910
One of the other in that case. No, what do you hire me as a generalist?

382
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:26,200
I would hire you but in the class you wouldn't hire me, but you know it theoretically

383
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:33,060
I would so hire you I would I would love for the first three months the the one-on-ones I

384
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,700
Don't do one-on-ones. Oh you would no

385
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Sorry, I'm busy

386
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Making your product work. Yeah

387
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,990
All right. My ideal world would be to start with

388
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:56,950
Again specializing generalist people because I would want to optimize for adaptability, but the specializations I would try to

389
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:07,470
Diversify so that there is a lot of opportunity for knowledge sharing to run amongst the team and their specializations are aligned with

390
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,510
What my product needs? All right. Okay, I'm gonna put a

391
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,150
Nice bed out with a blanket and a pillow and put this topic into the bed and tuck it in for a nice rest

392
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,780
What do you think? That's up to you. I'm not done with this. You're not done. Nope. Oh god. Okay

393
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,760
Just to let people know I got an earthquake get out of bed

394
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,000
Know what's happening with the no no yeses in the SG's so just to share

395
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:41,880
So I tweeted on this that I believe I have a mechanism. I think we I think we've hypothesized what will happen

396
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,320
For those I think we talked about that I've gone back to school and I just completed a class on

397
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,440
Modeling and simulation so I'm gonna model and simulate this and see what actually happens

398
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,130
I

399
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,010
that may be my

400
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,010
Play toy exercise for the next

401
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,290
Couple of weeks. No one wants to know about your play toy exercises. I

402
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,020
Do you think to get this? I do think we've converged on

403
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,920
Something we've already converged on like it it really doesn't matter if it's

404
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,180
SG's or GS's when you begin what's critical is this this learning?

405
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:35,340
Adaptability loop and over time we I think we both believe that they're gonna come to some happy center and

406
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,480
What is that happy center? We don't know

407
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:48,060
Correct. We don't know when I'm done with this. I'll know. All right now now can I put it to bed?

408
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:53,020
You may it's in bed. Okay. All right one more topic. No mailbag this week. Sorry no

409
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,340
Cuz it's not happening because nobody asked me questions that I recall

410
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:08,420
But I was thinking just the other day. Did you ever read microsurf the Doug Copeland book? Yeah long long long time ago

411
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,820
I remember liking I was

412
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Before I started at Microsoft. I

413
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,460
Like one chapter of it was in Wired magazine

414
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,300
I thought this is pretty cool and then I started at Microsoft and I got the book and read it

415
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,660
There was a lot of it was interesting. There was a lot of

416
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,720
Microsoft II, you know little quirks about Microsoft. This is written in, you know, pre Windows 95 pre calm it had a lot of

417
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:37,620
Sort of inside information funny things about Microsoft ease and and and it was a different

418
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,060
Microsoft it was a lot different and that book came out right when I started and

419
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,460
We talked last time Brett and I are both approaching the 20 year mark and Brent's bizarre internship story

420
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,180
Listen to the last podcast for that the previous one

421
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,340
But I was thinking and I don't know if you have many of these but I've

422
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,310
There are things

423
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:02,670
People do at Microsoft that I kind of want to feed to Doug Copeland see if I start like a follow-up

424
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,070
but for now, I'll just feed them to the

425
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,480
They're not enough of them yet for a book for sure

426
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,740
But let me fun to discuss maybe we'll make a segment out of this we're gonna think talk about things Microsoft ease do

427
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,330
What would be the title of this book? I don't know. I don't know. I haven't thought that far ahead yet

428
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:25,350
I don't think any of this anything regarding the topics of this podcast do not get thought of in advance

429
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:32,790
So don't ask me like things like that. All right, so what's your what you have me? Do you want to mind? What's your nuggets?

430
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:39,590
There's an interesting phenomenon. I see at Microsoft more than anywhere else and people will

431
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:46,290
To exit the bathroom. They'll basically wrap their entire arm and paper towels to pull the door open

432
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:54,030
Yet they'll eat anything you put on the kitchen counter. I don't get it. I

433
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,340
could put turd cookies out there

434
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
I could put like

435
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,880
Lasagna directly on the counter on a plate. They all is on ya. Yeah

436
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,100
But they cannot touch that stainless steel door handle this this

437
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,170
So Alan Alan wrote up the topic

438
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:22,350
And I'm like, okay usually when Alan wrote safe topics, I'm like, all right, I'll be able to swing with this

439
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,830
Yeah, I was like, okay

440
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:32,150
So you have you found some weird OCD specialists that you're hanging out with check it out. So Microsoft employees

441
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:38,570
What do we pay I don't think it's like a 59 total compensation like a fiction. I was like an entry-level person

442
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,050
They get good amount of money and they get great benefits

443
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:48,350
We take care of people here and we have a lot of long and tooth people like me and Brent not poor

444
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:54,910
We're not zillionaires or we wouldn't hey hey podcast Brent maybe poor. Yeah, it depends on it's a relative discussion

445
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,530
Well, anyway

446
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:04,210
You can get like an email from an admin saying hey, we're giving away free $5 t-shirts over here

447
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:11,310
Everyone will stop working like autumn deadline smedline. I'm getting my free shirt. Yes

448
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,280
and it doesn't be a shirt it can be a you know can be a shot glass or a mug or a

449
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:26,120
Little card that lets you have a badge for your avatar or whatever that the little teeny things people will I know I have a deadline

450
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,080
No, this build broken and I'm responsible to fix it. But there's a free t-shirt two buildings over. I'm going to get it

451
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,400
You ever read free? No

452
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,920
So one of the the topics that I'm hugely fascinated by is this thing called behavioral economics

453
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,320
and

454
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:51,390
The word free is just powerful right? Hey free stuff it it it doesn't even matter

455
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,390
I don't think this is a Microsoft phenomenon

456
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,550
Perhaps not yeah people we have free coffee and free soda people just grab when they go by it

457
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,790
Oh my god, the soda is free

458
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:05,750
If we're gonna say like if you like sodas free only on Fridays people would stockpile they go crazy if they changed it

459
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:13,330
Hey new t-shirt one nickel. Oh, yeah, I guarantee you would see a totally different behavior

460
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:22,210
So I was noticing that there was a a division wide t-shirt giveaway and I'm walking

461
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,470
I'm watching the throng and you know, I'm the ever the efficiency

462
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,650
And and wait, I hate waste and I'm watching

463
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,290
Thousands of people walk over to get their t-shirt and I thought you know

464
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,550
We have work to do and they're waiting in line

465
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:45,110
I know there's so when you said the microsurfs and so do the differences between the the

466
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,880
How called the decades like we are?

467
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,100
Definitely knee-deep in a new transformation

468
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,250
Right. I

469
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:03,690
Haven't I I can talk about the first decade. I was here in the second decade. I was here and very distinctly

470
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,650
I'm not gonna do it today, but the next decade

471
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,380
It's going to be very different like the one thing I found out yesterday

472
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,660
I didn't know about this and I'm still thinking through what are the downstream consequences?

473
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,110
Apparently we've stopped the ship it program. Yeah, we have. Yeah, right and I'm like

474
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,260
Interesting. So we're moving towards stopping the ship it program where we were

475
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,320
Microsoft as a whole was moving away from sort of a

476
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,020
Office space lifestyle more towards an open space lifestyle

477
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,150
And it's really for me hard to predict what this is going to be at the

478
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,790
end of that particular

479
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:53,590
Journey. Well the ship it program for those that don't work at the evil Empire is every time you ship a product you get a little

480
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,730
Decal to go on this that little metal decal to go on this plaque. Yeah

481
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,010
Yep, and I have two of them full of products that some I'm proud of and some I'm not

482
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,660
in

483
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,250
the

484
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,270
We're moving to a world where we may not have

485
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:14,490
Any products at Microsoft have major releases anymore. Maybe all incremental

486
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:19,270
Yeah, and then from that from that point of view, I totally agree with the removal the ship it program

487
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,550
But one of the things that I've used that ship it program when I go and I meet a new person

488
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,550
That's one of the first things I go look at

489
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,190
because

490
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,630
Right there is a stalker. That's like someone's Facebook history

491
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:41,300
No, what is listed right there is a set of experiences for that individual set of products a set of knowledge

492
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,760
And I find that I'm like, oh

493
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,360
Hey

494
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,360
You and I worked on the same team. I did not realize that well on mine

495
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,360
You would see I worked on Windows millennium and you would think less of me

496
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
At this point in time that's a challenge

497
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,290
Oh

498
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,580
Hear that

499
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:13,020
Right just didn't hear he worked on it. And as we heard earlier, he's a test specialist and yet millennium still happened

500
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,610
It's a law I could talk about windows. It's me. I don't know the millennium came from I thought it was Windows marketing edition

501
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:25,010
Millennium edition. Yeah, I was that was that the fix for y2k? No

502
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,530
I'm still puzzled why that thing ever went out

503
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:34,650
You know why it went out because that was before we companies were distributing applications primarily via the internet and Windows

504
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,850
Was the only ship vehicle for a lot of applications?

505
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:42,730
So we had to put a new version of Windows out in order to ship a bunch of things that people wanted to have shipped elsewhere

506
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,430
at Microsoft. Yeah

507
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,640
Sorry world. Yep

508
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,760
We broke the world. Do I have any Alan broke the world? I haven't matched the trend yet

509
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
I'm gonna make a list of these

510
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:04,020
There is a weird vortex around campus and I can't now that we used to have parking passes we stuck in their window

511
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,340
I never put one in but you can always tell a Microsoft driver because they had the same little pass hanging from their window

512
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,720
Yeah, but now we don't require those so I can't identify the Microsoft drivers

513
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,680
but I can say there is a vortex around the campus of

514
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Really aggressive bad driving?

515
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,990
yes, but I haven't found the pattern yet to to really make that a

516
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,680
An observable trend that I can predict

517
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,080
Six years ago

518
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,920
This was like all throughout our internal like news sources that it was a huge problem

519
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,520
And I haven't seen any sort of um, I I

520
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,080
People ignoring pedestrians and oh they do completely I yeah sometimes if I get up late

521
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,480
I will go for a run in the middle of the day rather than I usually run in the morning and

522
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,760
I take a path that has me crossing the fewest streets as possible yet. I still

523
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:03,180
Pretty much I'm in fear for my life every time I cross the street. Yeah, I just let the car go by I try to

524
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,700
But then yeah, it's it's it's a crazy

525
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:11,100
It's crazy and I think part of it is do you think that so Microsoft has these streets that go through campus?

526
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:18,060
But they're they're public streets technically I think but the police never watch them. They are public streets. So yeah people drive

527
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,000
That shit crazy. Yep, and yeah, so

528
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,520
And even around blind corners and and

529
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,030
one of the

530
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,310
One of the things that I tell people on that because I get every so often

531
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:33,910
Oh my god

532
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,910
I was just about to enter the crosswalk and this guy went anyway, and I'm like, okay

533
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:43,430
Well, you didn't enter the crosswalk. So by the legal they can still go once you step a foot in there

534
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:47,470
Yeah, they have to stop and that's the other thing the the Microsoft pedestrians

535
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,070
They don't slow down. No, they

536
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:56,740
It's idiotic the approach of my lights green I'm going if you hit me it's your fault. Yes, and you're going to die

537
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,660
Yeah, that's the thing that like with the pedestrian even worse

538
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,220
I have a longer story for this. I'm not gonna go into it today. But the nutshell of it is

539
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,920
Look guys

540
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,640
You walk in the crosswalk and you and you get hit

541
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,470
Yes, they are in the wrong

542
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,990
They'll go to jail

543
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,990
You'll go to the graveyard. I

544
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:26,470
Just don't get your perspective, right? I was on a run one morning at work and

545
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,870
a guy was on his bicycle on the

546
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,860
On the sidewalk and he wanted to there's this turn

547
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,900
There's this place for people coming off the freeway and they want to turn right and it's really hard visibility

548
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,340
They want to turn right on the red

549
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:44,920
But they can't because they can't see there was a guy on his bicycle and he was like one foot in the street

550
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,300
Ready to go the second that crosswalk turned green

551
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,260
Pedestrian sign turns green the same time the traffic light turns green the guy

552
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,480
Started turn right slammed on his brakes

553
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,480
He wasn't going very fast and the bicyclist because he wanted to make a point just stood in front of him

554
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,680
He stared at him and stood right in front of his car. Just I mean like an aggressive bicyclist and I

555
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,080
Don't get it. Anyway off of the weeds here a little bit

556
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,680
But we'll look for I'll look for some more and it isn't just like one isolated thing. I'm looking for some more trends

557
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,100
There's a new pattern going like one of the things

558
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,440
Like the open the open space model

559
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:30,760
Here in Xbox, I think it's done rather effectively. I'm moving to to a new

560
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,520
building where it with a different design it's sort of the

561
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:44,360
The the corral people in like cows about to get milked a model that you'll see you that the Skype team has

562
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,760
Oh, I hate that but but the thing is that we've been told is that it's all open space and it's collaborative

563
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,240
but you go walk in those buildings and it's like

564
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,240
Entering a library during the middle of a funeral. I love team rooms. I love them

565
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,200
When they max out at 10 people at the most

566
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,980
Yeah, when you shove in 30 it it turns into a library I was yeah a whole other conversation

567
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,780
But there's there's a there will be

568
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,920
Pattern consequences to that model. All right. We'll look for things to happen in the next decade. Yes, we will stay employed that long

569
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:30,420
All right, everyone have a happy happy and safe holiday and a fantastic new year. All right, I'm not Brent. I am not Alan

570
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,420
All right, we'll see you in 2015

571
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
Ciao
