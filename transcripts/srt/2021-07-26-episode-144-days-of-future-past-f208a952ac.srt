00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,260
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,580
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show welcome to dance party you

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,020
know it's the AB testing podcast hey everyone I'm Alan I'm Brent and this is

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:33,200
144 yes episode 144 not just a random number which is a perfect score of 12

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,220
by the way I tend to prefer our prime number podcasts when's the next one I

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:52,380
don't know what no 20 no 147 49 might be how's it how's the the new gig well it's

8
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,940
the same gig with the new boss and my org is growing I have yeah there's a

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,020
unannounced reargue coming so I won't give the details on that but that'll put my

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,480
org at about including open headcount about 130 140 somewhere in there Wow so

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,940
my dog is joining the podcast everyone say hi to Tara Tara say hello hi Tara

12
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,740
she can't hear you you're in there my headphones but it should make her

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,460
wookiee sound here in a second it's going pretty well I like it works fun

14
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,180
it's just an easy place to do good work as I've said many times so yeah

15
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,980
work is good how are things going on your end work is work where we're in a phase

16
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:45,860
where I don't know so right now there's a high urgency thing asked from the

17
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,170
senior VP and it results in me spending a lot of my time building yet another

18
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:01,250
dashboard and as you know that type of work really excites me yep yeah yeah yeah

19
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,530
yeah I am I tried I play the hands when somebody's told me to build a dashboard

20
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,100
I play the hands over my ears la la la la can't hear you game that works well

21
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,260
for me I'm not sure what happens you know well for you yeah no so in this

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,410
particular case I actually so the last time I said yes to this ask it was a

23
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,970
big massive learning lesson I told my manager no I am NOT doing this again and

24
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,840
this time around I had I had my staff come in and have them work on it but one

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,160
of my peers is going on paternity leave and one of the things that I do pride

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:54,620
myself on is I am good at training up people to be on the bench and so the

27
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,900
person that I had targeted to to basically be the leader for this project

28
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:08,660
that is not me was also on the bench and so she is now going to be while he's

29
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,460
out on paternity she is going to be the acting manager of that team which I

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,100
think is a fantastic opportunity and experience for her but it now puts me in

31
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:27,450
the position of oh I have to be the IC for the stupid dashboard so you bring up

32
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,130
one thing I was gonna push us along to the topic but this idea as a leader in

33
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,190
building a bench and it's a term that's not every company uses it but I've heard

34
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,390
it enough to know it's used pretty often it's this who is the level of

35
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,310
leadership that is gonna take over for you when you leave move on to something

36
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,190
else etc right and I've been working a lot on that I have a fairly junior team

37
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:57,190
where I now have with a recent promotion I have one manager within two

38
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,710
levels of me right now and working on getting everyone else where they need to

39
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,510
be with the way you have one manager in an organization of a hundred no no no

40
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,430
I have one that's within most both all of the rest of them are three levels

41
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,620
below me latter level wise one is two levels below me I am trying to grow my

42
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,420
org so right now there's no one if I disappear if I decide I want to go farm

43
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,900
clams in would be island there is no one in my org that can take over for me

44
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,580
as my org is planned to continue to grow throughout this year I have now

45
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,340
one person who can take on a lot more leadership and some that are getting

46
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,100
there but I'm spending a lot of time trying to groom my bench going back to

47
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,300
the term of the bench again to get more people on my team capable and ready to

48
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:58,930
take on larger more strategic roles yeah yeah I forgot I there was a reorg we

49
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,070
had a lot of reorgues I actually have two two of my managers are within two

50
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:10,260
levels of me but I don't I don't I'm not I put it this way I'm I do not have a

51
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,580
good bench right now it's on my mind it's something I work on with my HR

52
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,780
business partner as far as planning goes quite a bit to make sure we're moving in

53
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,980
that direction when you say in within two levels of you do you mean lateral

54
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,340
or yeah hierarchical I mean latter levels okay got it got it and and those I just

55
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,620
want to I'll keep them abstract but it's you know similar to Microsoft is a

56
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,860
level of scope and responsibility that people typically can cover as they grow

57
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,420
through latter levels and you know I could solve the problem I'll just promote

58
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,460
them but they're not already to handle the scope of that work so I'm working on

59
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:57,780
that right right that's that's one thing that I I view very seriously with with

60
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:05,150
promoting folks one cool anecdote to share I don't spend long talking about but we

61
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,910
could actually if I could change the topic we could do a whole podcast on

62
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,670
growing your team when I left Microsoft and we're gonna have a longer topic on

63
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,940
this a little bit I recall my last several years there as teams began to

64
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,900
flatten there were far fewer lead positions and there were people who had

65
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,480
been leads or wanted to be leads it was very difficult to get into a lead

66
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,170
position I don't know if that's still the case or not no it's not it's not in

67
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,680
some regards and I forget the chronology but you were you were there for both

68
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,920
events and one was right when we got when we we moved tests to different

69
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,120
disciplines and then there was another where and not all teams did this but

70
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,080
it was in general with them within Microsoft like a general flattening of

71
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,560
organizations yeah what I recall I'm just finished my thought and you go on

72
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,720
with yours but whatever call is that when that flattening happened there are a lot

73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,720
of leads who either moved to I see positions or what remember when there was

74
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,560
an opening for a lead position there would be a hundred applicants and just

75
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
the thought I was gonna say is right where I'm at now I actually have lead

76
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,440
positions that I can't get anyone to want to I was I am short a few leads

77
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,160
on my team across across the organization and I am going to have to

78
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,480
probably internal transfer or higher externally which is I hate I don't hate

79
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,480
doing for a lead it's difficult to do for a lead I think but I have to figure

80
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,320
something out because I'm short a couple leads and all of my IC's are like no man

81
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,680
I don't want to be a lead I love being an IC but go ahead and continue your

82
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,010
chronology sir about Microsoft well I was gonna say there was a time where we

83
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,450
kind of flattened the the organization as a whole within Microsoft I remember not

84
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,250
all teams did this but it was still sort of a general practice and I would

85
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:09,350
say things are sort of naturally kind of going back to the way it was like they're

86
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,150
heading back so in other words we probably over over flattened and in the

87
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,190
in the do-ness of time things have become a little bit more hierarchical as things

88
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,830
happen I don't think it's problematic at this point in time like back in the day

89
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:36,950
right a manager with two directs was super freakin common yeah it's it's it

90
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:44,230
happens it's but it's not common now back in the day someone in the senior

91
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:50,740
band might be a manager or that was super common it's not common today but it does

92
00:08:50,740 --> 00:09:02,080
happen the 20 20 years ago someone far from senior could be a lead yeah yeah

93
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,530
actually is the wild wild west all right so anyway that's interesting grow your

94
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,280
bench and find good leads and take care of them because they're good people I

95
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,120
have two topics for the day one was a cliffhanger from our last episode if you

96
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,550
want to go back and check it out you can do that but the story was I was asked

97
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:36,150
to give an AMA at test bash home if you are a Ministry of testing pro subscriber

98
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,350
you can go watch that recording right now and the wonderful Tristan asked me

99
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,920
questions about the feature of test automation I think they asked me to

100
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:55,680
give this talk knowing I would be at least somewhat controversial and I came

101
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,920
up with three bullet points that we discussed and each designed to it in

102
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,800
combination the three of them together the van was designed to piss off the

103
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:16,850
most possible people unfortunately because the audience was so mature and

104
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,530
had actual proper critical thinking it just made him think about stuff and ask

105
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,490
good questions but the idea was there so I don't know if I should give you

106
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,530
them to you one at a time or go through all three maybe I'll do one at

107
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,690
a time because knowing you you'll want to comment and off the real you back

108
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:41,920
in so the first one is I have forgotten no the first one is in the future

109
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,540
developers will do the vast majority of all test automation okay and I was

110
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,860
trying to find in looking I was trying to see if someone wrote down what these

111
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,780
were because I I just scribbled it on a piece of paper somewhere as test bash

112
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,590
was approaching but I can actually find myself saying this as far back as 2016

113
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,310
so I don't think anything super controversial or something you hadn't

114
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,990
heard before actually none of these are things you hadn't heard before so that's

115
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:17,350
number one any worries about that as a prediction like the only thing I could

116
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,910
say that would cause it to fall apart is perhaps underestimating the the

117
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:29,270
strength of test automators white knuckles holding on to the past this

118
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,550
is actually my worry because there are leagues and leagues of teams who do our

119
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,070
test automation specialists yeah and that's what they do they don't want to

120
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:47,120
do anything else they make their money making so but I think it's right I think

121
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,520
it's in and for all the reasons we talked about in modern testing on this

122
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,840
podcast it's inefficient once developers write the code write the test for the

123
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,640
code they end up writing better design code because they end up writing more

124
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,360
testable code all these things happen lots of good things happen developers

125
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,680
own test automation they end up automating a lot of the right things and

126
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:15,090
they do a good job yeah I think actually one of the one of the things that is

127
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,930
sort of what's the opposite of a prediction the one of the things that

128
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:26,690
benefiting the opposite of your prediction is that literally everyone

129
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:34,170
that I have talked to and we even when we had that conversation with those folks

130
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,960
a couple of podcasts ago right I'm forgetting their name the the company

131
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,040
name at the moment where where they're providing test automation services reflect

132
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,280
on run thank you reflect that run right one of the things that is I think

133
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:58,200
slowing this down is the fact that not a lot of people are still currently aware

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,920
around around the the current studies and science on this one no no because they

135
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,600
like to just you know we live in our bubble they live in their bubble yeah a

136
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,880
so anyway I'm not surprising you there too but you can imagine you can

137
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,160
imagine that would push some buttons the second one again is nothing you

138
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,760
picking a reflect dot run nothing you haven't heard before I think record and

139
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,240
playback low code whatever you want to call them tools like reflect dot run

140
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,920
test and Mabel etc they will be the de facto standard for test automation I

141
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,230
think in the future handcrafted tests in Selenium sorry Jason I love you but

142
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:47,000
you're not the future handcrafted tests go away and record and playback was a

143
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,880
de facto for UA automation there's still actually you will use Selenium for some

144
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,240
special cases when you want to do a special maybe it's a stress scenario

145
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,080
maybe it's a smart monkey test there are some things that it will probably do

146
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,770
better when you want to handcraft your test but this idea of armies of sorry

147
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:13,050
not armies this idea of a mass of web tests written in Selenium running as

148
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:20,120
your product is going away those two together mean that developers will be

149
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,400
using these record they know how to code which is great they also know how to be

150
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,240
efficient and I would say in the future a developer quickly creates a record and

151
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,840
playback test for the UI they've done game over that's that's the way UI

152
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,440
testing is done and the way test wait UI test automation I'm sorry is done in the

153
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:48,240
future yeah yeah and I think it's influenced once business leaders

154
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:56,470
recognize the outcomes that we're recognizing and I think they'll shift

155
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:04,570
over right it's essentially what so what holds it back number one developers don't

156
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:12,090
want to do it number two test you know small armies of test automation

157
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:20,610
engineers obviously don't want to have their job at risk right number three

158
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,410
business leaders aren't actually really aware of the benefits so if business

159
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:32,170
leader once they're aware of the benefits right whether it be dev or test they're

160
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,730
both gonna kind of both dev and test and a lot of businesses are gonna push back

161
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:44,480
on this that's that's what's gonna slow it down at least from my experience you

162
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:53,480
need to have leaders that I don't know the way I would never mind I'm all right

163
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,560
I'm blocking my own tangent so the last one can try this one a little bit

164
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,240
because I know one way to trigger a lot of people is bring up the test

165
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,120
automation pyramid because I don't know why I like to push buttons and what I

166
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,120
said was because of the first two when the when we have a world where

167
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,120
developers are doing the vast majority of automation and the UI automation is done

168
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,400
via record and playback the benefits from that actually make the test

169
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,040
automation distribution just test automation pyramid true in nearly every

170
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:37,560
case wait wait wait so that's automation pyramid because of one and two test

171
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,070
automation pyramid becomes true yes where I think a lot of people this was back to

172
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,550
my comment I've said many times where people look at the test automation

173
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:53,150
pyramid and they think it's dumb to try and make their tests fit that ratio and

174
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,990
they're right and my viewpoint has always been that the test automation

175
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,350
pyramid is a reflection of what happens when you have well-designed code and I

176
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,350
think you'll get more of that as developers own more stuff and have an

177
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,790
easy way to do their UA automation you're gonna you're gonna see the

178
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:15,200
pyramid actually happen and nobody will care and this is the problem right now

179
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,360
people care too much about the pyramid no but it's not always right and

180
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,870
sometimes you want the ice cream cone and sometimes shut up stop your warning

181
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,510
it's a model all models are wrong some are useful everything about it makes

182
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:36,390
sense just stop getting your arms all caught up there slim buckety so let me

183
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:43,020
first thing when we're talking about when we're talking about the test

184
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,500
automation pyramid correct we're talking about one where there's edb

185
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,620
number of tests at the UI layer there's you know right more at the business layer

186
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,300
and then way way way way more of the unit test layer right that's what we're

187
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:06,280
talking about right so if Dev owns everything and record and playback is

188
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:16,000
done through the UI you then think unit tests will become dominant and the UI

189
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,760
will be I think you're overthinking this Brent and no no I'm trying to decide if

190
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,920
I agree with your thing and what I'm you're right I may be overthinking but

191
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,960
obviously what we see so if if record and playback becomes wildly successful

192
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,520
because of well let me phrase it differently I think those who argue with

193
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,400
the test automation pyramid most of the stem of their arguments come from the

194
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,120
fact that test rather than dev attempts to own the vast majority of test

195
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,840
automation I think if and when developers own automation regardless of

196
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,320
the children regardless of a second one when developers own automation it is much

197
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,080
more apt and I would say almost guaranteed that the tests fall into a

198
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,400
distribution as described by the test pyramid yeah I'm just wondering to what

199
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:19,580
degree the service layer like I actually wonder in your thing if you know

200
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,990
the quote-unquote middle class disappears because it's really the thing there's

201
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:31,840
there's not if the pyramid puts those nice lines between things it's test get

202
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,680
more granular less granular depending on where you're going there's a fuzzy line

203
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,120
between things you call unit tests and things you call functional tests and even

204
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,320
things you call UI tests or end-to-end tests yeah the the only issue is is that

205
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,890
I actually see you know UI tests you know taking over if it ends up being that

206
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:04,370
easy and you know fixing shit through through ML supported methods right ends up

207
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:12,320
being that easy then I could easily see the the business rule automation sort of

208
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:19,000
disappearing unit tests thing because of how fast it is and things along those

209
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,800
lines I kind of I feel like I agree with you that that would be at the bottom but

210
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,720
I'm wondering if the pyramid becomes a square I don't think so I think and

211
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,640
I'll say this again for those who have heard me say this I think today due to

212
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,480
ownership and the popularity and nothing again love you Jason nothing against

213
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:49,600
Selenium I think the industry has an unhealthy infatuation with UI automation

214
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:59,030
and I think the in the future that goes away explain that in the context of

215
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:07,760
your principle number two today with test owning writing the UI automation and

216
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,040
loving loving loving Selenium and having it being a separate team often not even

217
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,120
connected or talking with the dev team agree right thousands and hundreds of

218
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:25,480
thousands of lines of Selenium code to execute the UI of their application it

219
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,480
takes a long time those tests are can be flaky when selectors changes lots of

220
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
stuff you can do around that to make those more resilient but still they are

221
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,840
flaky and it takes a lot of time to build and maintain those tests I'm saying

222
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,520
in the future it's going to be much more efficient to just record and

223
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,280
playback that test and if the test ever can't handle those tests again

224
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,400
with the right tools those record and playback tests will automatically adapt

225
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,080
to changes in your underlying selectors layout etc if it ever gets to a point

226
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,160
where your test just the tool can't keep up with the overall you made to your

227
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,680
website I think it's still faster just to go rerecord that test than it

228
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,760
would ever have been to continue to handcraft and maintain those tests over

229
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,520
time I now understand where we we where you and I where I was having

230
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,200
difficulty getting to the same page in your book and it was essentially because

231
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,520
you talk about UI automation and in all of that discussion that synonymous with

232
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,560
with handcrafted UI automation right to me recording playback is still UI

233
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,720
automation it is I did not mean to imply otherwise right but the value proposition

234
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,200
of having a whole team whose job it is to spend 50% of their time taking

235
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,920
yesterday's flaky tests and turning them into tomorrow's different flaky tests

236
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:02,640
right that shit goes away I think that the tools today are very resilient to

237
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,240
change in underlying code and that's what's been missing and again we came

238
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,600
from a world you and I hear record and playback we automatically think nope way

239
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,320
too flaky for use the world's changed in the web world at least stuff got

240
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,560
better anyway that's it I do want to get to the other topic today which I think

241
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,400
is gonna require some discussion so that's sort of a recap I encourage you

242
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,600
who are pro members to go to the ministry testing site and check out that

243
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,200
talk it's very I had a good time lots of good feedback and I'm surprised given

244
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
the at my attempt at controversy which kind of failed that it was still fun I

245
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,800
at least got some people to think which is always what we strive for and

246
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,120
maybe testing and so I try and take that stuff elsewhere so did you get any push

247
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:55,120
back on not really not really there are some tangential questions around well

248
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,480
should testers still learn to code and of course I think yes and I think it's a

249
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,160
lot of things that could do that aren't writing test automation there's

250
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,760
lots of tooling and even doing some testing that isn't necessarily driving

251
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,280
the UI but no real pushback no real pushback people there's stuff like

252
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,120
people didn't really believe me like oh yeah I could see why you think that but

253
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,220
that won't work in my world a lot of the snowflake stuff you overtime what

254
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,420
happens I could be wrong but it's a world where I think it's a better world the

255
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,460
future I described is it is it is achievable it's what Steven Johnson

256
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,660
calls the adjacent possible it's right there we just need teams to start

257
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,660
doing it and I have found I also discovered not just teams I've worked

258
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,300
with here at Unity but I have now found other team for the development

259
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,500
teams are more and more like when we first talked about modern testing team say oh

260
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,940
hey we're doing that I am finding development teams who are using record

261
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,660
and playback tools for the UI automation so it's it's happening just not

262
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:57,020
widespread yet I think it's gonna be big we had a subject change not really a

263
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,260
mailbag question but a good inquisitive question on the slack

264
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,820
channel today it's something I've been asked before and worth talking about if

265
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,420
you can recall way back remember the you don't remember it but the listeners

266
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:15,420
are three listeners may remember we did a podcast once without Brent I invited I

267
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:21,980
invited all three to join me in this small room kind of off behind the seats

268
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,900
in the room where we had a test bash Philly in 2016 I was at Microsoft

269
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:33,580
working on Microsoft Teams and I gave a talk on testing without testers sort of

270
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:41,020
the beginning of how I have been working with teams to on quality coaching we

271
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,820
took we have previous podcast or talked about that will rehash a little bit of

272
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,940
that but they asked a very good question they say Alan I'm gonna I'm gonna for

273
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,260
Raghu on it's like I'm gonna summarize this whole thing to something I've heard

274
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,880
before so you're pretty passionate about modern testing and not having dedicated

275
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,680
testers and test coaching and you worked on teams but with all that said

276
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,760
you worked on teams Microsoft Teams and Brett don't say anything you'd stop in

277
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:16,120
trouble but they say but Microsoft Teams really really sucks so what happened is

278
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,840
it did you really are you are you not walking the talk or whatever again I'll

279
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,920
do most of talking to your Brett in case you know your boss is ever listening I

280
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,440
like like honestly I can't imagine Microsoft you can't badmouth our

281
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,480
product every single Microsoft product is excellent and you need to tout our

282
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:46,780
awesomeness no so there will be no teams bashing for me today I I do think it has

283
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:53,890
I mean it has it has wads but generally generally a lot of those wads can be

284
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:59,650
traced that sometimes can be traced back to two things that I have a very

285
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:05,330
particular interest there will be none of that today but as it relates to what

286
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:11,450
the hell Alan you you hypocrite I'm all aboard on that conversation okay so let

287
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,770
me talk let me just rehash a little bit those haven't been on the podcast for a

288
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,810
long time we talked about it when I was there on the podcast I don't

289
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,090
remember numbers back in the 60s or 70s it's been a while not episode

290
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:28,290
numbers not years so I joined teams as an individual contributor to they were

291
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,410
very early on they were about 75 developers maybe all up at the time maybe

292
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:39,840
less maybe 50 I can't quite remember but they wanted someone to come in and

293
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,040
help the team think more about quality they did not having dedicated testers they

294
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,740
had some former testers working on infrastructure here and there but they

295
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,580
didn't really have anyone helping the team think about testing I joined the

296
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:58,000
team and they had a pretty good suite of unit tests in place and some other tests

297
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,390
which weren't very good they did as I've described elsewhere all the testing they

298
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,150
knew how to do and they put some effort into it it wasn't great but it

299
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:13,140
wasn't horrible so that's where I started and I joined the team and I did

300
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:20,280
some stuff kind of like a test manager would for the team I just I made sure

301
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,880
bug tracking was in place and we had some bug metrics boring but worth

302
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,080
tracking for tech debt I did some communication around quality and just kind

303
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,680
of set the team up a little bit with the quality culture maybe some of my first

304
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,320
thinking that in develop the quality culture guide till a couple years later

305
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,760
but at least stuff that was in my head way more years later yeah so one

306
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,440
thing I realized there so I did a couple times I did a bug bash kind of

307
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,720
thing let's take two hours today or a half a day today and we'll all do a bunch

308
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,490
of testing on the project and I would they mostly did it in teams like small

309
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,890
little teams getting together to work on things and I would roam fairly small

310
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,570
team and give them ideas and help them and I of course I have been coaching

311
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,410
them and giving them ideas on quality little tidbits here and there before

312
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,010
then and this was the first time I discovered that given the freedom and

313
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:19,690
permission to do so developers can do very excellent testing not checking God

314
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:26,370
okay I'm gonna avoid that very deep good test they dug in they found bugs that

315
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,130
only the very some of them some of them just found very surface level things but

316
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:37,490
a good number of them found bugs that only the best testers I know may have

317
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:43,630
found very deep important bugs and they just they looked at how the system fit

318
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,710
together and found some flaws that were worth fixing definitely your P0 type

319
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,110
bugs so that was a revelation like yes they actually can do great testing

320
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,030
wasn't really revelation I expected it would happen but it sort of provided

321
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:03,590
some proof so in the early days we were trying to get we're trying to get

322
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,990
product market fit trying to prove viability trying to figure out if we're

323
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,550
making something that could be sold and as typical for many projects at Microsoft

324
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,630
there were several teams at the time originally working on similar things

325
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,850
they wanted something that was sort of compete in that slack space and over

326
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,120
time they we built in the the conferencing stuff too but we we kind of

327
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,760
won out along the Microsoft teams among the Microsoft organizations building

328
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,960
communication and collaboration type tools so at that stage all pretty good

329
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,760
we're still pretty small trying to find the right product we did and it was

330
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,800
working I over time I took over to have the most influence over quality I took

331
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,960
over running all of our infrastructure teams as well as kind of putting on a

332
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,400
release manager hat for our beta and I left right after the beta to just have

333
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,760
as much control as I could as I could over what we were releasing quality

334
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,120
understanding understanding where risk was also in the modern testing world

335
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,240
helping the team get to a stage where they could comfortably release every

336
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,200
week and not worry about it's for the we actually release all the back-end

337
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,600
services all the time but the front end once a week and getting a team used

338
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,520
to that that was hard believe it or not because they were so used to your

339
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,640
typical waterfall ship every year projects a lot of these folks that they

340
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,400
would even for a once a week release they try and shove stuff in at the end

341
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:45,280
they say look the next trains coming by and I at the time when I was there I

342
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,360
really wanted to get them to continuous delivery on the front end right but we

343
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,880
just didn't have they didn't have the quality cultures to do it talk about

344
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,520
why in a minute I wanted to get there I ended up hiring a team in India to help

345
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:07,500
with testing because the develop I'll get to the crux of this the developers

346
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,720
were too busy doing other stuff to get to to get to doing the testing that it

347
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,520
needed to do and what it came down to was really the culture of the team

348
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,600
which is eventually why I left Microsoft Teams was I can say in my 22 years

349
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,680
at Microsoft hands down the most toxic culture I ever worked in there was

350
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,560
nothing about the customer it was all about pleasing your boss and pleasing

351
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,320
their boss I had never worked with such a huge group of suck-ups in my life

352
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,230
you know I said earlier I said it a million times you know unity it's easy to

353
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,350
do good work because the egos don't get in the way best ideas win the things

354
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:56,150
you want to see but at teams it was so hard to do good work because if you

355
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,210
did the right thing for the customer doesn't matter if you didn't matter if

356
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:09,490
it's a huge win for the customer if it wasn't done in a way that sufficiently

357
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:15,770
sucked up to your manager or to their manager it was gaffod so we had a

358
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,850
program manager which is a Microsoft or like a product manager in the rest of the

359
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,890
world who was I remember the time I remember the time I knew the end was

360
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:30,450
near I was in a we used to call a war room meetings and then became something

361
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:37,710
else a ship room a ship room meeting and we had just put the the Alpha out or the

362
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,070
first beta some early release before the beta maybe it was the beta that went out

363
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:48,700
I can't remember what the order was and he had went and you know got feedback

364
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,650
from some other teams at Microsoft and some customers and came up with a list

365
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,090
of things that had to be fixed in fact I didn't know if it was customer-based I

366
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:03,170
think it was made money been from our VP but he's like ten things we gotta do and

367
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:08,060
we have to do these and we have to do them by this date and he went he got up

368
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,300
a little bit of a soapbox and said every priority is getting these things

369
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,060
done in time for in time for this whatever this date was we'll take

370
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,940
shortcuts where we need to we have to have these done and I chimed it said

371
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,580
yeah but we can't sacrifice quality we have a good quality release we can't

372
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,520
sacrifice it he got mad he is like yeah he says quality is one of the shortcuts

373
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,400
we'll take to get these done and at that point I knew I was in a losing battle

374
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,080
because he was fairly new to the org but he had joined the org because he was a

375
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,480
previous suck up of our VP and he had our VP's ear and once he knew that I

376
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
was against getting these features done over the favor of quality it was

377
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,640
basically impossible for me to get my job done so combination of that my boss

378
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,120
calling me at home to ask why I approved something for release just all kinds of

379
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,840
micromanaging and toxicity kind of caused me to leave but I think those things

380
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,240
this prioritization of features over quality this inability or unwillingness

381
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,400
to understand the value that CD brings to quality after I left they went to a

382
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,490
point where their changes and bugs were so jarring in their big weekly releases

383
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,770
that it's like my reaction be okay we just ship you know continuous delivery

384
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:33,290
ship our often puts FBI and feature flight theater right their immediate

385
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:38,080
reaction was to go ship that front end monthly instead of weekly and I have

386
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,480
told you a thousand times I'm sure you agree I would rather ship a hundred

387
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,240
times a day than once a month and I and I believe those things led to gaps

388
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:56,620
in quality I could say I can say that from a data perspective as advances as

389
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,840
you would expect any Microsoft team to be we could debug we knew exactly where

390
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,880
customers were getting failures and what was going on there the problem was there

391
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,000
were so many failures that we had a hard time prioritizing them sometimes it

392
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,480
wasn't it wasn't tractable because it was so frequent that's more into why I

393
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,760
left than the quality issues but I'm going from what I heard from immediately

394
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,440
after I left I talked to some people for a little while in fact I hired one of

395
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,800
my previous managers to take over my job when I left and he's much more of the

396
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,880
traditional test manager which I thought would be good for that org but

397
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,480
maybe it wasn't because he was all too happy to drop back to shipping once a

398
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,760
month and doing a full test pass with the even an even bigger team of

399
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,760
offshore testers in India and I think a lot of those things just trying there

400
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,920
was still trying when I left or at least in that first six months after I left

401
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,720
they were still trying to test quality in via outsource team and I just don't

402
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,440
think that's a good recipe for long-term quality success so that's where

403
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,120
I think happened there but I didn't even make fun of team as much as I want

404
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,040
except for the fact that I can tell you that it at least they have a

405
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,520
Linux client now which I have installed and uninstalled occasionally what I have

406
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:21,040
to do a Teams meeting but honestly zoom and slack I have to say whether I worked

407
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,820
on teams before or not I love so much more I would say teams is to its credit

408
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:37,800
teams being part of office 365 is genius because it's the collaboration app for

409
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,120
companies that don't know the need a collaboration app nobody's switching

410
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,800
from slack to teams released willingly but teams that don't use a collaboration

411
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,010
app they can they'll use teams and it's it's kind of okay it's not great there

412
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,690
are some bugs and not to say zoom doesn't have bugs and slack doesn't have

413
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,930
bugs these things all have bugs and I'm not gonna go list them all out and see

414
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,650
which one is buggier but for me the zoom slack combination has been pretty

415
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:08,570
awesome so anyway that that's the story of why I think quality remember do you

416
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,770
work with Ronnie Calabi yeah so he has that term he came up with the term he

417
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,570
coined the term the hippo the highest paid person's opinion and you want to

418
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,850
avoid that and be data-driven this team very much and they have a new VP in

419
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:25,050
place since I since in the last year or so but teams was very much at the

420
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:31,890
every feature every decision was at the whim of the VP running the org I

421
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,200
think that's what led to the quality where it was the story I think you just

422
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,640
told I mean it happened there were there were some things that I'm not

423
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,520
gonna talk about on the podcast that I think were unique to your situation

424
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,560
but in general I think 80 to 90 percent of your situation was essentially a team

425
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,360
and transformation right it's essentially you had you had a lot of old

426
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:09,040
schoolers in the business leadership folks that would say hey I've been shipping

427
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,480
product for 20 years I know how to do it blah blah blah yeah at the same time you

428
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:23,680
had those folks building a what is essentially a service and not really

429
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:31,720
adapting well and what happened in this particular case I think your story is is

430
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:43,180
one around how agile transformations can go wrong right so I have talked about it

431
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,620
on the podcast as well you and I had different experiences and being the in

432
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:56,720
the Xbox right my experience on the Xbox org I will I'll just quite honestly say

433
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:04,880
very very aligned with the story you just told right they were not an agile

434
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,640
team they were a fragile team and they and it was during that period of time in

435
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,440
Microsoft where they were where again agile principles were being weaponized

436
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,560
instead of being used for the the benefit of the customer and there weren't

437
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,280
a whole lot of people that really understood how to do it even me at that

438
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,960
point in time like I left Xbox to to go to Bing at that point in time because

439
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,440
they were a service and I went to Bing to learn how to do this right and I did

440
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,120
and I don't know too much about the internal structure I have a few contacts

441
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:51,240
in teams I don't talk to them all that often but to me I think actually the

442
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,120
story to tell there right the difference between zoom and in slack in teams might

443
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:04,680
very well be I'll frame it as a hypothesis my very well be you know how

444
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,960
long it took teams to to realize that they needed to shift to it to some form

445
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,120
a CICD model yeah I don't know if they're there yet I don't I I would hope

446
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,560
so but I don't know it doesn't matter I have some evidence that they might be but

447
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,530
I can't say one way or the other I don't actually know but this is teams is where I

448
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,090
learned how to do safe deployments I'm we would do originally I got there we

449
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:38,160
had a both a dev environment and a test environment and the regular environment

450
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,600
the typical environments you have and the dev environment was always crappy and

451
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,720
I remember this is funny it's reminding me I remember that nobody on team is

452
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,400
before we ship but nobody used the prod everyone used dev go after use dev

453
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,680
loading get the new features but oh god this is bad but eventually we had one

454
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,240
environment with with ring deployment so we when we did our weekly release we

455
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,600
always like released on Friday but we did the snapshot on Monday and that

456
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:15,740
snapshot on Monday immediately went to prod but that version was only available

457
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:21,420
for first my team and then we roll it out to usually if it passed initial

458
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,360
sort of smoke testing would go to all of the Microsoft Teams team and then to

459
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,620
all of Microsoft and then eventually on Friday release it to customers which

460
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,440
was you know my first experience doing that kind of staged rollout which was

461
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,440
really powerful way to do that and that was fun and I loved it but hopefully

462
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,120
that got even faster but I totally forgot that yeah and I went back and

463
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:49,840
looked back in time the one thing I'll say is to the best of my knowledge teams

464
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:58,440
was the first time where you were taking a very direct hand in trying to

465
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:05,260
ship the waterfall team to to an agile team it was worse it was a it was a

466
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:12,310
edge it was a waterfall team who thought they were agile right yeah it yeah go

467
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:18,030
back to that's exactly my experience the back box and and for the listeners like

468
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:24,070
I left before Alan joined and any overlap at all there I don't think so

469
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:28,820
when did you do you remember when you left it linked in would show it I'm not

470
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,500
gonna go look at LinkedIn so I remember I joined Xbox on Halloween in 2013 yeah I

471
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,100
was in being so I think there was a gap of months there so no no overlap because

472
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:47,460
I I joined being in pretty certain 2012 I either joined Bing in 2012 or a left

473
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:53,140
thing in 2012 I don't remember the point of the story I think here and if

474
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,660
I go back in time as well I went back in into our podcast and look for what

475
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:03,490
was the date of the episode titled the conception of modern testing right that

476
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:08,610
was in 2018 which I believe you were already in unity oh yeah yeah for sure

477
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,970
I was well but right yeah we've been talking about we just didn't have a name

478
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,700
for it maybe we've been talking about modern testing for a long time right like

479
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:23,260
but it's the beginning right the my point is in terms of hey Alan did this

480
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,660
you know Alan keeps talking about all these principles and all these things

481
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,100
so how come teams is all screwed up the the one thing I'll say on that front is

482
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:41,570
you don't learn from success true only learn from failure and what I will say

483
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:48,250
is a lot of Alan's Alan and I have never had this good discussion but I am so

484
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,410
confident in what I'm about to say I'm gonna say it anyway you're wrong a lot

485
00:44:52,410 --> 00:45:00,210
of Alan's thought process around supportive of modern testing when he was

486
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:06,970
thinking through it he absolutely was considering what he views as personal

487
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:13,250
failures from his experience with teams right yeah I agree and there's there's

488
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,250
two things maybe to highlight there one is that definitely the modern testing

489
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,530
principles were nowhere near being formed at that point it took me going

490
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,490
back to managing a test team for a while at Unity to kind of think through

491
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:32,970
that as well as building that quality culture transition guide at Unity with

492
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:39,530
reflection on time I spent on Xbox and on teams doing coaching yeah those ideas

493
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:44,980
came primarily like even when I joined Unity back in a test manager role it

494
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:50,620
made me go back and think about what actually mattered and how testers should

495
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:55,260
work it's that's what I began to think about using it when you have dedicated

496
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,500
testers using them to accelerate accelerate the achievable quality or to

497
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,580
accelerate the team versus be a bottleneck and then building that

498
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,340
quality culture and then and then maybe that last principle came from my time at

499
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,860
Unity when you have dedicated testers you can use them to help expand the

500
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,900
testing abilities and know-how across the org and all that came from a lot of

501
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:24,500
reflection and in fact when I first gave the talk in 2017 let me think whenever I

502
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,460
gave that talk at test bash in Brighton the first time I give a public talk

503
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,940
about modern testing it started with the history all the things I had learned

504
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,860
from Xbox and then from teams and then from Unity and how those all came

505
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,540
together into the principles so back on teams I had a lot of good ideas I

506
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,340
learned how coaching worked I learned how to teach I began to realize that yes

507
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:52,020
developers can be very very good testers but my full thoughts on how to

508
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,860
achieve quality even though I gave a talk on testing without testers my full

509
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,500
thoughts on how to achieve quality without dedicated testing specialists

510
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,260
didn't fully come to fruition for a few years after that based on what I

511
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:11,020
learned there and if both you and I have multiple different experiences around

512
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,100
attempting the principles trying things out and going well that didn't

513
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,540
work that that that that not only didn't work like one of the things I think we've

514
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:29,460
talked about in the past in my view agile principles will far out produce not

515
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:36,460
only slightly it will far out produce waterfalls based mentality okay it far

516
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:45,560
but the one thing that is the Achilles heel to agile do you want to make a

517
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:52,740
singular guess before I drop the bomb nope go ahead the Achilles heel to agile

518
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:59,740
is command and control absolutely right there is that I have yet to find anything

519
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:07,660
with with agile that that successfully survives a hierarchical structure where

520
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:15,940
the hierarchy is is against it right or or or even either against it directly or

521
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:22,020
indirectly even micro management might instead of using quantification or other

522
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,860
other means a customer usage to to sort of drive decision-making so that's

523
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:34,540
something that I think is is it's actually one of the reasons why you make

524
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,100
fun of me all the time on this one but it's one of the reasons why I actually

525
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:47,380
still do favor the safe methods because safe actually tries to make the

526
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:54,650
management part of the agile process instead of say scrum that's another

527
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,170
conversation on their slack channel right now around sort of the failings of

528
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:06,970
scrum and scrum scrum has had the sort of history of of enforced autonomy

529
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:12,870
management's the man and scrum is anti the man right and I think that actually

530
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:18,910
holds it down or holds it back and creates limits yeah that's my philosophy

531
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:23,510
yeah I'm with you man okay so that's kind of the story you know we can go

532
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,150
deeper if there are more questions but that was way easier to talk about it

533
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,830
here cuz I think it's interesting to everybody else and I like I like where we

534
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,030
got with that then trying to have an answer in slack again if you want to see

535
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,110
these slack conversations or ask your own questions in slack you can go to

536
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,790
modern testing org and join our slack group there is no cost for that it is

537
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:45,070
absolutely free of course you get what you pay for which is me and Brent being

538
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,390
smart asses in slack but it's fun we have we have we have taco emoji so it

539
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:55,750
would give away yeah one one additional thing that I at least want to say is

540
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:04,140
despite what you feel about teams I will say teams has actually been in a

541
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:12,740
important asset to the globe during the pandemic times I totally agree and I

542
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:17,060
think it goes back to the fact that the vast majority of people who are using

543
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:21,540
office 365 or office subscriptions to their enterprise they're not using any

544
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,860
other collaboration tool and it just it just gives it to them in a way that's

545
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,340
comfortable and it integrates with the way they work and then one thing worth

546
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:37,420
sharing it so I totally get that but I'll mention a name the old VP he really

547
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,860
wanted to compete with slack I want to take out slack and and Stuart Butterfield

548
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,660
was worried for a while he's put out that that full page ad the day teams

549
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,140
came out which was kind of cool but it says welcome to the welcome to the game

550
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:55,060
but it really fits the niche because those office 365 companies that use that

551
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,420
and there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of users in that camp

552
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:05,350
they're not going out and getting slack licenses they they just get teams as

553
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,790
part of the package they already have it's very convenient works very well I'm

554
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:13,950
all it it fits there very well something else I was gonna say there but I forgot

555
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:19,350
and we're out of time anyway all right okay everybody thanks for being part of

556
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:26,100
our podcast today all three of you you and you and you I'll see you next time

557
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,380
I'm Alan I'm brain bye bye
