1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
I get what you're saying.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
It's all true.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm not sure if we're actually getting any deeper on this or actually I'm not sure where

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,220
we're going with this is my point.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:18,190
So welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,350
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership,

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,990
agile and anything else that comes to mind.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,430
Now on with the show.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,390
Zencaster, you're my.

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,980
Yes, I got to witness it.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,580
The long hard fought battle Alan had against the inanimate objects.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,460
Now I got to be nice here.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,780
Because remember last time Zencaster died on me in the middle and I was upset, but it's

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,860
okay.

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,220
This time I'm trying to be very nice to it.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,700
I know how to caress it.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,660
The audio was coming out the wrong speaker.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,460
So what you do to trick Zencaster into loving you again, because that's what we want to

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,460
do.

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,460
Want to trick it into loving us again.

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,460
That's all about relationship building.

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,340
You change the audio setting to something else, save that and then go back to the one

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,380
that it said it was doing before and it will suddenly work.

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,740
Feels like a bug to me.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,460
Now Zencaster and I love each other and we're going to love each other for about

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,460
the next 45 minutes.

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,980
And we're going to together when a man and his software love each other very much.

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,060
They come up with a podcast.

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,060
This is nearing creep.

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,060
Creepy.

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,060
Yeah, I know.

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,060
Yes.

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,420
And I don't.

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,250
I don't want to raise alarms.

35
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,930
But in terms of the little audio signal, I see yours.

36
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,930
No, no, no.

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,930
I don't see mine.

38
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,930
I see yours.

39
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,930
It's good.

40
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,930
Yeah.

41
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,930
So I see it.

42
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,370
It's a lot of editing and post-pros where I go bleep out the stuff.

43
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,970
I get rid of me.

44
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,010
I try and make myself sound smarter and Brent less dumb.

45
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,450
It's a lot of work, but it's fun.

46
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,370
What I want to kick off with here is really extending a little bit on our last podcast

47
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,530
with Dagna, but just really taking the elephant in the room and hugging it with both arms.

48
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:20,160
Yeah, that that was that was a bit coincidental, huh?

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,840
Well, you know, from my position, I, you know, I was I've been working on, you know, unfortunately,

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
the layoffs we had at Unity for several months.

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
So I knew that was going on while we were talking about that.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,840
But you know, the industry overall, there's a lot of a lot of folks we work with Jim Moore,

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
one of the three after 26 years of Microsoft was laid off.

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
I was not aware of that.

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,040
As well as did you ever work with David Klein on Xbox?

56
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
No.

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
It just is the new for a long time.

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,440
I mentioned him for a while, just really, really cool kid.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,760
I call him the kids younger than me, but he's probably your age.

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,960
Anyway, he was laid off also after 31 years.

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,360
It kind of blows me away.

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,440
And then I noticed your your name on our Zengcaster session, but still love you.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
Zengcaster is still employed.

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Yep.

65
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,950
Yep.

66
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,110
I have lots of thoughts and takeaways and some comments, but but how are you doing?

67
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,620
I mean, it's it's weird.

68
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,780
A lot of a lot of folks are no longer your coworkers.

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
What's that like?

70
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:30,970
Well, so it's first and foremost, it's it's horrible, right?

71
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:45,070
There's there are a lot of mentees, old, old friends, like rumors going around.

72
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,070
Anxiety is high.

73
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,150
I didn't know about Jim.

74
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,740
I'm still kind of reacting to that.

75
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,660
I want to tell a Jim story here in a little bit.

76
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,140
Remind me.

77
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:06,000
Jim is in one of the two two groups that I am aware basically got hammered.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,910
And there's another group that I've heard of.

79
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,470
But one of my buddies in that group, I still see that they are very much online.

80
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:25,350
So one of the things that's tough for me and we should talk about about you as well.

81
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,350
Right.

82
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:35,770
One of the things that's tough for me is I have I have a relatively large team for a frontline

83
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,770
manager.

84
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,990
I have a relatively large team and that's something that they want to talk about.

85
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,990
Right.

86
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,570
Like, well, how is this decided at this point in time?

87
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,430
It's it's not clear to me.

88
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,430
Right.

89
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,430
Well, is it all done at this point in time?

90
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,830
It's not clear to me.

91
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:04,760
I have worked with my team long enough to know for them to know that I'm going to be

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,790
transparent.

93
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,740
I may not.

94
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,380
For example, I do know something and I cannot share.

95
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:22,660
I will tell them, look, I know something that's related to that and I cannot share.

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,700
It'll be a different version of that.

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:33,580
But credibility is my currency and I'm not going to violate that.

98
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,260
And so I actually had a very long conversation with one of my employees yesterday and I said,

99
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,890
it's fun having a conversation around layoffs with a data science team.

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,890
Right.

101
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,130
Because I can go in to use data science terms.

102
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:56,210
I'm like, look, what you're asking me to do is build a predictive model where I I not

103
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,860
I not only do not know the the the label for the golden set, I don't know the features

104
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,510
for the golden set and I don't know the rules for the golden set.

105
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,830
So if I were to build a predictive model, like what you're what you're asking me to do

106
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:21,290
is is tell you, Britt, what's the probability that that I'm going to get laid off?

107
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,020
Literally is some number between zero and 100.

108
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,820
I am.

109
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Ask chat GPT.

110
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,980
Yeah.

111
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:38,280
And I said, and I'll be I'll be very honest with you, Alan.

112
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,000
For me, that's a little uncomfortable because all the other prior layoffs, I've been pretty

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,440
well connected to the communication network.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,820
Right.

115
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,660
I've been able to learn or glean more of what must be going on.

116
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,820
Pretty good at inferring from, oh, that team's doing making this decision.

117
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,340
This of the team over here is doing that decision.

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,020
Oh, OK.

119
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,900
The overlords must have been going down this path.

120
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,200
Right now, I don't I don't know the policy here.

121
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,360
And I said, there's two things.

122
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,640
Number one, this is a model that's in terms of predictive model.

123
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,160
This is a model that is 100 percent uncertainty.

124
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes.

125
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:33,340
Number two, in my view, the absolute worst thing I can do with my employees is give

126
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
them false hope.

127
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,780
Let me just build on a lot of what you said there.

128
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,820
So involved in building part of our model this time, it is not a repeatable model.

129
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,320
You would never use the same model for selection for two layoffs in a row.

130
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,000
So that even furthers the unpredictability problem you talked about.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,940
And inevitably, all models are wrong.

132
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
Some are useful.

133
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,140
I make sure I got that quote right.

134
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Make sure.

135
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,140
But it's true.

136
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,660
The model is wrong.

137
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,820
This is what is hard for me is one.

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,460
There's a couple of things that are hard for me.

139
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,620
One is the model is wrong.

140
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,550
I got it wrong, but it's impossible to get right.

141
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,780
I tried to get it as less as least wrong as I could.

142
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,180
And I know I didn't get it right.

143
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,820
And even if I go back in time and do it again, I would do something different.

144
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,820
I would get it wrong again.

145
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,140
It's impossible to get right.

146
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,020
There's a lot of guilt that goes with that.

147
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,150
And then when you've heard me talk about how psychological safety is just so

148
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,410
important on my teams and trust.

149
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,090
And then when things like this happen, it's my role to be the messenger for the team and

150
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,570
talk about why it happens and to share as much as I can.

151
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,890
But it's hard for me because I try and be ultra transparent.

152
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,930
There are legal reasons around this that make me I can't be as transparent as I want

153
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,210
to in everything that went into this, which is hard.

154
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,770
And then also just the fact that it happens resets that trust level on the team.

155
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,490
I have worked to go do again.

156
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,130
And that's hard also.

157
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,450
So yeah, it's rough.

158
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,660
I reread and I've been rereading the book I mentioned in our podcast with DAGNA, this

159
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,500
book called Healing the Wounds, Overcoming the Trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized

160
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,340
Organizations because it talks a little bit about the layoff process, but it talks a lot

161
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,940
about a lot more.

162
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,540
The bulk of the book, and you should read it too, is about what you and I are experiencing

163
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:38,040
is how to deal with being the survivor of a layoff because it feels fucking weird.

164
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:51,060
To me, my superpower that has helped me for so long in terms of surviving the company

165
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:59,220
is been fairly accurate around what sort of skills are going to be needed in the next

166
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,740
three to five years and making sure that I'm developing myself in that direction.

167
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,980
Learning what's important.

168
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,980
There's this old book I read years ago.

169
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:22,070
My dad was a director of program management and he was a big fan of books by an author

170
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,510
named Harvey McKay.

171
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,140
And I read, it was all about perspective setting.

172
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:42,280
We have seen all sorts of studies that employee engagement is a real important thing to build

173
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,880
within your team.

174
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,080
Yep, the most important thing actually.

175
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
It is.

176
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,440
The Lentione studies and research shows that engagement with work has a massively hard

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,200
correlation with the predictability and quality of what your organization produces, regardless

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,600
of whether it's software, widgets, sandwiches, whatever.

179
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,160
Engagement critical.

180
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,200
Yes, totally.

181
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,960
As you and I work very strong to make our teams feel like our families away from our

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,520
families.

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
One thing.

184
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,080
Let me interrupt you there because it's tough to even hear those words because when companies

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,720
do things like this, it's cogs in a machine.

186
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,200
It's reusable pieces.

187
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,260
It's hard.

188
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
That's what I was saying.

189
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:39,100
For me, a lesson I learned a long ago is that you absolutely should do that, but you should

190
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:47,850
also put in constant reminders that this is a business and that business decisions will

191
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:56,940
be made based off of business KPIs.

192
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,100
When I go into this, it's like, okay, what kind of a business would you like to work in?

193
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,180
One that feels like a family or one that doesn't?

194
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,740
Well, obviously, duh.

195
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,420
A very simple answer.

196
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,340
Just like all great things that can be overdone.

197
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,420
As you do that, you can't lose sight that it's a business.

198
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:27,180
And that is part of it that can ease the sting because what's happened a lot

199
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,140
of places, it's a shocking reminder.

200
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,540
Going back to the book, there's a bit of advice that he gave.

201
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:42,500
The single best way to assure you are not impacted by layoffs is to make sure you're

202
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,940
on the decision committee.

203
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,980
And it sounds like a tautology, but to me, it's direction setting.

204
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,230
Going back to modern testing principles.

205
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,070
Principle number one is not key just for testers.

206
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:06,230
It is key for everything you are doing in your career life.

207
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,550
And the slightly revised version that we have floating around.

208
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,550
Right.

209
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:21,990
It is in your corporate world, every decision you make should be around if you want to minimize

210
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,830
the probability and this is no guarantee.

211
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,550
But the only wisdom I have learned, if you want to minimize the probability of you being

212
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,380
impacted by a shocking layoff, you need to pursue what makes you happy.

213
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,940
That's obviously true.

214
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,180
But you need to, within those constraints around your motivations, your skill sets, or whatever,

215
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:50,040
you need to optimize all decisions you make around business impact.

216
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm thinking right now, I'm a data scientist.

217
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,240
Well, there's a very few of us.

218
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,960
Right now, that's a good optimization.

219
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,760
I am in Azure Core, which is a key.

220
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,840
It's not only the cloud is a key business of Microsoft, but I'm in Azure Core, which

221
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,030
is the key business unit of Azure.

222
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:17,790
I am having strategic impact across all of Azure.

223
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:28,340
These are all things that increase that probability of me providing business impact.

224
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,420
I get it.

225
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,380
And pushing back just a little bit.

226
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,380
I'm surprised.

227
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,620
I want to go back just a little bit, because I want to go back to engagement.

228
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,340
And the point is, I don't want to optimize what I do around making sure I don't get fired

229
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,060
because that's not engaging.

230
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,900
Engagement comes from three things.

231
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Research shows us three things.

232
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,260
You have to care about the work you're doing.

233
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
That's the matter to you.

234
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,260
Yes.

235
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,600
You need to know your manager cares about what you do.

236
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,140
Research shows this, and you need feedback.

237
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,900
Now that first one's really critical.

238
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,300
This is just kind of a technology as well.

239
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,900
If you like your work, you do better work.

240
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,740
Mastery, autonomy, and purpose.

241
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,180
Yes, going back to Dan Pink.

242
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,180
This is the purpose part.

243
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,340
God, I can't even think straight through all this.

244
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:23,220
What I worry about, and what you just said, is, is your purpose to not get fired?

245
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,290
No.

246
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,730
Because you made it sound like that a little, and that's where my pushback comes from.

247
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,450
I am going to restate what I said.

248
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:38,250
Every decision you make should be around optimizing business impact.

249
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,490
And I said that purposely.

250
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,490
It says the absolute worst thing you could do is take a defensive strategy.

251
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:50,890
I am going to do everything I can to avoid fill in the blank, painful thing.

252
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,450
That nearly always fails.

253
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,510
No, I get that.

254
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:08,180
What you want to do is create a positive impactful mission with one that would ideally also avoid

255
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,500
the thing that you're afraid of.

256
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,300
I used to tell people back in Microsoft, if you remember when we did the scoring system,

257
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,780
and you and I went through both of them.

258
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,580
I got 4.5 once.

259
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,900
Right.

260
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,020
And now my question is, okay, and which model was that?

261
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,940
Where 4.5 was good or bad?

262
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
It was good.

263
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
Right.

264
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,180
It's one of the best you could get was a five, but I never knew anyone that got a

265
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,260
five.

266
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,180
So I have gotten four O's in both models.

267
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:48,060
The end when you get that negative message, the absolute worst thing you could do is

268
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,260
respond out of fear and say, I got to do everything I can to avoid a four O next time.

269
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,100
Because I've heard of this rule.

270
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,860
If I get too many of these in a row, I'm fired or whatever.

271
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Right.

272
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,310
And that's the wrong thing to do.

273
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,310
So let's say a five O is the best, best thing.

274
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,220
And you got a two.

275
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,820
Right.

276
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,180
You do not try to avoid the two.

277
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,140
What you do is you have a conversation with your manager and say, yeah, that was a

278
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,900
sucky speed bump, but now let's have a coaching conversation around the reality

279
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,820
of what am I going to do to get a four?

280
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Sure.

281
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,500
And this goes back to purpose and it goes back to making sure you're valuable,

282
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,370
being, you know, it's your, you're valuable.

283
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,930
But in the end, as I discussed before, the model is unpredictable.

284
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,930
It is.

285
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,770
So you can do all that stuff and still lose your job.

286
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,770
Absolutely.

287
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:47,290
So, so even for me, even for me, like as I told you what I told my employees,

288
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,970
the model, do I feel safe right now?

289
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,050
No.

290
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,050
Right.

291
00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:02,370
I am beginning to hear rumors of the next set of dates when the next hammer is

292
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,810
likely to fall.

293
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,570
Is that going to impact me?

294
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,770
At that I can say yes, because either it's going to impact me directly or it's

295
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,010
going to impact me indirectly.

296
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:21,050
The only thing I can do about it now is any sort of safeguards that I might put

297
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,450
in play.

298
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,910
If you don't have a backup plan, yeah, maybe, maybe it's worthwhile spending a

299
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,070
few moments thinking up what that strategy might be, but don't over pivot

300
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,070
on it.

301
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,550
That's, that's number one.

302
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:43,170
And number two, what I am finding right now is that I'm finding that this

303
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:49,140
phenomenon is making me live in the present more than anything else.

304
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,420
It's like, yep, I, my career may die tomorrow.

305
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,500
So what I'm going to do, because I know that if it does, there's nothing

306
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,390
I can do about it right now.

307
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,390
There's no VP.

308
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,310
I could go argue, plead, beg.

309
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,590
There's nothing I can do about it right now, but it also seems some, my

310
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:18,580
pointless seems unwise for me to go ahead and book that $30,000 vacation

311
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
in the summertime.

312
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,940
Of course, of course.

313
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,420
So I think we're, I get what you're saying.

314
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
It's all true.

315
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,400
I'm not sure if we're actually getting any deeper on this or actually, I'm not

316
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,520
sure where we're going with this is my point.

317
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,720
So yet, yet try and keep your job, losing your job sucks.

318
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,440
And it's one thing, it's a little harder for me this time around with, I have

319
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,400
the people laid off my order.

320
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,680
For example, I know people like at Microsoft, you know, Jim and David, we

321
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,060
brought up before who are, you know, they're good.

322
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,700
They're really good at what they do.

323
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,700
But the challenge is now there's a hundred thousand software engineers out there

324
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,640
looking for jobs at the same time.

325
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,600
So I worry a little bit about the market.

326
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,040
Well, and they just take a little longer for them to find their next gig.

327
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,480
And here is the, here is the thing that you haven't thought about yet.

328
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,610
I think the people who, who at Microsoft, because again, I'm hearing

329
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,810
rumors that that there's, that there's multiple decision dates coming.

330
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:24,610
Right.

331
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,890
It's all going to close by, by March, but there's more events, right?

332
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,210
Well, guess what?

333
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,460
The people who got hit first, they have the advantage.

334
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,580
They have a headstart.

335
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,500
Right.

336
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,300
Right.

337
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,140
And yeah, it, I think I may have brought it up.

338
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,300
No, I have had, I brought it up in other conversations.

339
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,860
It reminds me of Moneyball, right?

340
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,420
Where there's one scene in the movie Moneyball where the guys, uh, the

341
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,100
guy says you have a decision, there's nothing you can do about it.

342
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,440
You're going to die tomorrow.

343
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,680
But the decision is how you can take a one bullet to the head or five to the

344
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,920
stomach and bleed to death.

345
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
That's, that's your only choices.

346
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,080
For me, that choice is clear, right?

347
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,920
If, if, if it's not avoidable, then make it as painless as possible.

348
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,470
Okay.

349
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,230
And please clue me into the metaphor.

350
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,030
No.

351
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:31,940
So if the issue is this is the first time where I've seen potentially big layoffs

352
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:39,690
throughout the company that has multiple dates and, and there was a big thing that

353
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:45,170
happened a couple or last week and people are like, okay, well, is the decision

354
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:45,610
closed?

355
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,610
Am I safe now?

356
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,930
And maybe it's, so it's, it's kind of.

357
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:59,230
For those of us currently, for those of us currently surviving and are

358
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,970
gonna get hit the next time, that's sort of been shot in the stomach, right?

359
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,170
So you're not only making it, you're not only killing them, but you're right.

360
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,970
They're anxious right now.

361
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:11,570
Right.

362
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:11,970
Yeah.

363
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,250
And that's something worth, worth talking about.

364
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,130
I don't think that's right.

365
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,770
No, I don't think it's right either.

366
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:23,550
But again, I can't recommend this book enough to explain like what you're going

367
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,430
through and the impact of layoffs.

368
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,630
So yeah, the anxiety of am I next?

369
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,910
Even if there aren't rumors, even if there aren't rumors, even if you've been

370
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,710
assured by your manager that your team won't be targeted for layoffs, you can't

371
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,670
help, but feel anxious about that.

372
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
You can't help, but worry about that.

373
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,180
And it affects your productivity.

374
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,580
It affects your engagement.

375
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,740
It affects your morale.

376
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:53,020
It accelerates the oncoming of burnout and many other things.

377
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,660
It's a traumatic experience.

378
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,100
And I don't think I use that word lightly there.

379
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,980
It is, it is a form of trauma to have to go through all this and there's deep

380
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:09,260
emotional effects on the, on everyone involved in things like this.

381
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,900
And it's tough.

382
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:10,900
Yeah.

383
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,660
And even, even surviving is not all that great, right?

384
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,140
No, it's not that, right.

385
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,380
That's the point.

386
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,460
That's exactly what I'm saying.

387
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:22,740
Because you still, you still have all this work that has to be done, but now

388
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,180
you have X percent people to do it with.

389
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,540
Yeah.

390
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,700
Let me talk about that for a second and read you a quick story from the book.

391
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,820
We can go back to the family metaphor of, of is your team a family or not?

392
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,180
So imagine a family, a father and a mother and four children.

393
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,980
The family has been together for a long time, living in a loving,

394
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,540
nurturing, trusting environments.

395
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,060
So I thought my org to be on my org to be.

396
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,380
The parents take care of the children who reciprocate by being good.

397
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,260
Every morning they have breakfast together, which is a bonding experience for them.

398
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,340
It's kind of like an organizational staff meeting.

399
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,300
One morning, the children sense that something is wrong.

400
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,180
The parents exchange furtive glances, appear nervous.

401
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,820
And after a painful silence, the mother speaks father and I have reviewed

402
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,060
the family budget, she says, looking down at her plate, avoiding eye contact.

403
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,900
And we just don't have enough money to make ends meet.

404
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,260
She forces herself to look around the table and continues as much

405
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,980
as we would like to.

406
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,140
We just can't afford to feed and clothe all four of you.

407
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,460
After another silence, she points a finger.

408
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,780
You too must go.

409
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,360
It's nothing personal, explains the father as he passes out a sheet of paper.

410
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,560
Each of the children, as you can see by the numbers in front of you,

411
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,320
it's simply an economic decision.

412
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,840
We really have no choice.

413
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,040
We have arranged for your aunt and uncle to help you get

414
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,560
settled to aid in your transition.

415
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,420
There's more.

416
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,060
The next morning, the two remaining children are greeted by a table

417
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,300
on which only four places have been set.

418
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,260
Two chairs have been removed.

419
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,820
All physical evidence of the other two children have vanished.

420
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,080
The emotional evidence is suppressed and ignored.

421
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,200
No one talks about the two who are no longer there.

422
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,920
The parents emphasize to the two remaining children, the survivors,

423
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,960
that they should be grateful since after all, you've been allowed

424
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,720
to remain in the family to show their gratitude.

425
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,360
The remaining children will be expected to work harder on the family chores.

426
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,160
The father explains that the workload remains the same, even though

427
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,480
there are too few of you.

428
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
The mother reassures them that this will make us a closer family.

429
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,110
Eat your breakfast children and treats the father.

430
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,110
After all, food costs money.

431
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,340
Oh, that's amusing.

432
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,050
It's it's amazing because it's sad.

433
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,010
Well, it's.

434
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,500
There's there's some there's some real parallels there.

435
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,760
You know, I had to deliver one of these layoff messages myself and it sucked.

436
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:44,790
Right.

437
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,470
That the reason why your story you just shared actually works.

438
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:57,180
And the one thing that's the one thing that's missing from really the story

439
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,980
is right, the fear that the mother and father have around

440
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,820
uncle or our cousin, Bob,

441
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,220
or the two children leaving and suing them.

442
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,100
So it's not just a business reality, but a lot of the constraints that happen

443
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,080
is because we live in a litigious society

444
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,520
and you just can't you can't be real

445
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,740
because that could make things even worse.

446
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,700
100 percent, 100 percent.

447
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,340
I that that's I.

448
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,270
Yeah, absolutely true.

449
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,910
So it's a mess and it's again, you have anxiety because you've heard rumors

450
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,910
of things coming up and it's hard because, you know, I think we need to read

451
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,830
everything we've talked about.

452
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,750
It's just the aftermath.

453
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,430
And here's what bugs me.

454
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,310
Here's what bugs me.

455
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,070
I didn't look this up ahead of time, but there is data and articles

456
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,110
I've seen that show that layoffs make a very

457
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,870
they should ask chat GPT about this, but they make a very minimal to zero impact

458
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,170
on revenue and and margin, meaning

459
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,500
the effect of come on with the productivity hit

460
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,690
and everything else involved.

461
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,770
You don't really save the company save much less money than they think they do.

462
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,000
VLF. Yeah, I would.

463
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
I would want to see that.

464
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,800
I saw one article.

465
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,680
I only glanced at it.

466
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,020
But so anyway, maybe that's not true.

467
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,980
I don't know.

468
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,220
I mean, one of our readers will dig that up.

469
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,980
So we talked a lot about layoffs.

470
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:44,020
Yep. We talked a little bit about like the aftermath of I worry with myself

471
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,060
and especially reflecting on our conversation with Dagna again on burnout.

472
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,620
It's like I am like myself.

473
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,300
I am angry more often.

474
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,180
I have less tolerance for

475
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,060
less tolerance in general.

476
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,260
I I have a good guess for the missing the fill in the blank word,

477
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,860
but I won't share it.

478
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,420
Yeah, I want it to be great to have if Jim, if you're listening,

479
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,740
you want to be on the podcast sometime, just get on here.

480
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,300
We'll get you get you to tell them stories.

481
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,540
But I'm going to tell a story about Jim,

482
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,540
because it goes back to once in a while in this podcast,

483
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,690
I talked to one of my employees this week,

484
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,890
one of my original employees at Unity, and we talk all the time and and a

485
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:32,210
rasmus and he was talking about the fact that we never talk about testing

486
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,930
on this podcast anymore. So that's all right.

487
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,570
We were talking about the right stuff.

488
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,170
Talk about what's relevant.

489
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,610
If there are things you want us to talk about,

490
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,010
what you do is you join our Slack group and you can get there by going to

491
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,130
modern testing dot org, clicking on the link,

492
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,290
and then you can join it and go to the mailbag channel and tell us what to

493
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,090
talk about or general or anywhere.

494
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,330
It just it's a hodgepodge.

495
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,770
We do take a lot of input from that community and we'll talk about things.

496
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,610
We'll talk about them.

497
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,050
Otherwise, we're going to talk about whatever we want.

498
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:05,210
I don't know what Brent is showing me, but it is showing me a picture that he drew.

499
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,490
I don't know what's going on.

500
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,490
This is so weird.

501
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,370
My number one memory of Jimbo.

502
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,170
Jim, yeah, we had these cameras, two Jim stories.

503
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,730
We had these really kind of interesting roundtable cameras.

504
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,730
What did we use them with?

505
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,450
I guess we must have used Link or Office Communicator.

506
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,150
And what it was was this camera that sat in the middle of the table

507
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,140
with this little circle on top, and it would detect who was talking

508
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,460
and change the camera to point you at who was talking.

509
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,140
And Jim didn't like that.

510
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,020
So we hung a little sticky face, a little sticky note in front of it

511
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,060
with a drawing of a face.

512
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,260
So every time he talked, it showed this little sticky note.

513
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,140
That's what Brent showing to the camera right now.

514
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,970
But that was the story I was going to tell.

515
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,170
Microsoft, they may still have this, but it's all self-serve

516
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,730
creating a new distribution list, a new group equivalent of a Google group.

517
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,130
You go to this tool that looks like it was written in 1989.

518
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,650
Is it still the same tool, Brent?

519
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,490
What tool?

520
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,610
The tool to create a new, I forget what it's called.

521
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,370
The tool to create an auto group, the tool to create a new mailing list.

522
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,280
Oh, no, that's that's probably changed like four times.

523
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,520
Oh, OK. But really early on,

524
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,780
Jim created because anyone could create a group.

525
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,100
I've created thousands of Microsoft, probably.

526
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,420
I'm sorry for my email sins of the past.

527
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,830
But Jim created a group called Null.

528
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,950
It was just him and a couple of people at least used it to,

529
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,870
you know, kind of a joke, Dev Null.

530
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,900
And just it was just a group called Null Forever until it wasn't.

531
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,800
One day when Jim was working on Xbox, he's it came.

532
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,240
He was looking a little white.

533
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,240
He came out and told us that all of a sudden he was getting random emails

534
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,600
not addressed to him all over the from all over the company

535
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,600
with some of them, some private and sensitive information.

536
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,560
Oh, geez.

537
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,240
What what bug did he take advantage?

538
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,400
No, let me out.

539
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,880
Was it called null or was it called the null string?

540
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,360
No, it was called null and you L.L. the string.

541
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,320
OK, so Jim is so ethically responsible.

542
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,320
He blows me away.

543
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,810
He immediately created a folder for all these things to go to contacted

544
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,810
exchange like a VP in exchange is on the phone with him in like five minutes

545
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,970
going, what what is going on?

546
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,730
And they changed something.

547
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,650
It started sending a bunch of random mails.

548
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,410
I don't know. I don't know what the bug was, but it was hilarious.

549
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,370
So the reason I thought of it recently was Jim.

550
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,850
The reason I found out Jim was laid off is he you know, LinkedIn

551
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,010
is an awkward place to go now because 80 percent of the posts

552
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,210
are people saying I was laid off for my job looking for work.

553
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,770
Yeah, Jim went to post.

554
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,330
He posted. It's really funny.

555
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,410
He went to fill out like I don't know,

556
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,410
he showed a little picture of the form and where you put your company name.

557
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,900
They put like ex like, for example, ex Microsoft.

558
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,340
I thought it's funny because it's like ex Microsoft.

559
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,470
I replied to him.

560
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,390
I said, Jim, knowing you, you have to make your company name null

561
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:23,820
and see what happens.

562
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,460
Yeah, it's a bummer.

563
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,140
So I I also feel bad because I screwed up Jim's life.

564
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,180
I I made Jim come to work on my team.

565
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,340
Jim worked on teams for a while.

566
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,860
Yeah, I made him come work for me on teams because I wanted to do

567
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,140
because Jim does awesome work and I wanted to bring his energy there.

568
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,780
And he didn't want to come to downtown Bellevue, but I convinced him to do it.

569
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,020
And then he came and then I and then I quit.

570
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,990
But he went back to Internet Explorer after that, where he where he worked

571
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,520
for a long time.

572
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,160
I hope Jim's doing well, but I love that null story.

573
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
It took this is great.

574
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,890
This is like as a tester, you may go, I'm going to try null as a group name.

575
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,690
OK, nothing weird happens.

576
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,570
It's fine. It's it's the long, slow hunch.

577
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,810
It took like six, seven, 10 years for that null distribution list

578
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,680
to become a bug.

579
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,280
There are similar things.

580
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,860
So there was this old tool that I built to back back.

581
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,980
This was back in the raid days.

582
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,220
Do you remember raid?

583
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,300
Raid kills bugs dead. Yeah. Yeah.

584
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,420
So raid was one of the raid stories to raid was one of the first

585
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,260
bug database management systems Microsoft had. Right.

586
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,780
And it was a piece of crap, but it worked.

587
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,340
It was better than whatever was before.

588
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,220
I don't know that I don't know that product studio ended up being better than.

589
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,340
Right. But no, but I finish your story.

590
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,820
I'll tell a raid story. OK.

591
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,100
So I had an auto mailer.

592
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,660
This is back in the early days of the exchange, which much like every

593
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,360
early product team, the stupid vanity metrics was the only thing that mattered.

594
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,160
Right. And we are trying to ship and we had too many

595
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,520
resolved bugs that weren't closed.

596
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,920
Right. So my boss asked me to create a an auto nagger.

597
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,060
I would have just closed all the bugs, but whatever.

598
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,260
That's what I would do today.

599
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,060
And I've had conversations.

600
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,620
I literally have had conversations with my senior executive.

601
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,020
I'm like, look, I will look you straight in the eye and just tell you straight up.

602
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,980
I think this is the most efficient thing to handle it right now.

603
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,460
If it hasn't been touched in two years, just close them all

604
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,460
because if it's important and still relevant, it will come back.

605
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,320
Yes. Oh, my God.

606
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,800
What this thing did.

607
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,480
So if you remember, if it wasn't assigned to anybody,

608
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,680
you would assign it to active.

609
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,280
Yes, I remember this now. Remember that?

610
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,040
OK. My thing would look OK.

611
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,720
Let's take out everything that's not assigned to active.

612
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,320
And I will I will send it to whoever.

613
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,220
No problem. Well, then I discovered

614
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:16,060
that with an exchange, it was very common to assign it to DCR.

615
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,980
Well, I remember DCR design change review or something.

616
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,740
Design change request. OK. Right.

617
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,860
This is how they they hacked that.

618
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,260
It's not a bug. It's actually somebody filing a future work item.

619
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,660
And I didn't change my code because it turned out all those mails bounced.

620
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,380
Therefore, it's no big deal.

621
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,820
And tell some poor dude joined Microsoft

622
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,900
who got the email address DCR.

623
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,580
And you and you completely filled his inbox.

624
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,380
I'm freaking day one.

625
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,620
I hammered the crap out of the guy.

626
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,740
He's like, why, why, why are you doing this to me?

627
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,340
And I'm like, oh, crap.

628
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,260
Yeah, you may want to talk for multiple other reasons.

629
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,780
You may want to talk to I.T.

630
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,540
about changing your email before you get too used to it,

631
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,500
because you're going to get every bad, badly designed

632
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,380
auto nagger sending crap to you.

633
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,980
So, by the way, sometimes you should look and see if Microsoft

634
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,220
has given Alan P.A. to anybody else yet.

635
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,860
My raid story is when I first started.

636
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,700
Let's go look right now.

637
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,780
I can't remember the version numbers and I wanted to find like a

638
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,980
I wanted to find the app for a screenshot for how we test off Microsoft.

639
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,180
Even then, it was too old.

640
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,460
But whatever the version, this is just classic hacking.

641
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,140
Whatever version of raid it was when I joined Microsoft,

642
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,340
it had a database limit of around 30,000.

643
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,420
It would just stop working once you got like 31,000 bugs in it,

644
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,820
which sounds like a lot, but Windows 95 was a shit show

645
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,810
and with a bunch of customer reported bugs in there, too,

646
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,850
that end up being like grouped into one bug.

647
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,090
So there was a lot of a lot of stuff in there.

648
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,130
I think two or three times during the Windows 95 cycle,

649
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,210
we had to do this migration where you take

650
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,810
all of the resolved and only resolved and active bugs

651
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,890
and at the lock raid, all is resolved and active

652
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,770
and move into the new database.

653
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,920
And then you start from there.

654
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,680
So you start with, you know, 5000 and build up again.

655
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,680
Yeah, I've just hilarious.

656
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,440
I executed multiple DB migrations.

657
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,160
I'm extremely grateful that every single time

658
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,000
it went off smoothly without error at all.

659
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,480
I actually wrote a bug tracking tool at Mittysoft.

660
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,360
So I was there before Microsoft.

661
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,160
I didn't know what I was doing about once.

662
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,840
I mean, I really nothing.

663
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,160
I knew nothing about what I was doing.

664
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,520
It worked until it didn't.

665
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,520
So at least once a day, I had to had to run an auto

666
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,480
repair on the database and restart.

667
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,800
And it's just I was bad.

668
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,600
I like it was it was horrible.

669
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,400
I could do much better today.

670
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,080
I think I wrote it.

671
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,120
I think I wrote it in Visual Basic.

672
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,130
Right. But with some access database,

673
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,210
we've talked about this before.

674
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,890
Well, perhaps we have the bug database today

675
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,370
is for me is very simple.

676
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,370
It's my count.

677
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,650
It's by Kanban board and the number of bugs on

678
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,490
listed on the board is no more than 10.

679
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,450
And they're all gone in 48 hours.

680
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,690
And maybe real quickly, it's worth mentioning is

681
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,410
the last thing on LinkedIn there with someone posted around

682
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,330
having a zero bug backlog.

683
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,050
And what was interesting is there a bunch of comments

684
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,410
from the traditional testers, I'll call them like, well,

685
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,210
let's talk about what bugs are and maybe it's OK.

686
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,610
It's like you guys don't get it.

687
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:51,850
What it means is deal with it or deal with it now or close it.

688
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,890
No, that's it's deal with it now.

689
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,330
Yeah, right. Either way. Right.

690
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,170
And they miss the point on it, but I just thought it was interesting.

691
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,490
Like they zero having zero bugs is a good thing.

692
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,990
And the thing I pointed out that kind of quieted people

693
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,790
or they just ignored me because they get mad at me

694
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,030
because I have weird ideas like not having testers on on development teams.

695
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:19,250
And I just pointed out that how much time do teams waste

696
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,330
re-reviewing resolved bugs or re-reviewing bugs

697
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,610
and deciding not to do anything with them?

698
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,290
Just close them. Either just deal with them.

699
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,060
Deal with them. Do something with them.

700
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,500
Don't let them sit around.

701
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,980
So anyway, we got there from there, from there, which was fun.

702
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,120
We should probably close for today.

703
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,520
We got things to do. Get back on track.

704
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,440
Brent is eating during the last 10 minutes of the podcast here.

705
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,280
So I will try and edit out the lip smacking.

706
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,840
And and you cannot imagine the pain it is to be the A in A.B. testing.

707
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,350
Anything to say for yourself, Brent?

708
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,340
I can imagine the pain.

709
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,420
And now. Oh, wait, wait.

710
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,060
Now he's talking into his hand.

711
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,420
I'm looking at the agenda.

712
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,820
You had a question about analytics.

713
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,260
Now, Brent, I don't have time to talk about analytics.

714
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,100
We'll talk about analytics next.

715
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,340
Well, then do the question as a cliffhanger.

716
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
I don't know what the question is. I've forgotten.

717
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,860
Oh, all right.

718
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,060
Okay, then.

719
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,100
The cliffhanger is this, this.

720
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:26,540
I have never been a fan of movies or TV series based on video game

721
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,000
because they always screw them up.

722
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,730
I have changed my mind.

723
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,130
Go watch The Last of Us on HBO.

724
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,220
New series on new shows on Sundays.

725
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,620
It is amazing.

726
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,300
What is that based off of?

727
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
The Last of Us.

728
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,460
I have not played or seen post apocalyptic zombies.

729
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,200
Oh, I did the what was the infected by infected by mushrooms.

730
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,640
Yeah, I don't know how this is going to make you feel,

731
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:01,600
but I hear rumors of a studio making a feature film based off of Fallout.

732
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,610
Don't like it. It's going to suck.

733
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,090
But then that said, Starfield coming someday soon.

734
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,090
I know I'm watching for Starfield.

735
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,290
It's from the makers of my two favorite games ever.

736
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,050
Fallout and Skyrim.

737
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,890
I can't wait.

738
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:21,250
And and I'll close on one Fallout update last.

739
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,890
Sometime ago, I think I I don't know if I spent a little podcast or told you,

740
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,410
but I've gotten back into Fallout 76.

741
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,930
I had I had a lot.

742
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,450
I just basically wiped my old character and start again back at level one.

743
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,610
I am now back to the same level I was previously.

744
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:46,270
And I will say I am enjoying the game.

745
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,510
It's nowhere as near as good as four or five, but I am joining the game

746
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:55,150
way better than I should go play it again.

747
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,710
I've played a little bit.

748
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,790
I've been so much for ending on time.

749
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,270
I bought a switch and I've been playing Mario Odyssey all the time.

750
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,020
Oh, I heard about that.

751
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,100
I haven't played it yet.

752
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,140
It's we have two switches.

753
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,820
All right. This is a good place to.

754
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
All right, everybody.

755
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
Thank you for hanging out with us on the E.B.

756
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,620
testing podcast.

757
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,380
I'm a I'm not.
