00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,440
Hello again everyone. Good morning. He's Brent. He's Alan

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,720
Welcome to another episode of a B testing happy to have you here. Good to see you Brent. Good to see you, too

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,720
I'm recording on a Monday. How is your weekend?

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,500
It was great. I finally won some points from the family

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,870
Did you just spend the weekend away from them?

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,360
No

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,440
Did you at this point in time? I still have my daughter who still likes me. Okay, that's good. Yeah, good. Just

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
Just make a bunch of food for them what you do. How'd you win some points?

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,720
I did actually make something about tell me about the point scoring system. I finally put the pool up. Oh

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,100
And it perfect time is supposed to be hot hot hot it this week

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,570
It took me two days to put the pool up

12
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,970
Yeah, because I could only stand being out

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,650
side doing

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,090
Manual labor in the full Sun for like an hour at a time

15
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,170
Well, there are things called mornings and evenings where it's a little cooler. I had the plan to do it in the morning

16
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,510
But my daughter got up and wanted to play and that sounded like more fun than putting up the pool. I suppose cool

17
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,020
This is episode 86 by the way

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,600
It is if you're new to a be testing this is the podcast by Alan and Brent that's the a and the B

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,860
Where we talk about?

20
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,220
Testing sometimes a lot of software engineering software quality

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,120
Of course modern testing principles have been the topic

22
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,380
For the last many many episodes. Yeah, you can go to modern testing org and read those

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,820
And we have been doing recently some deeper dives medium dives spending about an episode each discussing them

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,940
Drill ins drill ins we're gonna call them. Is that a Microsoft term?

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,180
Maybe maybe well, it's definitely management

26
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,760
Management-speak. I like what they say. Let's double click on that here that one. Let's double click and shift left

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,640
Let's I want to shift out

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,220
Shift out. I'm gonna just gonna drop. You know what I'm gonna do shift up

29
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,060
I mean, there's so many directions to shift I know and I don't have nearly as many meetings

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,420
In fact, I have one-on-ones and then like two or three other meetings a week

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,220
But I wish I had more cuz I one thing I would like to do cuz it's fun. You wish I'm sorry

32
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,620
No, no, no, you wish you had more meetings

33
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,380
I wish I had some bad meetings cuz I wish I I wanted it go like

34
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,420
You know to my car just just to go to meetings and have some of the bad ones again

35
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,380
Where I could just drop random buzzwords that mean nothing and see if they catch on

36
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,730
like we should shift out on that or

37
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,650
That'd be great

38
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,970
Hold on a second. Let's right-click on that and

39
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,200
And get some more context

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Yeah, so the trick is to come up with something entirely new though. Oh

41
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,090
Yeah, yeah, cuz everyone's

42
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,930
You know, they're just evolving

43
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,120
Like why is it left shift? Why isn't it right shift? Well shift, right? Right

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,430
Correct. So, uh, I mean you got the double entendre with right. So if you shifted right

45
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,590
Right, the direction doesn't matter and you it could be implying, you know, you're going more correct. You're shifting to correct. Oh

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,840
It could be it could be so I need to think for a minute. What's that? What's like a computing term?

47
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,480
It hasn't been used in a managerial speak

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,100
I'm thinking something like a long lines of distributed networks. They're all the rage right now

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,060
You got big data, but you know if you try to invent something now, you're like five years too late

50
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,850
Alright, I'm gonna come up with those so you can send those in to the mailbag at a B testing

51
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,770
Sure yet another place where a B testing adds value to the world. We'll start creating whole new buzzwords. Sure

52
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,330
Sure, that's our that's our value to the world in between last time and this time. I

53
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,470
Spoke to the internet a little bit about

54
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,470
Modern testing again. I did an AMA and asked me anything for a Ministry of test and

55
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,020
I will there is a recording of it available

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,780
I will put in a link if I don't you can yell at me on Twitter

57
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:38,080
But I will try and remember when I post this show to put a link to the recording where I answered a bunch of questions

58
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,840
Hosted by our good friend Vernon and I answer questions about modern testing

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,360
Yeah, I went back and I watched that video first off it was your video I threw it worse

60
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,880
I forgot it's a video. So I totally shouldn't have picked my nose so much. You really shouldn't have

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,680
And it was shocking. I'm like, oh my god Alan's face. I'm like is the whole world ready for this

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,800
There's a reason we do a podcast. There's a reason we do a podcast

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,720
Yeah, mostly me but yeah

64
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
for sure

65
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,820
I am certainly glad I did not join you in that adventure because some of those questions were really hard

66
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,320
I'm glad you didn't join because you give really long answers and I gave longer answers

67
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,080
We got to the end Vernon tried to go rapid-fire, but I couldn't let it go

68
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,670
Sometimes right there was one time you were like no

69
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
And then I elaborated

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
We're going to dive into

71
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:50,320
principle number five five of seven and this is the one about the customer and

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,980
Surprisingly, there's a little bit of controversy around this one. We'll go into anything else before we dive in

73
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,440
You know, let's go to go. Okay again. You can read these on modern testing org, but principle number five says

74
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,960
We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Agreed. Yeah

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,080
Okay, and thank you for listening to a be testing

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,560
Yeah, yeah, that was one of your questions on on AMA

78
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
before we reflect back on that

79
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,620
briefly

80
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,460
Tell me and I'm gonna go to the controversy to the controversy the question, but before we do that, tell me

81
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,420
Why is this the principle? What why is this worth bringing up along with the other six?

82
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,520
The number one reason and I've cited this over number one

83
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,280
The I've cited this over and over again. One of the things that I think

84
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
especially

85
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,440
true for those of us who have been in the industry for a long time and

86
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:10,070
It is sort of seductive to believe that hey, I've been doing this forever. I know what I'm doing

87
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,030
You've seen a lot of folks along those lines

88
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,830
but there is a

89
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:25,100
forgetting is how I'll call it as I cited from Tom Popendike over and over again

90
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,620
No customer ever in the history of the world has ever wanted software

91
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,330
Correct in any way shape or form

92
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,690
What do they want before you go on they want their problem solved?

93
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,310
Absolutely. We need to remember that that means

94
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,780
There is a risk and I have observed this and I'm highly certain you have as well

95
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
that there is

96
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,950
trust in

97
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:02,510
the test community that when they're given a requirement stock or when they're told something from

98
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,310
their PM

99
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,120
that

100
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,540
That actually is going to solve somebody's problem down the road

101
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,320
A big portion of this principle is intended to force people to think about

102
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
What are they doing?

103
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,820
That is actually solving a customer problem theoretically

104
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,510
versus actually and it's it's to force the

105
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
The modern tester to go

106
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,220
No matter how right I think I am

107
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,060
It's still just a theory

108
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:49,300
It's a hypothesis. It's a hypothesis. You want to pick up? Yeah, sure. So what I've

109
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
What I've seen and to build on them

110
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,740
We can both reflect and probably anybody who's been doing software for a reasonable amount of time

111
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,700
Reasonable amount of time or any but probably a lot some of you

112
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Maybe this week last week

113
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,660
You are on a team or you've seen teams who build software

114
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Because they think it'll be cool

115
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,600
Or we're doing this feature because the we like it without often thinking about what problem are you solving?

116
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,760
It's amazing sometimes when you talk to teams and just ask them that question

117
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,280
What problem are we solving with this? They'll eat they'll use it that isn't solving a problem

118
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,600
And well, what's what's what's the customer value of this?

119
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,040
they'll use it and

120
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:44,240
Well, I've seen this over and over and Brent's laughing but you think about it. It's it's they're not quite sad because evil

121
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:52,000
but in my experience, but generally darn close I I've told the story for years about shimmery blue menus and

122
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and

123
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,360
There was a time at Microsoft and this is a

124
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,300
A joke I used to make when I was teaching courses ten years ago

125
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,640
It's been a long time about shimmery blue menus because shimmery blue menus are not a real feature

126
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,700
I'm just these are my canonical example of something you're building because you think it's cool

127
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,820
But nobody really needs it and what happens is the program manager

128
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,460
Wants thinking about features they need to do they go what about shimmery blue menus

129
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,540
You know, huh? We should do shimmery blue menus and then someone will say

130
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
maybe we'll say

131
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,740
Problem does that solve and they'll say uh customers need it and they'll justify it

132
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,540
They'll go to a customer and say hey, do you think we need shimmery blue menus? They go sir, whatever

133
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,160
Customers are demanding shimmery blue menus. They're waiting for this feature. We got to go do it

134
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,140
maybe that's a little bit of a stretch, but there's so much reflection in my past of doing features and

135
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,100
The build it and they will come mentality field field of dream software. Yes, we're gonna build this thing and

136
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,420
We'll give it to you after a long development cycle and we trademark feel the dream software

137
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,630
and even though feel the dream is probably and in the end you will like it, but

138
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,410
Right, oh this part I've seen over and over again I have

139
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,520
This is hyperbole, but there is there wait hyperbole on the a B testing

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,820
Whoa, I'm gonna be careful because it's modern

141
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,080
We're much more modern world, but let's just say I

142
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Don't know five ten years ago

143
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,080
it was impossible to have a conversation with the PM and not walk away with the sense that

144
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,360
They were the next Steve Jobs. Oh god, right? It's it's

145
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,760
requirements stock what a lot of the requirements stock is is built off of

146
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,680
Processes similar to what Alan just described. It is hey a customer

147
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,920
PM

148
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,500
they have their own day job to do and sometimes it's calling out the customers and

149
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,860
They will call out to one or two and and establish a pattern off of that

150
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,380
Now is that a pattern? No, of course not

151
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,340
however, their job is to get new features in and

152
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,460
If they they've encountered a new

153
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,490
Requirement that they could build upon that's fantastic

154
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,330
right that they're able to do add that requirement into the dock and and

155
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,700
Get engineering rolling now, it's interesting because you say shimmery blue

156
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,310
I've actually

157
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,500
Had to deal with that and it literally was blue. It wasn't shimmery

158
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,600
Years ago. I was an MSTV and Microsoft was building the software for Comcast and

159
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,960
Comcast rejected our our

160
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,760
Software not once but twice

161
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,090
Because we had the wrong

162
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
blue in our CSL and

163
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,470
And I'm like

164
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,910
Wow really

165
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,230
Yes, and again twice

166
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,670
There's a design choice there and there's plenty stories about Google trying out 50 different or ever in shades of blue

167
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,670
It was for their links for they chose the right one

168
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,470
In the case of of

169
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:39,470
Comcast right blue is part at least it was back then now they got this red black and white team with their Xfinity stuff but

170
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,310
blue

171
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,510
Blue was part of the brand Donna get ditched cable. I don't know. I was gonna bring something

172
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:52,350
Oh, I had a little I glazed over for a minute there while my PTSD kicked in on when just showing out

173
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,630
When the job his book came out or the first couple jobs books came out after he passed away. Oh

174
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,510
Oh my god, so many when there was one in particular

175
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,700
I'll finish my thought a bunch of people decided to start comparing themselves to Steve Jobs

176
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,940
Literally, and there's one high-level

177
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,900
Test director you and I both know I won't shame him on the air who who in a meeting

178
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,720
no

179
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,240
metaphor aside flat-out said

180
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,760
Because I'm making this choice this is what Steve Jobs do he basically called himself Steve Jobs

181
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:35,440
And that was that was like oh god, please please let it in please let it in but even Steve Jobs

182
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm so whining back. I'm like

183
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,740
We don't know any test directors

184
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,470
Because they're gone

185
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:52,270
We did they were Peter principled up to a level far beyond the capability and since retired once

186
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,910
Once in the new world figured out they had no, you know, it's funny

187
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,590
I'm because we know so many of those folks and

188
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Several of them are alike. I

189
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,660
Cannot guess who it is at the moment. I'll let you know off-air. Yeah

190
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,040
I have several guesses. Yeah, I'm pretty sure all of them having that conversation. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you could nail it

191
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
wasn't Steve Jobs who when there was the

192
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,440
camera which iPhone it was but there was an antenna issue and

193
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,010
Wasn't he the one that said it's cuz they're holding it wrong. I don't think

194
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,810
That I think that was one of his but that's a great example

195
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,990
I mean it doesn't matter and the customer customer is the only one capable to evaluate quality and they

196
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,190
Can't hold the phone. However, they frickin want to hold the phone, right? Right

197
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,620
This is still prevalent

198
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,200
In today's world like I have conversations similar to this over and over and over again

199
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:03,160
This principle is essentially the modern testing version of the customer is always right

200
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:10,160
Perhaps perhaps and so let's talk about which it makes so much common sense, but let me play

201
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,960
Simon Devils advocate. I'm gonna bring up the controversy and let you there's believe it or not. There is controversy around

202
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
this testing principle

203
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,220
Probably this one is

204
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Probably second on the if you're gonna rank them in order of controversy behind principle number seven

205
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,980
Some of you are going how the hell can this be controversial? But let me bring up a few points for you. So

206
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,980
Here's the easy one as testers

207
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
We are the customer

208
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,420
We're the last line of defense Brent. We're the only ones capable of

209
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:52,000
Sympathizing and making sure the customer is getting it. So really as a tester. I am the customer

210
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
No

211
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,120
So

212
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,160
Yeah, that that's a little bit of a softball, but no, I mean no no, it's just no you're not the customer and and

213
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,960
I'm I figured this part out years ago, but doesn't matter how much you're trying to replicate. Here's an example

214
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,740
Do you remember int int?

215
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,740
Remember data type no int the integration environment. Oh my god

216
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,700
There is a time early in the services world of Microsoft where there's this massive

217
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,560
Ridiculous integration environment that was done

218
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,560
It was people tried to do testing there and they wanted it to replicate production as much as they could and it never even got close

219
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,120
never ever ever ever and

220
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,870
and

221
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,710
They held on to the theory that it would

222
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,010
Hindsight 2020 I'm not at all certain why

223
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,810
But the biggest cause

224
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,930
And this was actually something that test played into it one of the one of the problems with with our

225
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,330
Automation

226
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:14,690
We would target automation that would deploy out in it and one of the biggest issues with it with a with a

227
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,290
non-prod int environment

228
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,540
Particularly with how automation was deployed is it was always covering

229
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
the clean room

230
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,620
Scenario sure and I have nothing against integration environments and doing testing in some sort of pre-production environment that there's

231
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Plenty of reasons to do that

232
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,380
But do not ever kid yourself and think that your pre-production environment

233
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:50,220
Whatever you call it is a reasonable facsimile for production. Yeah, absolutely it it is

234
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,840
It simulates production environment exactly once in its lifetime

235
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,680
And even even then not exactly because it's not running on the same hardware

236
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:10,320
It's it's it's running differently in production. It could I mean, I mean that's still it's still possible

237
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,960
Do your teams at Microsoft use Docker? Did teams use Docker at Microsoft? Oh my

238
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,920
God, you know what just before coming in here. I was gonna I was gonna share with you off the air

239
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,790
around

240
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,870
Dude, I don't understand how we got stuff done back in the day without containers

241
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,270
because that that Docker has been one example where it's

242
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,430
Containerization has helped with test environments making them much closer again for one time only

243
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:48,790
But giving you a much closer to production environment as much easier and quicker to set up and tear down. Yeah containers

244
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,630
my experience with containers

245
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,310
they keep talking about

246
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,560
Those of us in the cloud industry we keep talking about

247
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,890
That it's some future date

248
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,570
Compute will be the fifth utility

249
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,280
behind water and electricity and

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,360
So

251
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,320
You don't have to spend much time with containers

252
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,650
To go. Oh, I see how that's gonna be possible

253
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,330
containers

254
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:30,050
They just work and they just do the calculation that you want them to do

255
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,880
Right and it's just like whoa. I didn't have to configure crap

256
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,200
I didn't have to yell at IT for rebooting my container. I didn't have to do any of this

257
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,980
No, like it's just friggin fantastic

258
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,140
From a platform side and from a developer side. I will say

259
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,500
That does create problems for us in the cloud industry

260
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Because we have this sort of generic

261
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,120
compute interface at the top, but yeah underneath it it's running on different pieces of hardware and and

262
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,940
Each component and that hardware could be could be

263
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,260
very different

264
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,380
Right. We have a new generation of hardware in Azure

265
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,990
And it took us months to realize that there was this one

266
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,990
memory chip vendor

267
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,830
who had

268
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,190
poorly manufactured it for us to figure out that that was what was causing these containers would

269
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,190
To reboot even though they shouldn't

270
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,190
Let me really back in to the customer. Yep. Ask another question. So

271
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,370
What if so testing is not the customer testing is not the customer and that

272
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,130
Above and beyond everything is what we want to get across

273
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:59,250
Okay, but but but but but but but but okay my I have a B2B business

274
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,490
So is whose mic so I'm meaning I business to business

275
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,010
I my software just for the listeners who may not have heard that acronym before

276
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,250
but so I'm making something for another business to do something with or and then they have a

277
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,170
customer

278
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,170
Who's like which one's my customer?

279
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,070
What are my choices?

280
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,790
this business I'm delivering software to or

281
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,390
maybe the

282
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,230
Is it who I'm delivering it to or the end customers? Like is it the end user?

283
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,920
like if I'm giving a

284
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,360
platform to some company and they're using it to build software for

285
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,240
Maybe their internal systems or maybe for an external customer

286
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,560
How does that work?

287
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,360
Who is who is my customer? How do I figure out who my customer actually is?

288
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:51,150
In a platform situation that can be challenged right because you when you're a platform foot. So for example

289
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,160
Unity I want to bring it up directly. I'll let you do it right unity is a

290
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:08,410
I'm sure you guys I think it's a little easier in our case my customer. Well for most of it the vast majority

291
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:15,890
This is actually a good question unity holistically our customer is the developer the developer making unity but not in every situation

292
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,840
You definitely have two customers. We do we do and in the B2B play you also definitely have two customers

293
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Right in the case of unity

294
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,950
Developers who want to design games

295
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,250
They don't have to go to unity

296
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:45,320
There are what five to ten major game engines out on the market

297
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,960
They don't have to go right your company. So what differentiates what differentiates is the capabilities and

298
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,920
Well, so there was a long experience could be capabilities and features or ease of use lots of things. Yeah in

299
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
one of the in one of the

300
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,400
Analyses I would do at your company is

301
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Go and look at okay

302
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:22,360
How do we grow the attach rate of of the developers on the unity platform? How do we once they once they try us out?

303
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,440
How do how do we get them to stay?

304
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,800
How do they get how do we get them to engage with us directly on on on feature requests?

305
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,240
This actually was the Microsoft play back in the 19 early 1990s. Sure

306
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,280
Right. Um, it was we got the developer we got the world

307
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,650
but the other aspect is as well is

308
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,410
These developers are building software

309
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,010
for end users and it's that end user where

310
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,290
Ultimately

311
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,510
Your guys's paycheck comes from correct. Well, I mean

312
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Yes, ultimately yes, but it's a you can draw a feed you could there's a nice feedback loop there

313
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,620
Yes, we need to enable our developer customers to give

314
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,540
Their customers something world

315
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,220
Value awesomeness and then that feedback comes to them and then comes by us

316
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,520
Do you can I can't draw it on a podcast but there's a nice little there's a nice little loop there, right?

317
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,260
If your platform has performance issues

318
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
So for example in

319
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,820
Or if our if our game engine components crash

320
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
right, you're not

321
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:50,060
You're basically going to be a platform that gets abandoned because the the developers who are using your platform

322
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,580
Can't make their customers happy. Correct? Correct. So in that particular case

323
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:02,710
The two sets of people who are your customer are your developers and are the developers of your platform in

324
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,310
True and I think it's gonna be the same for and the end their customers

325
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:13,110
They it's gonna be same for I would imagine that's the same for any sort of business to business type thing as well

326
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,710
any any place where it's essentially a platform component that's

327
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:23,310
Indirectly talking trying to think where it would be difficult to figure out who your customer is, right? But I

328
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,840
Honestly, if you can't figure out who your customer is if it's that difficult I

329
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,680
Think is a deeper problem there in your software company. I

330
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,860
Yeah, I think I can understand why it would be it could be difficult to get feedback from an end user

331
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
but here

332
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,190
But there are still ways right it

333
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,510
There so in a B2B play let's let's say

334
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:03,990
Actually, this was this was big news recently Walmart and Azure are joining hands

335
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,620
we

336
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,140
You could it's very easy to see

337
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,370
That

338
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,290
Walmart competes with Amazon in the retail space

339
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,970
Azure competes with Amazon on the cloud space

340
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:31,390
So does does Microsoft want Walmart to improve and and winning in their particular market you bet

341
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,590
Right now

342
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:43,030
That's probably the as far in the details on that particular topic. I can go into on any of these indirect things

343
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:51,180
On a platform you live and die on the ability of the people above you to satisfy their customers if you don't have direct customers

344
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,260
Now one of the things

345
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,140
That I've seen on the B2B discussion is oh no

346
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,380
So so some company comes down and leads on requirements

347
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,580
And I'm just gonna say anytime anyone delivers

348
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,630
requirements

349
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,150
You're better suited to treat those as hypotheses

350
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:19,230
Let's let me loop this back may need to deliver on those requirements because the contractual agreement. Let me just finish there

351
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,370
but

352
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,690
That's the bare minimum and you should be gathering

353
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,270
Whatever data you can if you think one of those requirements is baloney

354
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,630
You should be gathering whatever data you can and go back to that contract and say hey

355
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,150
We actually think our relationship is better going in this direction and here's our

356
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,030
information that back set up

357
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,030
One of the things I think can help

358
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:52,390
Someone a team practicing modern testing principles or someone leading the team in that direction to

359
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:58,510
Really nail this principle is to have those conversations around things like requirements talk about

360
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,230
Or ask what is the problem we're solving? Yes, and

361
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,430
From that requirement and may change from that. I think requirements end up being a lot versus

362
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,710
being a lot of want to versus need and

363
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,270
asking questions like

364
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,030
What problem are we solving will help will help vet that out?

365
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:22,510
There's a question our good old friend and sometimes listener Jim Moore used to ask all the time

366
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,670
But someone would would get come to him with some long request

367
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,990
Or some complex request something they wanted

368
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,510
He would follow up. This is a great question

369
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,720
So imagine you had all that what do you do with it?

370
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:41,680
And they give an answer and from that you can figure out what they really need and go. Okay. Could I just do this instead?

371
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,350
Oh, yeah, that'd be great and and you need a

372
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:53,230
Team following modern testing principles who embraces this principle are going to be very good at asking the questions

373
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,550
Whether they're around a requirement slash hypothesis

374
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,590
customer request from a forum for example

375
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,870
customers engaging online tend to be a

376
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:11,550
Just loud majority of your customers but not representative of all your customers. So you don't just want to make them happy you want to figure out

377
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,650
What customer problem can we solve so learning how to ask questions around?

378
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:26,110
Problems you're solving trying to understand need versus want can really help make your team excel at this principle

379
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,480
For sure. That's my brief little soapbox on this. Yeah

380
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:38,260
For me the best thing I have found is anytime someone has communicated

381
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,780
requirements

382
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:47,140
To me I will echo back the requirements, but I will use them

383
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,260
Okay, so what you're requesting from me

384
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:56,980
I will change it to the word requests in my communication back and then in my thought process

385
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,460
I view the word requirement and hypothesis as synonyms and

386
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:09,060
I find that that last aspect whether or not you do it publicly or doing it privately

387
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,780
I think that aspect is actually really

388
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
important

389
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,180
Because it'll it forces you to consider

390
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,500
That you may be doing work that does not achieve the ultimate goal and that

391
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,920
Goal is where all these precision questions that Alan just referred to come from

392
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,260
There are many times where I have been told what to do and in general that is because that's that's that

393
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,520
Individuals best gets as to what can be done

394
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,890
And I have found that more often than not

395
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,510
That if you can decompose that and figure out what it is that they need

396
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,990
Mm-hmm now sometimes

397
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:02,950
You'll do exactly okay. I get what you need and yeah, I can't think of a better way of doing this for sure for sure

398
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:10,430
In in my scenario with you know, they're coming to me to do it generally because I'm the knowledge expert. I

399
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,390
Know more things about this space than what they do

400
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:21,210
Which gives me the opportunity to go. No, I think actually what you need is this. How about if I do this instead?

401
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,050
what you end up doing when you really execute on this principle is

402
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:33,250
You solve customer problems in priority order like what's the biggest problem you understand

403
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,870
What's the biggest problem we can solve for our customers and you solve that you help that you help them solve that

404
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,070
and you move down the list so

405
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,150
It's as much about

406
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,370
Misdelivering quality

407
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,770
by or

408
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,330
delivering value to the customer by

409
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,130
Solving their most and most important problems first

410
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,280
Yes

411
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,480
Now let's talk about scorecards

412
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,060
No, let's not

413
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,860
Okay, fine. Let's talk about scorecards. Thank you. I know it's one of your least favorite topics

414
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,900
but I think it's I tell stories about why I hate them so much, but let me

415
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:17,010
But go I think I think we should talk about it right the the if we're saying the customer

416
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,290
so the controversy with this principle is

417
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,790
What is the definition of customer? Okay, and what we're saying?

418
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,690
It is a human who is taking a dependency on what you are

419
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,210
releasing and

420
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:41,770
That human is the one who's making a decision as to whether or not it is quality

421
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,960
Okay

422
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,320
So if you have a business to business

423
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,440
Contractual agreement that's not a human who's taking a dependency. That's a piece of paper

424
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,830
Now it may specify

425
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:02,550
Hypotheses around this and the maven specify legal consequences if you don't deliver on those hypotheses

426
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,390
But just recall that there's still a hypothesis

427
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:11,020
Now we could have a scorecard that says that we delivered on it. Okay now

428
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:21,750
So let's say you delivered a scorecard all green and it released to the wild and you're in this B2B scenario

429
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,130
You still run the risk

430
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,120
Because you delivered what that other business wanted instead of what they needed

431
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,470
You still run the risk that they pay you for your contract and then leave you

432
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:41,270
Sure, because and there are probably I didn't dig any out in advance

433
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:48,390
But anecdotally from my experience I can tell you this happens or happened frequently or not rarely

434
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:55,030
Not yeah, not really. I've seen this happen as have I

435
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:04,390
Trying to remember that stupid phone product Microsoft built Oh kin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was kin. Yeah

436
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,590
That was that was a required. It was essentially

437
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,520
Someone or some set of someones had this idea of

438
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
producing a a

439
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Hybrid dumb smartphone

440
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Yeah, right. It was smart enough phone, I guess. Yeah

441
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,080
It was where we could keep the price point super cheap and the target tweens sure that's talk about it was for right

442
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,290
This is a great example of building something that doesn't yeah building the wrong thing

443
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:44,520
Right now the if we were part of the business team and doing a retrospective on this

444
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,420
Right. We would want to go back and go. Okay. What could we if

445
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,300
We've now learned that the market doesn't want one of these things

446
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,880
Right. What could we have done earlier?

447
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,190
to come to the same conclusion

448
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:08,350
During that time and I ran the last test pass on kin. Yeah, I did not know

449
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,360
And you're still I didn't just flat out fire the whole team

450
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,610
That's why I ran the last test pass. Oh because we had

451
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,440
It was a special deal with Verizon

452
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,780
Verizon wanted had all of this hardware stock and they wanted to to sell it out

453
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,240
And so though yeah after yeah, so they changed they changed some of the software

454
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,760
To turn it into this is after I mean, this is a product that was out on the market for a week or two

455
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
And then just given up on

456
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,640
And I want to literally spit state. I literally ran the last test pass

457
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,360
I literally executed the very last set of test cases on this one and this was me as a back then

458
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,960
I was a test manager

459
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,060
But it was one of those things where I wasn't going to assign it to one of my ICs

460
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Not if I wanted to keep them on the team, but what a great example of just shipping the wrong thing

461
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,040
This is well and that's part of the the learning lessons here

462
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
Is

463
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,560
We did ship the wrong thing and we spent a lot of costs and if we had gone back and we had said

464
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,200
Okay, the customer is the only one qualified

465
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,280
to make a judgment call here, how can we

466
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,030
How can we test our?

467
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,030
Hypotheses here

468
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,030
Much sooner much. Yes

469
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:39,790
Yes, before going all in on this this is maybe the canonical example of field of dreams engineering

470
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,150
Yeah

471
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,670
now there was

472
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:48,830
We were in transition back in those times a lot of the lot of it was a very

473
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,110
predictive

474
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,990
software development

475
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:58,860
But that doesn't exist anymore. I know well now I did want to merge doesn't need to exist

476
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,220
I think that back we don't have the infrastructure requirements to force a

477
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:12,570
Get it right the first time when your delivery dates three years from now, right? That's just that's

478
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,250
Foolishness in today's market it is I was just gonna note that it's incredible that

479
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:24,750
After the failure of kin that Microsoft was able to turn things around to become a world-class phone business

480
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Yeah

481
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,470
Yeah, you know so I don't have any

482
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,670
Information here that's not

483
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,230
public knowledge I keep seeing news reports about

484
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,910
the surface phone

485
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,600
right, um

486
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:54,070
And I keep I'm curious about this this one because every time something else comes out. It still does not

487
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,140
claim

488
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
That the project's been abandoned

489
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,540
Right and the M. I'm curious about that is like, okay

490
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,540
so if we're not abandoning it are we going down some sort of intuitive route or

491
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,780
Have we learned from our our prior mistakes and there we leapfrogging?

492
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,200
And I really don't know. I don't know either

493
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,000
I did want to there was a little state if I don't think anyone on the business team listens to the podcast

494
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,080
But pretty sure they don't if they do

495
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,760
Like if it doesn't directly contain say the Android app store or

496
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,260
The iPhone app store. Yeah, like what are you doing?

497
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,620
so I think we've made our point that

498
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:50,200
Absolutely customers important we as modern testers or people driving modern testing principles need to help our teams figure out

499
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,480
what customer problems were solving and

500
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,220
Drive the team in that direction and talk about some different ways we can do that

501
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,060
Anything else on this topic talk about asking the right questions prioritizing

502
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,900
Treating it as a hypothesis that that your work should prove or disprove

503
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,770
You can go with a negative aspect and say I'm not going to just trust the requirement

504
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,790
But you can also think of it from principle number one

505
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,790
Hey, so this requirement stock is a list of someone's

506
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,230
Hypotheses around how we can build a better business

507
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,640
principle number one

508
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
test is not just

509
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,340
Test is no longer just a cost

510
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:44,100
Reducer no, we're looking at we're also looking at how do we drive revenue?

511
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,740
Mm-hmm. All right

512
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,000
so with these hypotheses in play

513
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,480
Okay, and and with our knowledge of

514
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,200
What makes customer happy and what solves the customers problems?

515
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,150
What can we do to?

516
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:10,270
Prove or disprove these hypotheses and the ones that where we gain knowledge. What can we do to grow those?

517
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:16,160
The biggest aspect I think of modern testing is they shift to

518
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,520
being a

519
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:24,920
More active portion a more active participant in the business and are concerned

520
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
with growing that business

521
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,640
It's not about

522
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Preventing customer harm anymore

523
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:41,140
Certainly, that's important. It's about how do we if the customer is the only one qualified

524
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,060
to define if it's a

525
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,900
Quality software situation and the quality software situation as we covered here over and over and over again

526
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,640
Sometimes customers care about bugs. Sometimes they don't

527
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,240
They care about their problem solved. Correct. How do we how do we take that and

528
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,370
help the business

529
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,990
Grow faster. Yeah, I think its principles a lot about just

530
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,330
Re-emphasizing how important that customer prioritization is in order to make quality software

531
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,250
There's a there's a model a bunch of variations of this that show

532
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:27,050
The CEO at the bottom and then managers and then individual contributors who are making who are making a lot of decisions

533
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,210
And then on top of that the customer

534
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:35,160
Yeah, so the customer leads the way and being able to drive the team towards

535
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,720
recentering the team I guess would be a good way of putting it of

536
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:45,360
Continuously recentering the team around the importance of the customer and the importance of solving their problems

537
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,630
if there's anything around

538
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,030
This one that I would say we

539
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:58,040
The test community should walk away with is we are abjectly saying

540
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,070
No, an end user is

541
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,520
The single most important in an indirect situation

542
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,400
There may be other people's opinions that are important on if it's a quality but ultimately it's the end user who's benefiting from the

543
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
From whatever you're producing

544
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,770
your solution to a problem

545
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,400
number two test is

546
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,760
Absolutely not a

547
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:34,140
Representative of the customer they are not the customer. They should stop pretending to be one

548
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:43,030
For sure. I think we're good. So thanks again for listening. We'll dive into number six next time. I am still Alan

549
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:48,350
I think I think so too. All right great. Yeah, whatever. See you next time
