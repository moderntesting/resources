1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,900
Hey everybody, I'm Alan and Brent's not here.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,700
No, no, no, but even better, I'm here with three of the three.

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,500
Can you guys introduce yourselves?

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
Hey, my name is Michael Richards.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,180
I am the director of Quality Assurance at a software company that does software for

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,660
the commercial real estate industry.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,140
I'm Vernon Richards, no relation to Michael, and I am an independent tester from the UK.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,300
You guys look like brothers.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
And I'm Perzi Ababa.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,220
I am a test manager for a very big healthcare company.

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,220
Smith and Smith?

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,220
Yes, something like that.

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:59,520
Perzi also a contributor to our Mail Bash, which we don't have today.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,480
Hey, we are together because we're at Test Bash.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,840
Guys having a good time at Test Bash?

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Oh yeah, very good.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,720
In Philadelphia, my very first time to Philadelphia.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
How about you?

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,680
I came once when I was 15 with my mom.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,240
I haven't been back since.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,040
All right, anybody else been to Philadelphia before?

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Never.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
You live here.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,880
I live like 70 miles from here, but this is actually technically where I was born because

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,560
I came here in this country via Philadelphia, I don't know, 20, no, 17 years ago.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Wow.

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Yeah.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,950
My first time here, I've been to like 40 plus of the states, but I've never been

29
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,950
to Philadelphia.

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,630
Most of my state traveling when I was a younger lad.

31
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,750
If there's not a Microsoft office, I probably haven't been there.

32
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,270
If there's a Microsoft office, a big one with engineering, I've probably been there.

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,630
That means I've been to great places like Fargo, tourist destination.

34
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,630
Never been to North Dakota.

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,310
I've been to 45 of the 50, and that's not one.

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,310
I've never been to Maine.

37
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,270
That's just like a few miles away, right?

38
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,270
Let's drive right up.

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,270
No?

40
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,270
I've never been to Delaware.

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,270
Yeah, it's like 11 hours.

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,270
That's really a few miles away.

43
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,950
I've only ever been to New York, so this is my second state now.

44
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,950
You're not from the US?

45
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,950
No, I'm not.

46
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,270
I thought it was a Southern accent.

47
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,270
No.

48
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm not American.

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,760
You'll be surprised to hear.

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Yeah.

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,720
Oh, I'm a little jealous right now.

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,840
Do I need to leave?

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,720
This is day one, the end of day one of Test Bash, a two day single track event full

54
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
of some really cool talks.

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,200
I've been five for one, have been impressed.

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,880
When I go to the star conferences and Lee Copeland's going to listen to this and be

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,400
mad that there's so many tracks.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,720
The way I get value out of a conference like Star is I bounce around.

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Because this one isn't very good or not a great speaker, not well prepared.

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
From that, from my willingness to bounce around, and Lee actually encourages that.

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,960
I actually get good value here.

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,200
Conference like this, I was a little worried, single track event, but all the talks are

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
really good.

64
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,840
At least in my opinion.

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
I thought we could just go around and talk about our favorite Test Bash event and just

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,360
see where that goes.

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,320
My favorite was the last talk from Elizabeth, whose last name I forgotten.

68
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Zagroba.

69
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Zagroba.

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Zagroba.

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,120
And the reason I liked it is because I'm an introvert.

72
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,040
And let me, and I just got the WTF look from Vernon.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,400
Because she gets what being an introvert is.

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,960
People who are extroverts, people who don't actually think about who introverts are,

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,800
think of them as these people that just kind of, they're, think of them as recluses.

76
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,600
People that don't like to talk to people.

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,440
I can be friendly, I can give talks, I can try and be entertaining.

78
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,120
But it requires great effort from me.

79
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,840
So if I have a day full of meetings, or if I have to teach a workshop or even give a talk

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,520
tomorrow, I will be exhausted afterwards.

81
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,060
So introversion is, it's an internal preference, but what a lot of people don't realize, it's

82
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,980
really the effort that it requires.

83
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:12,180
I can act extroverted, but it requires me 10X the effort that it requires a extroverted

84
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,780
person who's naturally extroverted.

85
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,900
I can do it, I can play that game.

86
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,260
And you have to be successful in a career for this long and deal with people and not just,

87
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,300
and have a lot of opportunities I've had.

88
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,060
I've had to play the part of being a loud person, not just loud.

89
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,340
That is a bad, that's a bad stereotype on extroverts.

90
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,100
Again, extroverts aren't just the loud frat boys.

91
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,580
They're the people who, it requires energy from them to not talk to people.

92
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,060
If you're an extrovert, but I want to talk to them, I want to find out this, this, this,

93
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
and this.

94
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,860
And for them, it requires more energy to not do that.

95
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,140
For me, it requires the energy to actually get out there and have conversations.

96
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:01,040
The last question from Maura really nailed it for me, because I'm, well, I'm pretty sure

97
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm an extrovert with maybe introverted traits every once in a while.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,200
But the thing is, in order to find out if someone is an introvert, I have to bother them

99
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,320
or I need to interact with them to the point where they're going to have to now use some

100
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,240
energy to let me know how, and I don't really want to do that.

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,130
I kind of just want to be able to just identify somehow their introverts without bothering

102
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,260
them.

103
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,020
Yeah, so it's a bit of a catch 22.

104
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,220
I'm always surprised when people turn with it, like I gave you the face because I'm like,

105
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,340
what? I just I just cannot detect who is it until you make it.

106
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,820
I can't do it. Every last one of my friends who told me that introverted, I'm like,

107
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,260
start or be under all belief.

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,460
I can't believe it. I'm like, what? You?

109
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,780
Like, yeah, I just need to I just need to just tap out and get the hell out of here

110
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,820
and just recharge because I'm drained.

111
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,140
I'm dead.

112
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm always surprised by that because they always just seem to be always up.

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,620
Well, and with and with what Elizabeth said was really important that, you know,

114
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,620
it's it's not it's the preference.

115
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,300
It's exactly for her to do.

116
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,220
And, you know, I it's kind of interesting.

117
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,260
I don't know what I am. I don't know if I'm an extrovert or an introvert.

118
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,460
Under certain circumstances, I'm absolutely an introvert.

119
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,500
I feel the same alone.

120
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,060
Let me go do what I want to do.

121
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,340
And other times I'm very extroverted.

122
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,340
I was a radio DJ for eight years.

123
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,340
I just I learned how to be that way.

124
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,180
And I still kind of carry it to a certain extent.

125
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,420
But if I get into a situation where I have an extreme extrovert,

126
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm all I shut down. I'm gone.

127
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,580
I will shut off and that meeting is done.

128
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,700
I'm pretty sure Susan Cain has a TED Talk.

129
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,460
And if you haven't watched it, you should absolutely go and watch it.

130
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,460
It's really, really good.

131
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,700
Very insightful.

132
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,460
Yeah, and I can I can identify with what Michael is saying,

133
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,100
that whether you're an introvert or an extrovert,

134
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,140
it's not like a binary function that gets returned a value that you are this or that.

135
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,620
There's definitely a spectrum by which certain aspects

136
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,780
or certain parameters where you can be an extrovert.

137
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,420
I mean, I come from

138
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,680
the Philippines and Southeast Asia and the power distance index, for example,

139
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,360
which is the sense of how you deal with people who you think are your leaders

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,800
or your elders out here in the West.

141
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,340
You're being dealt as if you're a peer.

142
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,940
Right. So you can talk freely.

143
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,180
You can disagree freely.

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,260
At the end of the day, there's no harm, no harm, no foul, technically, technically.

145
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,620
But from my culture, it's hard for me to kind of talk over

146
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,220
someone who I know is either much older than me, who is my boss.

147
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,940
And it took me.

148
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,540
Well, I'm still dealing with it until now.

149
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,060
I've been in this country for 17 years now, and I'm still dealing with that

150
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,380
on a daily basis.

151
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,220
It gets worse as you see these

152
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,020
titles that go up and I'm in the same room as them.

153
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,180
I just clamped up.

154
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,340
So one thing that would have been

155
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,260
a good answer to one of the questions Elizabeth was asked around how can you

156
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,300
recognize these things is there's a lot of good books and some bad books,

157
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,620
but some writing, at least on this idea of emotional quotient,

158
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,100
which is a lot of people look at that EQ is like making sure

159
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,330
you're not being a dick.

160
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,410
But there's a lot to it.

161
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,170
It's recognizing how you're coming across and how you're being interpreted

162
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,570
sort of in real time as you're having a conversation

163
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,890
and recognizing that people with different whether it's a cultural background

164
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,570
or introversion, extroversion, the way they're reacting, the way they're

165
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,730
taking part in that conversation and recognizing in real time how it's both

166
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,290
influenced by what you're saying and everybody else's participation

167
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:44,410
is a skill that anyone with any sort of leadership or management would really

168
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,730
it's it's like one of the hardest things to do, but it's really, really important.

169
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,940
Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,380
All right.

171
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,740
Let's that was my favorite event so far.

172
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,660
We have tomorrow to go.

173
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,660
But but Vernon, what what has been your favorite event so far at Test Bash,

174
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,420
Philadelphia, 2016?

175
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,540
So it was also Elizabeth's talk, but also the scavenger hunt was pure genius.

176
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,620
That was so, so good.

177
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,620
So you talk a little bit about frame that for the three

178
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,980
that haven't heard about, oh, wait a minute.

179
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,700
If the three are here.

180
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,420
Who's the hell is going to listen to this podcast?

181
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,620
You know, it's going to be some other.

182
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,980
I know it's going to be it's the person who's not in this room fondly is Mike Stan.

183
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,340
The testacular one.

184
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,900
Brent, well, Mark might listen.

185
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,340
You're right.

186
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,540
So, yeah, the there's a scavenger.

187
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,020
So how this works was

188
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,420
one of the organizers, Richard Bradshaw, who's a friendly tester on Twitter,

189
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,460
set us a mission to go and explore Philadelphia.

190
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,860
And we had to go and find interesting things and make notes on them and return

191
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,260
and give that information to our product owner.

192
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,580
And he said, he didn't say product owner initially.

193
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,300
Did he? Oh, OK.

194
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
What he said was, here's here's the scavenger hunt.

195
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,380
Here's the parameters.

196
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,540
As far as the boundaries are concerned.

197
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,620
Here are the points of interest.

198
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Go.

199
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,900
Oh, OK. So it wasn't like a real interrupt.

200
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,420
It wasn't a real like a traditional scavenger hunt.

201
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,780
Because we didn't we were told where to go and not what to look for.

202
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,620
Exactly.

203
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,700
So there were some traps along the way that many of us blundered into.

204
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,900
And we had to come back and answer some questions

205
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,660
that we didn't know about in advance.

206
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,660
So we had to just go out, explore, like Alan said,

207
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,700
gather some information that we didn't know, whether it was the right information

208
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,700
to what degree of detail.

209
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,460
And then the questions came out an hour later and we had to

210
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,380
answer the questions and submit them by with a deadline.

211
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,820
And so it was very interesting how the different teams

212
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,780
captured all that, tackled that from really good, really, really good.

213
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,300
I think what's really interesting is is after the fact, when everyone came back

214
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,500
and you saw such a disparity in who really was able to think through

215
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,580
what this is really trying to teach us.

216
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,740
Yeah. And they went back to Richard and asked him, what's the goal here?

217
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Because so often we go just running out to test or to do whatever it is we do.

218
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,180
And we don't know what the outcome is supposed to be.

219
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,380
We don't know what the final goal is.

220
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,140
We don't have really the definition of done, if you will.

221
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,460
Yeah, it was it was very so it sounds completely random

222
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,780
and inappropriate for a software test and conference to do that.

223
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,820
But the parallels between like Michael was saying, our work

224
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,620
and the scavenger hunt were quite quite, you know.

225
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah, I thought it was a great event just from the perspective of

226
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,020
taking advantage of the venue.

227
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,860
Yeah. You couldn't tell from where we're at, like that we're so close

228
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,620
that we're at the Fringe Arts Theater in Philadelphia.

229
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,340
You can't tell that we are like a quarter mile from Betsy Ross's house.

230
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,620
Yeah. You walk up the hill.

231
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,420
It's like history.

232
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,580
Flaming in your face.

233
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,460
Big time history.

234
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,660
It's absolutely fantastic.

235
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,980
It's brilliant. And I've got a couple of testers on my team.

236
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,420
My entire team is here.

237
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,260
And I've got a couple.

238
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,540
In fact, the majority of my testers aren't even from the United States.

239
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,260
They're there for I've got one from Ukraine.

240
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,940
I've got a number from India.

241
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,940
And for them, this was a great history tour of the United States.

242
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,700
And they absolutely loved going to Independence Hall and seeing,

243
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,700
you know, where the Liberty Bell is, et cetera.

244
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,100
And they didn't realize it was really Liberty Bell.

245
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,380
It's not that big.

246
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,380
But but wait a minute.

247
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,660
I didn't make it to Liberty Bell.

248
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,300
I thought it was like six feet tall.

249
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,500
No, it's the same.

250
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,540
Yeah, I thought it was going to be some gigantic man sized thing.

251
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,140
That was really not as big as you think.

252
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,260
And so I was going home.

253
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,620
But I think I'm going to piggyback on what we're saying.

254
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,540
This is my favorite as well, because of the fact that it took an object lesson.

255
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,020
And Richard did an excellent job.

256
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,860
And he's even now worried that it didn't turn out the way he expected.

257
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,180
I think it nailed it in spades.

258
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,340
He nailed it.

259
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,220
And and the way in which it was done and how he followed up at the end

260
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,020
with the questions he asked and the end of the.

261
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,500
Yeah, he had to lead occasionally.

262
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,100
But by the same token, it worked out to the point where I don't know

263
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,180
that anyone's going to go away from this, not having this as an object

264
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,500
lesson in their in their pocket.

265
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,100
And shout out to Martin Hinnier as well.

266
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,380
For doing a standing job is a terrible product owner.

267
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,340
And does anyone else find it interesting?

268
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,140
I mean, I guess you're from that country, too.

269
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,140
What's it called? The UK? UK. Yeah.

270
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
No, no, no. The country, the country is England.

271
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,980
I think you're correct.

272
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,780
It's sad that probably 20 percent of Americans can figure that out.

273
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,980
OK, where was I?

274
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,260
Oh, we have the foreigners, the foreigners coming to America.

275
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,020
As of two days ago, it's pronounced America.

276
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,780
Coming to America and giving us and then setting up a scavenger hunt

277
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,500
of historic American sites. Amazing.

278
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,400
Yeah, I'm going to piggyback on that, too, because that's really where

279
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
like one of the stuff that was pretty interesting.

280
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,040
It was I was in a group where mostly are like the people that are in my team.

281
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,320
So we're a very freshly set up team.

282
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,280
And our boss was even in that the disadvantage that I saw in that, though,

283
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,600
it was interesting that it was disadvantageous because my boss grew up in this area.

284
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
So he ended up being our tour guide.

285
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,160
So he had so much background history that he started talking about,

286
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,200
you know, what are the other stuff that kind of happened here?

287
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,720
Like, for example, the Christchurch burial site

288
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,520
where Benjamin Franklin was buried, there's actually four other

289
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,520
original signers of the declaration of dependence that were also buried there.

290
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,640
So he had all these like tidbits that he was, you know,

291
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,040
telling us while we were going through.

292
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,150
But the problem is we I would completely blame him.

293
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,910
He actually follows our podcast.

294
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,070
But our podcast, our podcast, our sorry.

295
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,190
This is what happens when Brent is not here.

296
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,190
He's been usurped.

297
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,910
Is that when when you're actually in a testing team

298
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,830
and you have someone who is sort of an expert, they kind of lead you towards

299
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,990
other avenues where he thinks it's important

300
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,870
instead of giving you the chance to be able to, you know, look around

301
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,510
and look at those opportunities where you can actually dig for stuff

302
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,620
that you find interesting.

303
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,060
And I think for me, that was the one thing that kind of

304
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,430
was front and center.

305
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,870
And then after towards the middle of that

306
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,070
exercise, we just started ignoring everything that

307
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,790
the Ministry of Testing were tweeting about.

308
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,790
Because we were just engaged and was just looking around

309
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,350
and just did not care about the product at all.

310
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,430
It's funny, because the after that, because I was in the same team as Alan,

311
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,190
but the sub team, because we split up into sub teams

312
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,510
that I was on, there were two Philadelphians on the team,

313
00:15:53,030 --> 00:16:00,080
but they hadn't really engaged with the history of the city.

314
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,200
So it was it was it wasn't the same as the experience that you have.

315
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,760
There is a fantastic parallel there, though.

316
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,570
How many times have you been working like you, whether it's a tester,

317
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,740
developer, using an app that you've used before these for a long time

318
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,380
and they just get they're just so comfortable sort of working around it

319
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,700
and working within its its glitches and things that new set of eyes come in

320
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,820
and you go, well, why does it do that? Do what?

321
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,180
That? Oh, crap. That's a bug.

322
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,980
Yeah.

323
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,980
It's the same thing if the native going, and this is this is what is that?

324
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,140
I never looked at that before. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting.

325
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,500
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

326
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,940
Hello, Georgia and Mike.

327
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,500
I don't know if you listen to this, but yeah, they they there were some bits

328
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,260
that they really knew, but there was a lot of it.

329
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,820
Oh, I didn't know that was here. No.

330
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,660
OK, I forgot about that.

331
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,740
And this even the the venue that we're in now

332
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,310
is has history that Mark was telling me about.

333
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,990
So I was sharing the history of this building with Georgia

334
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,790
and Mike and they were like, what?

335
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,310
I didn't even know I didn't even know that was that was the thing.

336
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,710
So so yeah, that was that was pretty cool.

337
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I think ultimately the the takeaway from from that specific experience

338
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,040
comes down to looking at things in a different way and making sure

339
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,010
you know, from taking it back to a testing aspect where our jobs are

340
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,850
basically to provide quality no matter where it comes from, no matter what avenue.

341
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,290
And if it comes from a tweet, if it comes from which is how ministry of testing

342
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,290
chose to provide us with some of the details of how the product is supposed to be

343
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,950
and realizing that we don't always we have to talk to people.

344
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,870
We have to ask the right questions.

345
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,150
We have to talk to the product owners.

346
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,310
We have to provide that information back to our teams

347
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,400
and to the developers.

348
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,680
And however we go about doing that, that's our job.

349
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,840
And and that's what I think was really cool about it.

350
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,760
Hmm. Cool.

351
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,800
Any other highlights from the day you want to mention?

352
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,670
I think Nancy Kellins talk.

353
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,470
I wanted to talk about it, but I want to hear your take first.

354
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:15,450
It's it's pretty ironic for me in a sense that she was talking about context

355
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,170
driven testing, but then she realized that there's some times where we can be

356
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,250
very imperialistic about like we can we can be very imperious about how we

357
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,770
employ context driven testing.

358
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,900
I thought what she did was 100 percent pure unadulterated context driven testing.

359
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,740
Like it was it was like, what is going to what is my problem and what

360
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,540
what is the best solution right now?

361
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,900
And that's the thing that I'm going to do.

362
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,220
I I I found it interesting that

363
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,260
I interpret what she was saying as I ended up not doing context driven

364
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,660
testing because of the context, right?

365
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,700
Because of the context.

366
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,260
And I was like, you just did one.

367
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,980
You you couldn't have done any.

368
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,660
It couldn't have been any more context driven.

369
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,180
Right. That that realization really for me was was the big key.

370
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,260
Right. That she had to go through that experiment, realize that it didn't work

371
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,130
and then step back and said, no, this does not work for this particular situation.

372
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,250
Like it did work.

373
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,570
I went into a talk.

374
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,770
I mean, I looked at the title.

375
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,890
I thought, ah, crap.

376
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,930
Somebody else spouting off about CDT.

377
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,730
And my stance is testing.

378
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,850
If you're doing it right, it's context driven by definition.

379
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,690
You have if you're not otherwise, you're preaching to the choir

380
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,410
because anyone coming to a conference like this, not going, I love writing

381
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,290
test cases and actually, I'm going to go to a conference and learn more about that.

382
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,690
No, it's so I was pleasantly surprised.

383
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,010
I don't I'm I'm a little burned out on the where I'm a context driven tester.

384
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,770
And I think if you're doing as any sort of coach consultant,

385
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,050
and my line is all knowledge work, all good knowledge work is context driven.

386
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,930
So I went in there with like my bit flipped a little bit already.

387
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:07,690
But she gave a fantastic talk that talked about problem solving and organizations.

388
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,370
You call that talk problem solving and organizations to me.

389
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,210
I mean, I get why it was titled that and why it works.

390
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,210
I'm not nothing against it for that.

391
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:21,610
But it was a dang good talk talking about I go in, I recognize the problems.

392
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,570
I don't try and change everything at once.

393
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,460
It's boiled frogs. You change what you can.

394
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,420
Her story about now I got to remember, I remember like what it echoed in my head.

395
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,300
But there was some story about.

396
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,260
Oh, no, it was somebody else.

397
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,780
I'm going to change topics because I'm already this is the way A.B.

398
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,020
testing tangent.

399
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,540
You have a tangent.

400
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,820
I forget who someone was talking about.

401
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,140
Oh, it was the talk before Elizabeth Christina.

402
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,260
She mentioned that this team wanted to do BDD, but the director said,

403
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,580
no, you cannot do BDD.

404
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,460
She goes, I'm going to do BDD anyway.

405
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm going to tell you.

406
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,260
They remind me of my very first day at Microsoft when I was handed

407
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,860
this list of test cases and printed out Excel spreadsheet

408
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,920
and managed my manager gave them to me and I said, OK, I got it.

409
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,720
When do you need these automated by?

410
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,920
He goes, oh, no, we don't have time to automate.

411
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,280
I just need you to run these every day.

412
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,320
So that was a Monday.

413
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,950
I had them automated by Thursday.

414
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:33,470
So it kind of like that is a great skill that, again, a knowledge worker

415
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,430
should have to know, OK, I know what you said and I know why you said it,

416
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,020
but it's not right.

417
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,380
So I'm going to do the right thing for you.

418
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,060
Great example. Give them what they need versus what they want.

419
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,980
That's what I was going to say.

420
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,500
Understanding what, what, what, what's driving this request

421
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,860
and then can I can I meet that need?

422
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,620
Can I scratch that itch?

423
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,300
That's another part of emotional quotient.

424
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,300
One of the talked about a minute ago, it's realizing when you say something

425
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,380
that I think is dumber than crap, there's a reason for that.

426
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
I think I know you're a smart guy.

427
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,820
There's a reason you said that. Exactly.

428
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,780
And then as much real time as I can figure out where you're coming from.

429
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,380
So I can interpret and ask you the right precision or probing question

430
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,380
and then actually give you what you need.

431
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,740
Is that a new word?

432
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,100
What's that? Interpret, interpret.

433
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Is now.

434
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,220
New word.

435
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,420
I don't know. I don't know the sound effect for that.

436
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,220
I really liked Christina's talk.

437
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,100
I'm actually in charge of the change management for the engineering

438
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,020
and product teams at my company.

439
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,780
And so, you know, I'm a communicator by nature.

440
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,110
And so it's it's we're going through this period now.

441
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,670
Two years ago, we had to move buildings very, very quickly.

442
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,870
We had a very short time frame because a building that we were in,

443
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,550
the company sold it.

444
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,710
And so we had to move within 30 days to a new location.

445
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,190
It was complete chaos.

446
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,310
But the space that we found is some is a space that everyone loves.

447
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,870
It's open. It's, you know, all the stuff that people love about an old

448
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,350
building in the middle of downtown.

449
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,990
Anyway, now we're having to move again.

450
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,430
And this one is being done

451
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,420
for lack of a better term.

452
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,460
Really, really not well.

453
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm going to try and frame this well, because

454
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,460
they've known since August and it's slowly they've not talked to people about it.

455
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,300
They haven't engaged anyone about it.

456
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,660
And suddenly out of the blue, oh, by the way, we're going to move.

457
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,500
This is where we're going to move.

458
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,420
This is when we're going to move.

459
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,530
And the lease still isn't signed today

460
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,250
and we're supposed to move at the end of December.

461
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,820
So everything you shouldn't do in change management is going on here.

462
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,020
And everything you should do is being left aside.

463
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,140
And so the her talk was really good in terms of framing

464
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,660
how it is that you really need to approach change management,

465
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,300
specifically the most important one being time.

466
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,060
You have to give people time to accept what it is.

467
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,900
And the thing that I took is is sometimes when we make changes,

468
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,220
the best thing not to do, the best thing to do is to not make the change

469
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,500
if it isn't going to work.

470
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,180
She didn't say that in the talk, but but there was a very much implied

471
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,180
state there that sometimes change for change is not the best course of action.

472
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,140
Right. One of the things that stood out were

473
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,700
Lynette's slides.

474
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,660
The pictures of the cats were outstanding.

475
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,660
Some of the best collection of cat photos I was.

476
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Yeah, fantastic.

477
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,420
We cannot do justice at all to in a podcast.

478
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,180
No. So go and find that slide deck somewhere and just just revolve.

479
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,020
It's really hard to find the right cats, the right slide

480
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,260
and the right topic there.

481
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,660
Who knew cats were so expressive?

482
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,420
That's what that's what I'm going to say.

483
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,500
I just thought they were their cats.

484
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,060
I don't know.

485
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,260
They could be.

486
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,980
Could all be her.

487
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,860
They could be performance.

488
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,420
If they're all hers, she's got a lot of cats.

489
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,020
She's got a lot of cats. Yeah.

490
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,380
I should talk to Mark Tomlinson, also one of the three,

491
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,260
because we have if nothing else, we have made a great advertisement

492
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,780
for next year's Test Bash.

493
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,980
Totally. So far so good.

494
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,100
So tomorrow's my talk.

495
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,180
So it could be a little shaky as I make a hand motion.

496
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,500
No one can see.

497
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,060
But if it's anything, if the day is anything,

498
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,180
hopefully the talks tomorrow are as good as today's.

499
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,740
And no one will notice if I take it.

500
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,420
No, it'll be good.

501
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,700
Don't worry. You have at least three or four hecklers.

502
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,580
All right. We'll throw things.

503
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,540
That's awesome. That's awesome.
