00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:09.290
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.510
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.030
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.140
Now on with the show.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.140
Hey everybody.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.140
It's Alan.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.570
It's Brent, mostly the anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.250
That's really, that's kind of the story here.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.210
We're not a great podcast, but we're a fun podcast.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.070
Yeah.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.150
You know, I miss the days where it was literally, well, we only did it a couple of times, the

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.150
vodka episodes.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.150
Not the vodka.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
Oh, those are fun too.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.810
And every time I open Riverside, I look at the live streaming option.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.930
I think, you know, we should just, no, we shouldn't.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.130
So we always can though.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.970
We can't, but those shouldn't involve drinking.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.490
So anything before I get into my story here and why I'm just freaking delirious today and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.950
not in a good way.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.010
Anything new, exciting with you need to share?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.260
I think last time I had just recovered from COVID.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.700
No, no, really good.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.180
So I did the opposite of had COVID I did for, I did this last year.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.180
You'll remember as well.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.780
I'll probably write a blog post about it again tomorrow, but I just finished walking

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.740
around Mount Rainier again.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.740
Okay.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.480
I took seven days to walk 95 miles around a big freaking mountain, which is fun.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.380
So anyway, let me just get all the way to the end.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.380
I do that.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.060
I have, was it snowy at the level you were at?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.060
I assume not.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.060
No, no.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.580
The highest point of the trail is about 6,600 feet, 6,800 feet.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.660
And that was, I could see there, there was snow around me that on the trail.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.580
Anyway, I did this trail seven days.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.580
It's kind of fast.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.220
I had a couple of big days in there.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.220
I get to the last day.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.220
I start with a big climb.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.220
The weather is beautiful.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.380
I have great pictures.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.380
I'm cruising along.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.820
This is the last day.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.420
I'm feeling good.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.860
I have breakfast, kind of a late, I like to walk like four or five miles before I eat.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.800
And I had breakfast and then I said, I'm going to the car.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.840
And I booked, I walked seven miles without stopping at all.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.820
Except for a couple of places, I had a little drink of water and I just booked it.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.900
And I get into the parking lot and there's nobody there cheering for me, but I'm cheering

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.900
for myself.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.900
Yay.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.160
And I walk over to my car and I can't get in because it is completely dead so much.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.500
I can't even get the key fob to unlock the door.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.840
Oh, someone left their lights on?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.720
No, it's just a, it's, I, time to upgrade someone's car.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.440
Time to upgrade someone's 12 volt battery in their car for sure.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.240
So anyway, that was a little.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.880
So I ended up not even making it home last night, but getting home early this morning.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.760
When, when, when was the, the, oh crap, my car screwed.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760
What time did that occur?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.840
Well, I got to the parking lot at two and it took me.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.840
PM.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840
PM.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
Okay.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.160
And it took me a couple hours to get to the, I can't get out of this.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.240
This won't, this won't jumpstart.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.920
This won't nothing.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.680
And yeah, but anyway, I'm just, it's great.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680
The hike was great.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.440
I have to get rid of the gray cloud over it.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.440
I'm working on that.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.670
So by the way, and I'll leave this part in the podcast with my phone rings.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.910
I have to answer it because I have a couple of calls in to get it fixed because it's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.550
still, my car is still way the F out in the mountains and I have to go rescue it.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.470
How the hell did you get home?

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.390
Mrs. Weasel came and picked me up.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.390
I see.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.480
Okay.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
So yeah, so that happens.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400
I'm a little tired.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400
So yeah, yeah.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.680
And then that's it.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.330
And then today I spent the entire day as one does when they take a week off, catching

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:16.010
up on messages in Slack and Teams and email because why have one solid and effective communication

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.070
platform when you can have three mediocre methods to choose from?

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.070
Okay.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.070
You just pause there.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.070
I'm sure it picked up fine, but I had no idea what you just said.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.950
It'll be in the recording.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.950
Don't worry.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.150
I was making a crack around too many methods of communication.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.350
Ah, yeah.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.670
So that's an excellent point, Alan.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.670
Yes.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.670
Yes.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.950
Speaking of excellent points, have you played with, and I had both my boss at work and

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:58.790
Jason Arbin had awaiting pings for me today asking if I've played with notebook LM.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.310
Have you played with notebook LM yet?

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.540
No.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.180
So we're going to go into the AI portion here.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.820
I brand had to ask some topics.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.640
So let me just, before you go dive in there, before you go dive in there, let me see

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.220
if I can play something for you, if I can find it here.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.680
I'll just cut to the middle here if I can.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840
Okay.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.080
So are you ready to dive into something kind of controversial today?

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.960
Always up for a good debate, especially when it comes to the ever-changing world of software

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960
development.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960
Right.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.640
And this one is a hot button issue.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.720
The idea that maybe we don't need dedicated software testers anymore.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.720
Yeah.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.120
That's definitely a statement that's going to ruffle some feathers.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120
You got that right.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.160
And the person shaking things up is Alan Page.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Oh yeah.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.480
I know Alan very well respected in the testing world.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480
Yeah.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.960
You could say he wrote the book on it literally.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.360
We're looking at a couple of his articles where he really throws down the gauntlet

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.360
claiming that most software teams don't need dedicated testers anymore.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.880
Interesting.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.800
And that most stood out to me too, because he's not saying all teams, right?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.200
Yeah. And that's an important distinction right off the bat, because he's

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.240
acknowledging that there are always going to be exceptions.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
Like what?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.480
I'm going to stop there.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.360
And this incredible podcast you've been listening to was generated by Notebook

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.880
LM by me feeding it two of my blog posts.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.880
Holy crap.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.120
I mean, I'm fascinated.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.270
So I did it with some, you know, very few of my posts are about testing, but I

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.270
want to bring that up in context of today.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.550
And just like, oh, well, that's interesting.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.950
So, um, I gave it, I did feed it all the rest of my blog posts and I

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.110
asked it a couple of questions here.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.030
And it's actually kind of interesting.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.070
It's only based on.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.710
You make like a notebook, like a Jupiter notebook.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.870
And it, oh my God, I'm just kind of blown away by it.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.270
So I asked it, I gave it all my blog posts and I asked two questions.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.840
Question number one, why do managers suck?

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.730
I won't read the whole thing, but it's, um, you know, it, it, it's, you

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.450
know, it's like the answers are written by me, uh, micromanagement and failure

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.490
to delegate lack of focus on people and engagement.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.970
And that's my big one ineffective communication and lack of clarity,

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.570
failure to adapt and embrace change, toxic behaviors and lack of accountability.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.690
I mean, those are, I mean, you know, those are me, but those are pretty good answers too.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.370
I was there all tried and true.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.690
So I said, what attributes to the best managers have, I haven't looked at the

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.890
answer yet, so we just come up here.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.410
Okay.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.850
They prioritize employee engagement and wellbeing.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.170
They trust their teams and empower them to make decisions.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.530
They are strong communicators and promote transparency.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.490
And they cultivate a culture of learning and continuous improvement.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.130
Again, great answers again, all, all based on me.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.810
So of course I'm going to like them, but, uh, it's, there's a whole bunch of

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:05.250
texts below that, that goes in there, but oh my God, the, what it can do.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.640
Already is kind of scaring me.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.000
This, uh, the idea that I could create auto create a whole series of blog posts.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.160
Like I have, you know, I've, I've written 80 articles on anger weasel.substack.com.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
Now, uh, I could have 80 blog posts.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.100
It would be funny if I did that, those AI generated ones and they got more

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.580
listeners than AB testing did.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:41.160
I, I don't, not only do I not think it's funny, I think it's reasonable.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.670
And I'm like, you know, that would save an hour of my time every two weeks.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.110
Right.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.630
We get a little deeper and they're a little too, you know, chat GPT is a little

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.790
too positive and always knows the right answer.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.830
I think the, the, this does the same thing in a way.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.310
It's a little too, I need it to not be me.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.350
I need it to be influenced by me.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:06.830
Well, yeah.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.390
But like the, when you played, when you played the two characters, right?

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.310
I'm still thinking about, about the, the one like, like, Oh yeah.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.270
I know Alan.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.030
He, he literally wrote the, like, like the way they phrase it.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:27.070
So much about me, but the thing that they phrased it was sort of like, um,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.950
it came across like, um, a vague recollection, right?

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.870
Wasn't he the guy that literally wrote the book on testing?

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.150
Like, I'm like, okay.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:37.910
Yeah.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.310
Someone who doesn't know Alan might do that.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.470
And immediately thought of like, yeah.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.310
Whitaker would probably argue about that.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:54.560
So would Kainer, but you know, uh, but yeah, it took me, this is sort of the state

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.400
of affairs, right?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.720
It took me a little while, like literally maybe 10 seconds before you turned it off.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.120
I'm like, Oh, wait a minute.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.280
This is, this is AI generated audio.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.130
It's gotta be right.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.410
And, um, it's why it's wild though.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:13.930
Right.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.570
Yeah.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:21.140
And, and honestly, like there was something and I still can't put my finger on it.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.700
That was something that was odd that led me to believe it was AI generated.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.140
Right.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:26.300
Yeah.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.420
But we're really approaching uncanny Valley.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:29.700
Yeah.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.460
Yeah.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.730
I don't know what uncanny Valley is, but I'm going to perfectly agree.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.130
Uncanny Valley.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.370
It's from, I think it's from Valley of the dolls like in the 60s of book.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.170
It's where it's like, maybe I think it's something different now.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.750
Um, but it's, we're creeped out.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.950
Humans are creeped out.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.760
Like we can see androids that look very androidy, like in the movies and that's,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.480
that's fine.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.120
They could look exactly human like they do in some movies and that's fine.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.920
But when they're right on that line, it's, it's creepy.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.960
And they call that uncanny Valley where it's, it's kind of here where it's

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.240
like, this is, oh wait, this isn't real or is it real or is it not real?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:10.840
Right.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.680
Right.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:19.230
Um, yeah, like it's happening.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.510
It's happening.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.550
Yeah, we're getting there.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:28.900
I've, I've been, uh, uh, interviewing folks on, uh, for AI, for some AI related

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.780
positions at, at, at current job, not in my org, but it's interesting.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.140
The folks I talked to, they get it.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:40.220
They get like, is a weird, we're going to go onto some of your topics, but

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.120
what I've noticed is, uh, and the reason I brought this up again, lack of

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.360
sleep, uh, AI isn't magic.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:57.080
AI today isn't even really AI and people want it to be magic and they want it

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.880
to be real AI and I think there are a set of realists who kind of get it.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.840
Who know what it can do, what problems it can solve, what problems it can't solve.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.960
So I've been talking to a few of those folks, uh, as well.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.270
Um, anyway, uh,

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.950
AI can solve everything.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.910
It can't solve hardly anything.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.390
So, uh, here's what I would like to do.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.280
I would like, I think you had a couple topics you were going to bring up,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.880
which I think is better for you, for me to comment and you to give us the

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.160
topic ideas than for me to think of topics because I'm a little, a little

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.520
not at a hundred percent.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.470
Oh, okay.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:47.480
So the topic that this.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.560
Let's we, we probably, we've probably talked about this a bunch of times, but

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.320
let me, let me just phrase it this way.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:06.450
I've come to learn of, of certain organizations that when they went too

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.410
fast and got rid of tests, right?

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:15.410
Piggybacking off of your idea, uh, as per the, you know, the, the, the

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.770
snippet from the other podcasts you just played, right?

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:27.710
That, that test doesn't need or test, uh, test specialists aren't necessarily needed.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.320
Right.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:37.560
The, one of the things that was observed from this organization is they did that.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:44.600
They did not follow the advice, um, that maybe you and I have had around,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.000
Hey, be cautious here.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:55.100
Make, make the change carefully, uh, because you don't want to lose the knowledge.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:55.660
Right.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.440
Um, the advice I have most organizations have ignored anyway.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.640
Uh, the advice I have is if you want to do this, right.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.480
Right.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:12.290
Obviously to me, it's make your assets, your, your, your key go-to people.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:20.570
Cause I find teaching them how to design and code properly is for some odd reason,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:25.850
way harder than teaching people how that don't want to test how to test.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.200
Right.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.760
And so I often will, you know, I still stand by I've experienced it.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.320
If you're in this phase, right.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.760
My view focus on your assets.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.280
Cause I think they're your way forward.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.310
Well, I, I, hold on.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:48.080
Cause I was going to just go on from that, but you don't have, you don't have

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.120
Estet's in your org.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.920
No, no, no, I'm, I'm whining back.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.400
Oh, you're, you're back on how we made the transition.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.880
How we made the transition.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.080
Yeah.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.700
But now, but now there's a situation, um, where this organization also made that

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:10.140
transition a long time ago, managed to, to muddle through it.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:19.440
But now we have quote unquote, I'll call them generations of dev leadership, all

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:26.190
who, which never really understood test, never really understood agile, never

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.390
really understood TDD.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:37.480
And now you have sort of this, this culture of dysfunction, um, that we're

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:43.600
trying to unwind and the, the people that came and talked to me were like, yeah,

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.810
we are going to swing the pendulum all the way back to 1998.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.450
And they asked me this one question.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:53.730
Yeah.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.690
And I, and they did it this way.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.770
And I'm going to ask you, Alan.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:08.980
When was the last time you even saw a test plan last week?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.300
Did you really?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.360
Yeah.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.280
We make, I make, I make the devs write them.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:14.940
Oh, all right.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:15.700
Yeah.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.100
That wasn't my response.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.700
All right.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:25.180
My response was, uh, 2007.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.460
And I hope to keep that status.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.740
Well, it depends if you're talking about the, like some of those old big

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.220
tome test plans versus let's please have a strategy of how we're going to test

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220
this thing that we're building.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.420
That was the context.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:37.900
They want us.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.660
What do I consider?

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.100
They want to know 50 page piece of shit that no one reads.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.300
Well, uh, Microsoft has always been very good about swinging the pendulum hard.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:47.700
Right.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.740
Um, so I know, um, it could happen.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.140
It, I mean, but actually, but maybe less so now, maybe more other places.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.580
I think people freak out.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.500
Actually, I shouldn't even put Microsoft in there.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:06.360
The industry has been infatuated with swinging the pendulum hard as a reaction.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.030
And this is a common, be careful of that band date.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.430
It may be a turnip good thing.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:21.790
When people, when teams made the transition to not having dedicated testers, uh, you

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.390
know, I used to talk about this a lot.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:28.160
Like you can, you, if you don't have a plan, you're going to fail.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And the plan includes how do you get as Elizabeth Henderson used to say, how do

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.080
you get the development team test infected?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.120
How do you get them?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.920
And now you get them to take testing seriously.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.680
And the way I did it, my first couple of teams, as we eliminated the role was a

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.080
lot of coaching and mentoring and teaching devs how to test, giving them

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.800
permission to test, making them feel like they knew what testing, what testing

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.080
was, and they could do it without some dedicated, uh, person to help them.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:07.150
And as Brent's looking up by, he's actually probably AI generating

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.670
his response while I talk here.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:18.630
So if you never had someone to teach developers more about testing that

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.990
you're not going to get free for, they have to have at least some ideas.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.830
And it's funny.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:29.690
It reminds me, uh, many, many, many years ago, someone asked me about this

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.090
exact situation, like what happened?

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.450
That's like, it's the quality culture maturity guide.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.090
Let's say you get to this level where of team owned quality and the

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.650
developers get testing and there's, and there's good testing in place.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:47.920
And, and, uh, the culture is correct for that to happen.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.240
But how do you maintain that?

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:57.680
Say the coach leaves, uh, how do you need the developers to now become

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.480
the coaches for the other developers?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.360
And when that begins to fail, you end up with a bunch of developers who

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.160
have never been given any idea how to test and they don't, and again, it's

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.880
not, oh shit, here's more controversy.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.280
It's not like testing's hard, but it's, it's, it's, it is.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:28.290
And I put it this way, coding's not hard either, but it's the ability to go low

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.490
level heads down, figure how to implement this thing and then step out

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.850
the 10,000 feet and ask yourself, does it work in which ways will this not work?

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:44.610
Let me, let me write some more code to evaluate my hypothesis on whether

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.810
this works and which ways it won't work.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:52.090
And it's just getting used to that workflow, which is different.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:56.690
It's different from when you're building a application in college for your professor

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.930
versus you're building an application at a company for 10,000, 100,000 million users.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.810
Um, before you go on, I want to, I want to, um, see if I can with my best voice

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.090
impressions, act out a little bit of a skit on this very topic.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.130
It needs to feel like they own quality.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.010
Absolutely.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.530
It can't be a one person job.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.250
It's got to be baked into the DNA of how the entire organization operates from

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.170
the product managers to the developers, to the folks in operations.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:21.490
Everyone has a role to play.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.050
Okay.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.290
So we're painting this picture of a more collaborative data driven way of building

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.330
software and getting away from this codependent relationship.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.930
What are some practical things teams can do to make that shift happen?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.450
Well, for starters, it's about embracing that coaching mentality.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.890
Yeah.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:42.330
We can't just expect developers to magically transform into testing experts overnight.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.730
Right.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.050
It's like any skill you don't become a master chef just by reading a cookbook.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.010
You need somebody to show you the ropes, teach you the techniques, help

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.690
you troubleshoot when things go wrong.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.770
Couldn't have said it better myself.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:54.130
Yeah.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.900
So I'm just like, you know what?

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.740
We should just do the podcast and then transcript it and then feed it to these

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.620
two, please suck.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:10.540
You know what?

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.300
I bet you even by today, there are podcasts posted with these

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.460
two talking about something.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.340
Oh, I'm sure somebody's way ahead of my idea.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.900
So I'm going to wait till there's more voices out there.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:27.490
But anyway, it, I, I listened to the whole, it's a nine minute podcast they

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.010
made based on my testing articles, but I knew there are some stuff about

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.450
this somewhere and I literally dropped the needle and that's what we got.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.130
So let me, let me ask you this.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.690
So the answer is not.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.450
If you're the answer is not to swing the pendulum, go back to night 1992

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.600
and, uh, create a one to one test to dev ratio.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.720
Not the right answer.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.360
No.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.760
What advice would you give a team who comes?

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.830
I mean, they come to you, they came to you with a solution, not a problem.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.350
They came to you with a solution to say here, we don't understand our problem,

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.590
but the solution is we should have a full test team.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.990
What do you say to them?

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:19.970
I, um, well, so a full test team, I would go like that's, um, dumb, dumb,

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:25.010
asinine, idiotic, I would do all sorts of adjectives along those lines.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.690
Right.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.050
The, um, I'll tell you what I did tell these folks.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:37.510
Um, so when people come in and ask me these type of questions, like my answer

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.630
is often in the strategic realm because I'm like, okay, what are the two key

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:47.310
things that are two or three, the small number of simple key things as a

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:52.070
strategy that they can execute that would generate the self-sustaining momentum.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.050
Right.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.450
For me, it's, it's right.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.050
The, the strategy around, oh, let's teach.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.210
Right.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.170
Even if it, even if that happened at the beginning, you're exactly right.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.290
If it doesn't continue, then you get new people coming in because

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.480
this is still not a topic that's really trained in college.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.480
Right.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.440
So you, and if you let that happen a couple generations, even if it is

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.880
trained in college, right, they'll come in and their manager was like,

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.680
what are you doing?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.960
Why do you, why are you spending all your time running this test code?

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.520
Just ship it.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.280
Right.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.000
I don't know if that's what they do, but yeah.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.320
Right.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:38.670
For me, I'm like, look, for me, it was when they came to me, I said,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:44.590
look, there are two practices that, that I would encourage you guys to

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.270
implement immediately.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:51.070
Everything else will come as a result of these two practices.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.750
This is from my experience.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.800
Number one, immediately implement and require TDD.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:08.760
Number two, instead of creating practices that, um, go back to the

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:15.500
prevention model, go the, um, essentially go the opposite direction.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.340
Instead of like creating practices where you deploy once every 10 months,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:29.380
go the other way, deploy 10 times a day, because doing that successfully

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.580
requires the correct amount of testing, the correct amount of muscle memory.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.380
Uh, and it then becomes a lot easier, small batch.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:38.900
Yeah.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.860
And I can build on two points in there.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.820
First is, and I kind of hinted at it in my setup for the question.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.900
I like to remind people, it says it doesn't, it doesn't surprise me.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.660
They came with a solution without understanding the problem, ask them

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.740
what problems they're solving because they may not even know.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.360
And, and that, and there's a reason I bring that up, not because it's, I

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.120
wanted to poop on the rest of your answer.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.920
It's because it's a, it's a stepping stone of critical thinking and testing

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.320
in large part is just critical thinking, looking at things from different

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.600
ways, looking at your things, critical thinking, or looking at your

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.840
application from different directions to understand in what scenarios

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.520
and situations will it work and not work, developing hypotheses around that.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.120
And then implementing more code to help you understand if necessary or telemetry

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.240
to help you understand those hypotheses.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.040
So understand the problem, dive in there.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.880
You can't just say, I know you, I know you didn't mean it.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.160
This way, we can just say implement TDD because if I just tell a dev dev team

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.600
or a developer to go do TDD, they're probably going to do it in a really

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.600
dumb way just to satisfy the requirement of must do TDD, uh, what, and again,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.240
TDD, it, it really isn't about testing.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.600
It's about writing testable code and about, and, but it does handle the

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.200
critical thinking part of makes you think about how the code should

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.760
work before you write it.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.920
So you begin to think about code differently than just implementing

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.320
the thing over and over and over.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.920
Now, I think there's still more to it because as you and I have talked,

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.120
dev teams are 100% reliable for functional correctness, but I don't

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.720
think the limitation that that's the minimum bar, the minimum bar for a

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.080
dev team is to ensure functional correctness.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.330
They can do more.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:33.170
Yes.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.370
They can, they can do their own security testing.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.250
They can do their own performance testing.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:43.930
They can, if you want to hire me as a very highly paid consultant to help

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.930
help this team out, um, I'll get it.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.490
I'll see if I can get a moonlighting exception and add to my retirement

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.570
portfolio, but they may need a coach for a little while.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.530
Uh, but what I found, and I found this as you know, repeated for

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:03.300
everybody here for many, many hundreds of developers, uh, in

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:09.100
affecting them with the ability to test really well is far more common

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.500
than you might think, like in a team of example of a hundred developers,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.300
I'm going to, going to, uh, mentally merge some things here, but in

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.260
the team of a hundred developers, if I am giving them coaching and I,

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:26.060
and coaching is such an overblown word now too, if I'm helping them,

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.700
my goal is to help them become better testers.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:35.300
About 10 of those developers are going to be better testers than 95% of

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.140
the testers I know they just pick it up.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:37.660
They get it.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.820
They have the right, um, mental capacity, whether they've, you know,

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.540
just the way they think about things, they get it and they go, oh my

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.340
God, and they're, they're great.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:52.940
Um, another 50 or 50 of those are really, really good at it.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.700
Not, not, you know, phenomenal at that higher level, but they're,

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.940
they're good testers.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.260
The kind of testers that if you're a tester, you would always get,

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.460
you could always find a job.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.170
The remaining 40 are going to, there's going to be 10 or 15 at the

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.490
bottom who just don't get it.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.970
And those are your low performers who probably get fired anyway,

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.570
because you can find, you can find developers who not only know how to

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.810
test, but want to test their own code.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.250
Well, just fire the shit heads and hire those folks to be done with them.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.930
And then I left about 10 or 15 in the middle who are probably kind of

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.890
struggling a little bit, but they're coachable and fixable over time.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:31.050
And in general, I'm, I'm, I'm amalgating amp.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.370
Is that the word I'm combining in my head, a bunch of different teams I work with,

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.810
but they just need a little hand holding.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:44.050
And, you know, in the coaching, again, overused word, the coaching you give them

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.330
need to be, you need someone who can be adaptive.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.170
It can't be a very rote process.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.930
It's always, you need that bigger, critical thinking of what's

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.730
working, what's not working.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.250
Let's try this.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:53.810
Let's try that.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.490
Let's let's disappoint them.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.810
Lovely.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:59.690
Can absorb and help them understand that they are actually going back to feedback

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.250
loops, I'll shut up for a second here.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.330
They are actually faster.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:03.970
Yes.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:08.250
If they do more of their own testing and.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:14.930
Well, and again, this is why, and I agree with your comments on TDD, but not

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.890
only, like I said, not only should they, they, they do their own testing,

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.650
like accelerate, blah, blah, blah.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:27.130
See, see, you know, 70% of the last 100 podcasts we've done.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:27.930
Right.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:38.120
Um, the, but if they don't know how I absolutely believe, uh, the two key

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:42.160
things are TDD and small batch.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:42.960
Right.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.480
Yeah.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.320
And, and, and, and I agree with you that TDD isn't necessarily around covering,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.200
but it does, it does kind of kill two birds with one stone.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.560
It makes a better design, which, which not only makes it more testable, but,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:06.150
um, uh, the better design makes it a lot easier to add features to it later.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.870
Yeah.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:12.310
Um, the, but I think the, the second part of that, I'm going to interrupt

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.830
because the second part of that is more important and Brian Finster, I had

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.190
never really articulate like he had.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.950
And I use this all the time now.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:28.050
Do CD or figure out what will be involved to do continuous deployment, because

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:32.530
even that, even the thought experiment will help highlight everything

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.250
blocking you from doing CD.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:38.290
So if you go to a team that requests this and they say, uh, we want to

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.490
go hire a bunch of testers to solve a problem we don't understand.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:45.290
And their problem is once you dig in that, well, we're, we have a bunch of

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.810
bugs that are getting to customers.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.130
And so we need, we need more time to bake them in or whatever it is.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.610
Say what's, what's missing.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.410
If you need to do continuous deployment, we're going to need to have, you know,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.210
more tests, great.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.050
Why can't your developers read those tests?

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:03.250
As just anyway, do CD, even if you'd never ever do it, go through the process.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:09.070
I still, uh, yeah.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.470
Okay.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.590
Number one, you're right.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:16.470
Go through the process because that will probably inspire things that you

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:17.910
realize that you can do.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.190
You can't just say, no, we can't do CD.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.710
Right.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:30.320
The thing is you will never do CD if you do not ever start thinking

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.680
about how to do CD, right.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.400
In order to finish it, you have to start.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:41.440
So don't use, don't use your perception of it to avoid starting.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.520
Like it's sort of the same thing.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.160
I, I encountered with agile people, people like we

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.200
talked about it many times before and many years ago, like my hatred of the

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.600
manifesto, because people use it as a shortcut.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.640
They don't spend time thinking about it.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.920
Intellectual lazy kicks, kicks in.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.280
And one side says, Oh, agile will never work here.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.640
And the other side abuses it to dysfunction.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.880
Fragile as, as you call it.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:11.920
Right.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:17.400
Um, to me, it's, it's encouraged people to.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.640
Every six months, figure out a way to reduce by an order of magnitude,

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.830
your deployment time, right.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:37.950
It, it, and, um, a lot of the strategies around preventing error to the customer.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:43.380
Um, that we used to do, well, certainly a lot of the strategies we used to do in

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:49.740
the old package, pre-packaged software world, um, just start dumb today.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.710
Right.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:52.270
Yeah, you should prevent.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.110
Okay.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.900
But don't over prevent, right?

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.620
How, well, how do we figure that out?

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.060
Well, you know, flight control is a great system.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.500
That's an exposure controls, a great system for this.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:10.460
It's better to improve your observability to understand the errors in flight than

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:15.900
it is to, um, when you're operating the service, then to put all of that energy

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.660
into your prevention test code that you can't reuse once operating.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:29.880
Like the other thing, just to briefly rant around testing, um, the, that the

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.960
same organization talked to me and they're like, but Brent, we really

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.880
want to prevent regressions.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.760
And I'm like, what do you mean?

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:46.380
Well, we had a bug that was in the product for seven years and it just

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.040
hit us, uh, and cause an outage.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:54.700
And I'm like, okay, but it had no impact for seven years.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:03.080
And so now you want to, to spawn up a needle in the haystack exercise where

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.160
you don't even know if there's a needle in the haystack and your rate at which

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.040
you can go through the haystacks is significantly slower in which, in

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.230
terms of the rate at which new haystacks are for me, I'm like, you're asking.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.200
The old ways will not scale to solve the problem you have today.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.240
What you need to do going to your point around what's the goal.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.860
What you need to do is a minimize the amount of time the customer is in,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.180
is in pain, not move all of that energy to, we must prevent pain.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:37.700
Okay.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.500
Brent, it is 2024.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.220
Yes, I agree.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.340
Any, any problem as you're describing your sounds really hard.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.380
Easy answer.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:48.820
Always AI.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:49.900
LLM.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.380
Tell, tell, tell them to use an LLM to solve it.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:57.820
That's just what you can do because as we know, AI is magic.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.660
What you do is you feed, you make an LLM out of your code and then you ask a

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:09.080
prompt where the needle is and it just tells you, cause it's AI and it's magic.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.460
Right.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.060
Actually.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.540
And we can just do multi-agent AI and just have the AI talk to each other.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:17.740
Yeah.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.940
Have one that generates the code.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.660
In fact, why don't we get rid of the customers and just deliver our software to AI?

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.580
And it'll tell us if there are bugs because it's AI and it's magic.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.580
Right.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.460
And that's an excellent point.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.900
And like, tell me how we would even get, I mean, how would we get a

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.420
faster feedback loop than that?

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.460
We can't.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.940
And as we know, fast feedback loops and, and, but obviously we are being facetious.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:48.300
But I do know that you had another story we talked about briefly in the,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.300
in the, in the intro, I'm going to put you on the spot for a bit.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.900
Um, and it goes back to people thinking AI is magic.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:01.820
And there's, I forget the details now, but there is something around a team wanting

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:07.380
to use AI or LLMs to solve one of the longest known problems in testing.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.380
Yes.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.380
And, and I will set it up a little bit.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.140
Cause I didn't remember as I was talking, I went to GTAC, the Google

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.100
test automation conference in 2008.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:23.530
And I saw speakers from reputable, high quality software engineering

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.210
companies across the industry.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.610
And I remember I tweeted, which is the thing we did back when, um, used to be

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:34.370
a platform called Twitter that was fun for it's like, you know, sharing ideas

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.410
with the little community there.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:36.970
It was pretty popular for a while.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:42.290
I think it's been dead for a while, but on Twitter, I tweeted about the

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.890
fact that they should rename the conference, the flaky test conference.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:50.850
Cause of these illuminaries from around Facebooks and Netflix's and

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:55.570
Google's every single talk had at least one section, not a large section

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.330
talking about flaky tests.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:36:59.780
Yes.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:09.600
The, the primary bane, uh, in existence, like just to go back to like,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.040
but one of my experiences around, and I think you've done speeches on this,

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.560
so you can probably rattle off all the causes.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.320
I've done a great deal of time trying to repress, um, my time as a tester.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:30.750
Um, but one of the causes that kind of goes into the last topic around overuse

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:38.950
of the prevention techniques is, um, One of the main reasons why software doesn't

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.350
work when it goes to production is because production is dirty.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.340
And when we test in a local thing, we try to, we kind of do it in a clean room

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.300
exercise, some teams will do things like, you know, they, they have the ability to

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.780
dirty up their current, their current environment, but it eventually gets out

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.380
of sync and, um, that's why they should just test in production.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:02.540
Agreed.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:11.310
Um, the, but that's also one of the causes of flakiness.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:12.600
Right.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.600
It's, oh, well, it's because you haven't really set up your test.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:23.280
Uh, in my experience, you haven't really set up, set up the initial sets of, uh,

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:33.530
the test before you engage the Oracle part of it to, to guarantee that there

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.890
isn't variance in the Oracle bit of it.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.250
It's like, no, right.

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:43.690
Sometimes system goes slower and, and, and if you're waiting for this

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:48.010
event to trigger within five seconds, like sometimes it doesn't do that.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:49.090
Right.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:56.110
Um, anyway, I'm going to, so I guess the question is, okay, to what degree

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.150
could we apply LLM today?

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:03.790
That's the question I have is can we, it's flaky tests, age old problem.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.750
As you know, as I just stated five minutes ago, anytime we have a hard

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:08.950
problem, it's unsolvable.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.430
All we do is all we do is throw AI at it and it's solved.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:13.310
It's magic.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:14.470
Right.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:16.740
Okay.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.340
Is that it?

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.260
That's it.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.380
So, so is that true?

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.260
Tell me why that is or isn't true.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:31.420
Oh, um, I'm not entirely certain at this point in time, because I do think, I do

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:37.720
think, to me, I do think we could apply LLM to solve that problem.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:45.380
Um, but at the end of it, what I'm trying to load up, uh, into it using

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:54.180
my intuition is, okay, but is the ROI of that approach going to be lesser?

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.420
Is it going to be worth it?

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.060
Right.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.100
Because I could go, all right.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:03.100
Well, we could chain together a bulge of multi-agent LLMs, one covering each

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.780
other, one, you know, we run code.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:11.450
And then we go, Oh, how do we make this, um, less flaky, right?

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.530
And it's going to be around setting up the environment.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.930
A lot of the times from my experience.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.000
Um, but then, right.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:26.620
What happens at the LLM, um, goes after, goes after the same hack we used to do

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:31.700
in tests and, you know, Oh, just change the sleep from five to 15.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.180
Sure.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.460
Sure.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.500
More sleeps.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.180
That's the solution and more retries.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:38.740
Right.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.790
More retries, more sleeps.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:47.030
Uh, if, if we want to implement that, then absolutely, then I'm going to change my

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.150
answer as far less complex, absolutely.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.150
L L and could solve all of those problems.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:02.190
It falls into that, you know, it's just, it's not magic.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:04.030
That's, that's really the answer.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.790
It's not magic.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:09.430
You'd have to look at, I'm not even sure what data you would feed into the

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:16.680
LLM to help solve the flaky test problem flaky tests that, I mean, there's

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.240
multiple, multiple criteria to define flaky at the very least level, the very

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:27.960
smallest level, uh, it's tests that either fail or pass when they shouldn't based

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.000
on the condition of the system.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.000
The, the approach I would take initially.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.360
What essentially, um, the way I'm thinking of it, it's probably simpler ways of doing

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:48.120
it, but run, uh, take the code, run it through, um, LLM with a series of prompts

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:55.380
that are related to testing the code, similar to like a code review.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:06.290
Hey, Hey, LLM evaluate, uh, to what degree this, this test case is going to be

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:10.500
resilient, um, or flaky, right.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.140
And then propose fix.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:20.940
Again, it's, it's too magic key because when testers write or developers, you

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:25.980
know, back in this century, write test code, they run that test and it gives

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:33.710
them the proper result, the flaky part comes from, uh, almost a drift into failure

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.390
of Sydney Decker type situation.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:42.870
It, a test that should pass or a test that should fail passes because of multiple

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.990
different system factors happening at the same time, this test always passes

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:54.670
in less run while memory is below 60% and time is changing over from 11 59

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.830
am to 12 p.m.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.040
Okay.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.960
Uh, your L how is your LLM going to find that bit of it?

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:09.800
I guess you could note again, I wouldn't use an LLM for this is for traditionally

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.400
maybe cause maybe cause I don't know AI or LLMs well enough, but this is

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.880
traditionally where we'd write a model to try it like a scoring to look at.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.040
Okay.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.440
This test has timing dependencies.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.560
This test has memory dependencies.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.320
They make it more prone to flakiness and I could, I would want

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.800
to reduce my flakiness score.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.080
Um, but I think every test, like I

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.360
have a test that does, you know, verify that two divided by two equals one,

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.600
the flakiness of that test, the flakiness factor is zero.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.040
If I have a test that's very complicated, that relies on a bunch of systems

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.000
things, I would say the flakiness factor is a much higher number.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.600
If it's zero to one, it's probably somewhere in the point, you know,

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.290
seven, 5.8 area, uh, and that, but that's just an algorithm.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.410
That's not AI.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:02.770
I still don't understand how the LLM is going to help you understand and

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.570
fix flaky tests other than a wish for magic.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:07.720
Yeah.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.320
Uh, I don't, I, I'm, I'm, for the listeners, I am sharing screen.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.560
I've gotten the Google scholar look, just did a search for LLM solving flaky tests.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:26.850
And there are a bunch of articles on this topic, at least the top four seem to be on that.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:33.390
So, um, it's, it isn't magic.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.070
It's probably going to be work.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.720
And now I am fascinated by this and I'll be typing into it.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.280
I'm not going to try to read it and regurgitate it here.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.680
Um, but again, they talked about something called a neuro symbolic technique.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.770
Great, great.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:58.010
Here's, I'm going to go back 10 years to what I know and what I know is not.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.250
I mean, I know probably more about AI than the average software engineer,

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:07.090
but I know enough to know, I know very, very little, but as you know, I, I, I fake

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.250
things quite well in the old days.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:09.610
Yeah.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.770
As you remember at the time, I worked a lot with not cheating.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:16.170
I got the pond over an MSR doing a bunch of, he did, he did all the heavy work.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.050
I just helped him review and think of ideas.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:24.850
Um, but, uh, in that old MSR software development model, they would take,

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:29.730
they would analyze every test that's ever been labeled as flaky and come up with

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:34.370
factors for what made them flaky, why they were, you know, what, what factors were in

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.890
there and they would build a model that would generate a flakiness score.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:44.260
Uh, to me that, and again, a flaky test isn't a bad test.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:51.000
Um, it, but it requires more human time to understand if the results are something

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.240
you need to care about or not.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:57.190
Uh, you could, I mean, you can, once you know, a test is flaky through an

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:00.910
algorithm, you could refactor it and make it into two less flaky tests or, or

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.030
three, even less flaky tests as possible.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:08.070
You could put constraints around some of the external inputs to reduce that flakiness.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:14.740
But I, given how long I've been in software, given what I know about how

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:19.860
LLMs are not magic, I don't think the flaky test today, at least with the

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:24.420
technology we have today, the flaky test problem is not a solvable problem.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.220
Not, not, not a hundred percent solvable problem.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.080
Meaning do all the work you want with LLMs and burning up the environment.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.300
You will still have flaky tests fewer.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.020
You'll still have them.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:47.500
That is the closest thing I have heard ever from you shutting,

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.300
shutting the door on a topic.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:49.820
That's fast.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.900
That by itself is fascinating to me.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:58.740
Um, yeah, but the, the thing is, um,

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.660
you're right, the tech may not be there today.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:03.070
Right.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:14.680
Um, the, but like one of the things, one of the things I, um, just noticed, like

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.080
one of the papers that I found on Google scholar, they, it's a small sample size,

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:29.420
but they tried, um, they tried using their algorithm to fix 79 tests, uh, on,

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.420
on public get hubs and 19 of them were accepted.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:34.880
Right.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.720
So yeah, that's, that's your point.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:45.140
It's not a hundred percent, but, um, 25% pears down the problem, uh,

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.140
in a way that is helpful.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:53.220
Here's another study I want, uh, again, I, I'm just going to lean on what I know.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:48:00.190
Uh, I wonder if, and going back to TDD and how TDD makes more testable

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:05.650
code, uh, like we talked about earlier, I would also like to look at a code

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:11.450
base and understand from a code base, how light, like there's a likelihood.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.330
I don't know how to measure it yet, but there is a likelihood based on the

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:20.890
characteristics of a code base or a code, a code module of how likely it

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.810
is that flaky tests exists for that module.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:29.450
For example, if you have a, an API that takes 13 input parameters and they

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:35.980
interact with each other, uh, I would, there's a good chance that you will

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.180
have flaky tests for that module.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:38.820
Why?

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:45.650
I mean, it's an interesting hypothesis and, and I'm probably well positioned.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:55.080
No, I don't have yet automated access to a sort of get hub app, but for me,

00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:02.930
it's, it's more around timing, right?

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:08.450
Clicky test comes from there's some element of non-deterministic behavior.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:16.360
Uh, in the system you're evaluating or actually in the test code itself, it's

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.040
that non-determinism that causes flakiness.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:22.920
Maybe.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.440
Yeah.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.040
I think there's something there.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:31.890
Anyway, I think this is truly one of those hard problems that, well, actually,

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.170
I'm going to change my answer in the middle of it before you even heard

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:37.330
what my answer was, I think this is a hard problem in test.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:43.000
I think it will remain a hard problem, but because I think you and I know this

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.080
flaky tests can often, in fact, I won't even say from time to time can often

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:53.280
actually provide value, even though they're flaky, I don't know if this is

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.800
a problem I talked about not being solvable today.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.720
Is it a problem worth solving?

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.160
Probably to some degree, right?

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.600
We talked about testing in production.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.040
Wait, we want to test in dirty systems, right?

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:29.840
Dirty systems is one of the sources of non-deterministic behavior, right?

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:36.730
Um, like the alternative is not test and let outages occur and react that way.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:42.770
I'm not certain that that's right, but I definitely don't think we're going

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:49.470
to resolve flaky tests that occur in the prevention side of it.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:53.760
I mean, that one should be resolvable, I think.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:59.960
Like, but part of me is just like, yeah, quit trying to create

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:05.120
pre-production environments where you try to test how well this stuff

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.690
works in the real world when it's not even related to the real world.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:14.040
Yeah, well, I think it's worth it.

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:18.950
I know we need to close here in a second, but I worry, especially based on

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:23.390
the first hypothesis you brought, um, and it could be, I'm worrying

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:29.200
because my brain is sleep deprived, but I'm going to come up with a generality,

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.400
which I, which I think is true here for me at least.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.040
Uh, and I want to fix this problem.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:43.400
Uh, why do we continuously try and solve the wrong problem or have a solution

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.240
for the wrong problem?

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.040
Uh, and again, not this isn't a big problem.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.000
We should try and solve.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:56.310
I think, uh, there's a lot more systems thinking needed in software for it to advance.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:58.070
How do all the pieces fit together?

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.510
Is our flaky tests a problem?

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:02.470
Yes.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:06.590
Are they my biggest problem for satisfying my customers and

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.790
improving retention and stuff?

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:11.300
Mmm, maybe, maybe not.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.980
Uh, here I think about Jimbo and his, his last work.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:15.900
I remember, right.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.580
It's he created a tool called the riskitizer.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.300
Yeah.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:25.620
Which, and it's just like, like my answer to your question is, well, it

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:34.440
depends on what it's testing and like how much that represents, uh, risk to our

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.520
definition of customer quality, right?

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.120
The, the ability for the customer to solve their problem, right?

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:46.130
The, if it's a small risk, then flakiness doesn't really matter.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:46.810
Yeah.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:50.810
And, and if, if you, maybe it is, maybe, yeah, we want our feedback loops from

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:55.490
our CI to be, uh, they gotta be much more accurate because we lost a million

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:58.650
dollars yesterday because one of our flaky tests passed, it should have failed.

00:52:58.650 --> 00:52:59.690
It'll be made a bad deployment.

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:00.450
Right.

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:04.730
Uh, then yeah, you gotta go fix that and you don't, and again, uh, theory

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:08.330
of constraints, you don't eliminate the problem completely.

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:12.410
You mitigate the problem until it's no longer your biggest sticking point,

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:15.810
which you could do then, which you would solve enough of it.

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.090
You would make that test less flaky.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:19.530
You would temporarily remove that test till you could refactor it.

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:20.090
Whatever.

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.790
Um, write a smaller test that gave you, you know, 90% of the

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:24.970
act three that you could trust.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:28.130
Whatever the solution is, you're trying to mitigate that problem.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:30.330
So you can solve your overall problem.

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.530
But I think people just look at, Oh, this is, this is broken.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:33.570
Let me go fix this.

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.650
Software developers aren't just infatuated with solving a problem.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:42.130
Well, no, my friends that differently software developers in general are

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:47.810
infatuated with developing solutions for perceived problems, not wallowing

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:53.150
in the problem they want to solve and not weighing and debating to see if

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:56.050
that's the biggest problem in their system that needs to be solved.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:59.370
That's where we, and that's where LLMs are not going to help us.

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.530
It requires humans.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.050
Maybe an LLM can do this.

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:06.610
I could I feed an LLM here are all my known problems of my software development.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:10.390
The problem is you can't know them all, but you have to find the one that

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:12.370
matters the most and work on that one first.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:16.650
And then just God, people just like dive right to the, I'm going to implement

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.410
an algorithm for that or put AI on it.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.010
It's magic.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:23.450
There is, there is, and I wouldn't be surprised.

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:28.250
I'll, I'll save my, my check on Google scholar until after the podcast.

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:28.810
Good.

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:36.250
But there is a, um, to me, it does feel like there is.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:42.410
Some room for, you know, the next doctorate, um, PhD.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.650
I have a topic for them.

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:44.530
All right.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:47.610
It's in, it's in there somewhere in systems thinking.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:49.770
It's, it's okay.

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:59.390
System thinking is super important, but when the system grows, um, orders

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:05.010
of magnitude beyond the cognitive limitations of the human, right?

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:09.530
How do we, how do we as humans go about solving that?

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.240
Right?

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.800
The, the, like there's simple things all the time that I am dealing

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.360
with and I can put out fires too.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.880
Like people come to me all the times.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.400
They break.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.600
Can you give me advice on this KPI?

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.200
And then I'm like, yeah, I can.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.000
Right.

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:30.960
Um, the problem with that KPI though, is that there's this other KPI

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.600
that's battling against it.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:37.320
And if you guys don't work together to try to solve both of your KPI's

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.400
and one's going to continuously cannibalize the other, and you're just

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.840
going to go in circles because you're not evaluating the system.

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.500
So this is, and we got it.

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.540
We got to end cause I got to go to another meeting, but this is

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:57.100
where like the software developers, they got to help them not teaching them testing.

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.660
I think that's relatively easy testers.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.260
Don't get mad at me.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.780
There's there's yes, there's nuance.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.260
It's systems thinking, critical thinking.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:12.240
It's those skills, those, those, those thinking skills that I see

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.520
missing the most from software developers.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:15.640
Teach them that.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:23.040
Uh, even more so teach them to the degree that they create, in my view,

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:29.920
create automated systems that help you analyze what you were about to do.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.440
Now, what that means.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.600
I don't, I don't know.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:37.430
Look before you leap a little bit, stop this ready fire aim stuff already.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:38.230
Already fire.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.990
No.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:46.350
So, so like here is a, here is a problem with a, with a large enough, uh, system.

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:47.070
Right.

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:54.740
You have one dev team way over here has no idea that after, after goes through

00:56:54.740 --> 00:57:01.360
the entire complex domino chain, that his check-in could, could break this product.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.440
He's never even heard of, right?

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:12.010
It's it's how, how, how is it even possible for us to proactively determine that?

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:18.370
And if it's not possible, which I would argue that not possible in linear time

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:28.850
anyway, um, then what we need to do is figure out how do we detect and react to it?

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.230
Right.

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:35.630
To me, I think it's pointless to focus so much on prevention.

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:40.830
It's no, you need to detect and react to it optimized for reaction.

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:42.150
That's my view.

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:43.790
Sounds good.

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:44.110
All right.

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:45.950
We got to, you got to close this thing.

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:46.790
That's close.

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.830
This has been AI Alan.

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:50.190
