00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.940
Welcome to A.B.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.460
Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.540
Now on with the show.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.540
Today on the A.B.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.980
Testing Podcast, Brent will eat food.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.100
Hey everyone, I'm Alan.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.220
I'm Brent.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.940
And Brent is eating and crinkling already.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.180
It's good, good fun.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.820
Everyone will pay $5 to the first of the three that can guess what I'm eating today.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.860
It's a new segment on the A.B.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.860
Testing Podcast.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.760
Is this like what's in my pocket?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.240
It's like that, but the audio version of it.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.080
Oh my God.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.440
I think it's episode 138.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.700
Still season one, because we don't do seasons because that's a thing that other podcasts

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.660
do and we're not like other podcasts.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.860
Our season never ends.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.860
It does.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.860
A lot of things never end.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.790
Kind of like pandemic.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.080
Yeah.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.300
A real quick rant that didn't post this.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.740
Last weekend I got excited.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.700
I logged into one of the, I'm not going to throw anybody under the bus, a local hospital

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.970
and got an appointment set up for May 2nd to get my first shot.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.210
And I got an email back the next day saying, hey, we made a mistake.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.410
None of those slots are actually available.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.350
You're out of luck.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.790
And then there was rage and apparently people, other people must have raged more than I did

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.150
because then the next day got another email saying, uh, hey, we're going to call you and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.350
reschedule those things so you don't hate us as much.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.350
That was the good news.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.110
And then they called today, but, uh, I was out on a hike and my phone dropped right

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.510
after I picked it up and they didn't call back.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.870
And I don't know if that lost my place on the list or what.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.460
So right now I have no appointment to get a vaccine, but I'm hoping I do someday.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.140
Um, I am in this similar place.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.220
Although, um, are you, are you currently picky?

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.940
Uh, not yet.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.140
I, I was excited cause I, you, I think it was you that told me Moderna is the, is the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.540
best one in your opinion.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.940
Uh, actually if I did tell you that I am now reversing that cause I literally, I now

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.760
have a whole bunch of friends who are going through shot number two and literally a hundred

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.010
percent of them are reporting life is hell after shot two.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.770
I heard that from, uh, the teams, the teams on my folk, the folks on my team who had Pfizer

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.770
as well.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.570
Yeah, it could just be a thing.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:55.600
It could just be, uh, crawl under the covers and suffer for the day or so till it's over.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.660
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.220
I'm currently favoring Pfizer.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.580
Okay.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.120
I'm going to take what I can get.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.920
That's my plan.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.160
Yeah.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.970
The, the, the J and J one is probably the one I'm least likely.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.610
All right then.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.530
So we have a podcast today.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.970
We got stuff to talk about.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.850
Um, and we should probably get going.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.650
I don't know.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.740
What do you want to talk about?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.860
Uh, stuff.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.180
Okay.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.060
I got stuff to talk about.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.300
Newest one.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.820
I might not even have five for Friday at this, but I mentioned it to you as we're logging

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.180
in today, I have a brand new Mac book.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.940
My last one, um, it still works, but I just wanted to get the battery replaced and they

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.940
won't do it.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.940
It's out of warranty.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.420
So it says just your, you're due for a refresh anyway, cause your computer is four years

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.420
old.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.300
So I got a new Mac book M one.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.900
It is lickety split fast and I've never heard the fans turn on yet.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.140
I can't make it work hard enough to actually try and spin up fans.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.570
So I need to this weekend to try and do something a little bit more strenuous to it.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.770
Start advent for coding early.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.430
Maybe, maybe those things don't let you do the brute force solution.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.610
Those things don't really compute a lot, but anyway, I like it so far.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.250
Uh, totally irrelevant to the podcast.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.050
Uh, I'm in the, I'm in the market for a new laptop piece of crap laptops that

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.250
I've been using.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.940
Like I think, I think my laptop now is at eight years old.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.710
You know, you work for a company with a lot of money.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.950
They'll probably get you a new one.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.470
Yeah.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.690
The issue is I need, I'm picky now on which one the, so it's eight years old.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.050
Like I can plug it in.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.450
It still works as long as I don't, like it's now got like 15 minutes of battery,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.770
even on the full charge.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.130
All right.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.690
For the listeners at home, Brent, uh, actually slid his chair back, opened his

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.770
laptop bag, got his laptop out.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.810
He opened it.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.130
He like, they flipped it around, looked at the bottom a little bit, looked at the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.490
top, opened it up, and now he's typing a letter from his laptop.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.810
No, I'm not.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.130
Cause the battery's already dead.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.610
All right.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.930
Um, the battery life lasts just a little long.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.490
I'm trying to just trying to find on here when I got the damn thing.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.130
I don't see a date anywhere.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.210
Oh, there's one.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.450
Uh, I believe that says 2014.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.370
All right.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.330
Damn.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.580
Yeah.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.350
Anyway, the issue so much for me, it isn't, it's the screen size now.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.070
It's, it's an order because I'm old.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:52.540
And, um, it's essentially when I blow up the screen so I can actually read what

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.380
it's saying, I now have essentially two inches of real estate and therefore I

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.100
can't do anything with the stupid thing.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.500
So I actually went with, I, this topic is not very exciting, but I went

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.340
with a smaller computer this time.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.940
Uh, I had a choice of getting a 16 inch MacBook or a 13 inch MacBook

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.340
with the new MacBook and I went 13 because there'll, there'll be a world

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.140
at the end of this where I'll go back to traveling often and it is impossible

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.140
to open a 16 inch laptop on an airplane.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.370
So I thought ahead, hold the smaller one.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.290
Okay.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.370
So, all right, then.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.730
All right.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.170
Let's, let's get on with the podcast.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.690
Hey everyone.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.650
I'm still Alan.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.610
I'm great.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.170
We did that part.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.090
I, um, I mentioned, I did a teaser on one of the three dot slack.com, which

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.890
you can join just go to modern testing.org and find the link.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.210
And there are several of the three there.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.010
In fact, if you count up all the three, there's only, only ever three listeners.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.850
They take turns listening, but we have 633 members of our one of the three.com,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.770
one of the three dot slack.com slack community.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.770
You're welcome to join that.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:04.400
And yesterday I teased a little bit because yesterday or the day before was

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.040
the exact two year anniversary of me joining the organization that I'm in.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.300
The bi-annual Alan changes jobs event.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.220
It is, it is.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.300
And, and bring his tease about this and I was told, no, no, no,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.660
but then it always happens.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.620
And in this case though, it's not as dramatic as the other ones.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:34.700
Uh, what has happened is my org largely supports the division that I'm in

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.980
because the division that I'm in, well, my org does internet infrastructure,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:47.340
cloud CDN, uh, C C I CD, uh, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.060
You name a tool used in deployment infrastructure is probably supported by my

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.100
team while our largest customer is the division Maria and we do work company

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.240
wide, which has been fine.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.600
Unity is very flat.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.640
We don't have a lot of hierarchy.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.480
It makes it easy to do.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.200
However, uh, that was out of convenience and it was out of convenience of my

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.400
management chain to fund that, uh, central org within their org, but

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.480
recently unity has formed a org, especially for central stuff like this.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.160
There's a labs group there and labs is like lot like Microsoft research,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.880
much smaller scale.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:32.950
There are a similar team to mine supporting a lot of the desktop developers.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.990
And we tend to overlap and not optimize as well as we should being in different

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.430
orgs and some other things that I won't go into,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.310
but, uh, we, I'm just, it's just a drag and drop reorg.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.500
I, my, and my org are being drug over to another part of unity with a new manager.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.780
Well, we will continue with our mission, but also, uh, work on.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.140
There's a couple other things we're doing there.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.820
One is just keep doing what we're doing to is to fix that alignment or not.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.780
I shouldn't say fix.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.580
It's not broken.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.460
It's to increase the collaboration between our team and the other team at unity

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.660
who have similar goals for different developers.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.260
And also to bring our culture with us.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.220
Uh, we have a reputation for the way we work with, uh, things we've talked

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.020
about here, uh, transparency, accountability, collaboration, psychological

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.020
safety, all that stuff.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.740
Uh, we're going to bring all that with us and shove it down their throat.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.300
No, we're going to, but safely.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.240
So, uh, yeah, so it's going to be fun.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.560
That's effective Monday.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.960
Just wrapping all that stuff up by the time this hits, it'll all be

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.880
announced across the company.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.280
And I didn't, I don't think I revealed any trade secrets, just to, just

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.880
to drag and drop, reorg gives me a little different perspective.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.160
So it counts as my migration because I have different people I'm working

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.920
with, even though I'm generally doing many of the same things.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.440
Um, doesn't feel like, unlike last few, it doesn't feel like you're anxious

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.240
in any way, shape or form, but what, what, what, um, in terms of your

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.240
team's missions, oh, this would be a good opportunity to load up the unity.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.280
Three questions, if I could, uh, which I can't, our mission doesn't change.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.120
Where do you see an advantage for you executing your mission, your mission?

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.280
Uh, and where do you see a disadvantage?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.200
Well, I think it's obvious this is good questions.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.320
Nice interviewing Brent.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.760
The advantage is working from a central organization will increase

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.640
discoverability from the other parts of unity that we, that we work with,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.920
but sort of ad hoc, uh, it makes it a little easy for them to discover.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.160
Okay.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.040
This central org has the ha is the place for us to go ask questions.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.640
The disadvantage of course, is anytime that the team you work with the most,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.440
uh, we're being not in the same org as them.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.760
Uh, there's always a little bit of a fear or a challenge there, but again,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.230
we are transparent and flat enough.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.670
I don't think it'll make a difference, but, uh, it would be silly of me not to at

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.170
least consider that it could be an issue, but I'm not worried.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.190
I mean, your culture is different than here.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.180
So that's what's going on with me.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.260
Not the, not a big change.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.100
Sorry for the cliffhanger in slack and then the not that exciting of a change,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.700
but we'll hear more stories cause you get to work with different people,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.020
a whole different set of folks get to be my peers or as I should say,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.860
a whole different set of people have to suffer through my questioning and, uh,

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.970
discernment,

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.650
interrogation,

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.050
discernment,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.620
Oh, discernment. Sorry.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.380
All right. So, um, that is what's going on with me.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:52.300
I actually have a question for actually have two topics for today.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.460
Would you like to start with data or test automation?

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.980
Oh, I want to start with, uh,

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.860
uh, automated checking for sure.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.700
I would like to start by punching you in the throat.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.700
So, uh, a little bit of a soapbox leading to a question.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.900
You've all heard me see, say and discuss and write about that developers should

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.620
be doing the vast majority of the testing, testing,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.060
and that they're definitely the best suited.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.380
Not only can they test to the best,

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.020
definitely the best suited for test automation.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.820
Also realize, well, before I even get there,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.820
I will repeat a rant from, uh, maybe it was last episode,

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.700
more and more. I'm thinking that nobody should be writing any web automation.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.710
Given, given how many of those tests it should be writing, not very many.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.990
And given the massive improvements in reliability in the just recorded tests,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.110
and there was a time when we hated those,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.630
but for the web stuff with the AI they have in there,

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.510
which can detect changes and the massive amount saved and the fact that you're

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.510
well handcrafted tests are going to be flaky anyway, because, because reasons,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.030
I would just have everyone use,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.150
oddify Mabel test and test project, whatever,

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.550
something that lets you quickly create some tests for the main things you'd to

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.350
check in the, in the web, web UI, but that's not the rant.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.190
I want to get out. It's not my question for you. Uh,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.990
the question is despite the little bubble I live in,

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.950
where developers do write tests, many testers,

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.990
checkers, no testers insist that the majority of the industry doesn't and can't

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.430
work that way.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.950
And that just because of the way things are and because changing things is,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.780
is harder that they have to write the automation.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.010
So, um, so despite all that, okay,

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.890
that isn't even my question yet. My question is I'm going somewhere.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.570
I forgot where it was a couple of times, but I'll get there. Okay.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.460
Let me just ask you this. So if I'm a tester,

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.460
and now you don't talk to any testers,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.900
but if I'm a tester on your team and I say to you,

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.930
I would like to get into automation because that's what they say on the

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.250
internet. They say, I'm a manual tester and I want to get into automation.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.690
And I face Palm twice, but if I say that to you,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.220
I'm a manual tester and I want to get into automation. What do you tell me?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.950
I, I, I'm like, what the hell have you been doing?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.430
What do you mean you're an automated tester? I said, I'm a manual tester.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.710
I want to get into automation.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.190
I feebly responded because I'm like, uh,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.270
the idea of a manual tester and on my team are

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:57.470
okay. All right. So you didn't play the part as I wished. Oh,

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.590
we should do,

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.350
we need a follow up to the modern testing manager versus traditional test manager

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.590
where we talk about automation or something like that. It'll be fun.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.910
Uh, didn't plan ahead well enough on that, but no,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.990
that would be a good idea though.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.510
I am thinking more and more and more that the answer like I'm drinking some

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.150
tea right now. I usually have some water here,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.390
but I think the answer to any injury or ailment is to drink more water.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.790
If you, if you're feel horrible after the second modern shop, just drink water.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.870
You'll be fine. Break a leg, drink more water. You'll be fine. Uh,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.630
but for the automate for any problems in testing and quality,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.470
my answer is getting to be more and more again and again, time after time,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.750
pair with the developer.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.030
Uh, I was actually going along the same line that I was thinking, you know what,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.390
uh, let's find a bug for you to go fix or something,

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.070
something that's a lightweight coding exercise.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.230
But I need to automate the UI, man. That's, that's,

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.750
that's what the cool kids do in this case. Also,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.630
I is also a broken problem where these people writing web automation,

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.190
they're automating a bunch of BS.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.620
I'm going to automate these user scenarios because I can.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.130
So I wonder if imagine today we did,

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.330
imagine this today when someone wants to get into automation,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.730
they take a class or they there's no books, they read some blogs,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.330
they watch a whole bunch of crap about selenium.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.650
I don't think that's right because then they end up automating like these,

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.610
they don't automate the right things. They're,

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.330
they don't know how to design automated tests. I don't know what to automate.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.330
If you go talk to the dev and you say, Hey,

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.090
I want to get into automation and instead of this as great,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.930
what do you want to automate? And they say,

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:45.010
I want to make sure that I can put things in the shopping cart and check out,

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.210
blah, blah, blah, and do it in all these permutations. That's great.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:53.210
But we can do all that at the logic layer or just having that

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.170
conversation with the person who actually knows how it's implemented.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.370
And some people are going to say, but Alan, but Mr. Weasel,

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.890
when, when the developer, they, they,

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.850
they can't think about testing. They only care about the code and not the

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:12.090
customer and I bullshit and crap. Uh, and I,

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.490
if that accent defended anybody, I meant that to be, uh, just, uh,

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:20.370
me as a young, young tester. So, uh, I did not mean to, um,

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.330
insight that anybody that actually sounds like that person,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.650
I just made with anyone other but me.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.890
My, my, my, I wish my middle son were here.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:32.090
He has mastered the art of the, the,

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.490
the know it all bratty kid with.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.690
Yeah. That's so the, the point is, I think if you have a discussion, uh,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.930
and when you get over the fact that developers aren't going to be skewed or

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.770
tainted by the fact that know how it works,

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:49.050
you'll actually have a discussion on what the right things are to test and what

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.170
the right things are to automate.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.770
It goes back to the anger Weasel's tautology of you should automate 100% of

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.290
all the tests that should be automated. A lot of people today,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.490
especially in this web UI automation world are automating stuff that shouldn't

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.330
be automated.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.090
Yeah. Actually, I want to go back to a basic question. Yes.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.650
Like if you're a manual tester, somebody right now is going,

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.450
there's no such thing as manual testing. Do you call it manual programming?

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.790
But anyway, go on. No one's we're using the term to differentiate,

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.670
but no, uh, people who are creating test automation. So it's fine. No, no.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:28.110
So you have a manual tester and, and no one would say it's,

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.950
there's no such thing. I do think there's a large number of people would say

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.110
it's redundant. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And so like for me,

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.750
why is it that they're saying,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:45.150
I want to get into automation versus saying I want to get into

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:50.060
coding through automation.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.780
Like that, that to me is the thing that I think is the important sort of

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:01.530
perspective. Like I don't care. Like automation,

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.230
as you just called out, um, from a testing standpoint,

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.390
like we got accelerate that's that absolutely tells the businesses,

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.630
your team,

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:18.070
your software company is going to have a

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.750
stronger performance when your devs own the

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.510
automation. That is true. That is true. I don't think, and again,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.700
most of these people don't read book like accelerate.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.260
They don't read books. They don't want to program.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.580
They just want to make sure. Remember we started AB testing way back when,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.020
to help people transition as, as jobs are changing.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.900
These people for the most part want to get into automation because they're

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.940
worried their job will go away if they don't.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.450
And what this, in my opinion,

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:58.290
what happens because of this is a bunch of people learn to crapily use

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.010
some crappy tools to create some crappy automation.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:06.070
And I want that to stop. Well, yeah,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.710
I don't have any data that says to what degree that happens.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.790
I know that it does happen cause I've,

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.030
I've had to manage several of those transitions

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.670
and it's a, it's a journey,

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.470
but it's one that doubles down on things that I just don't

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.630
agree with anymore. Right. It's, it's, it's so,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.190
if a, if a manual tester on my team came to me and said, Hey,

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:37.950
I want to do that. My first question is going to be why, why,

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.910
why, why are you doubling down on harming your career?

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.950
If that's where you want to go, you need to go in a different direction.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.710
And for our world and for, and actually, and as you and I see,

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.140
the bubble that we live in is getting bigger and bigger and affect huger and

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.100
huger. That's what you're doing is actually, yes,

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.220
it's true and more and more of the world. And you're right.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.180
My answer would be, well, if I had, I would never have, I mean,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.220
I may have a tester,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.060
but they would never want to get into automation because it understands that

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.200
automation is the developer's job. So this can't happen in our world,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.180
but in a world where a tester asks you this,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.500
yeah, I think getting into motivation and understanding why is really important.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.780
But if they just want to do it, learn more about it,

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.740
the paths that we give people today,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.340
the paths that we give people today who want to get into automation are the

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.540
wrong ones. Cause they, they lead them down a path,

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.780
which is not productive for their career. I think, yeah, no.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.980
So what I, I want, because they don't design good tests.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.580
They don't use the power of the computer to make some aspects of testing

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.860
easier. It said, or they just want to automate a bunch of clicky,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.340
clicky, clicky user tasks and ask trivia questions about X path that I see on

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.540
LinkedIn all the time. I think by talking to the developer,

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.780
how should we test this? Cause the tester, they're going to have,

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.820
and despite the fact that the arguments people have with me,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.380
when I said developers could test the expertise of the tester is if they're a

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.660
dedicated testing specialist,

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.100
they're going to have better testing ideas for a lot of things.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.540
So talk about all those ideas with the person who should be writing the

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.900
automation in the first place.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.380
And maybe they'll take you under their wing and have you write some of the more

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:32.460
simpler ones to start or pair a program with them and get an idea of how to write

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.580
test automation from someone who understands code design and test design,

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.300
automated test design, probably far better than you do.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.420
That is a much better path to long-term success for your career.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.020
Then reading a bunch of blogs on Selenium and getting excited because you can

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.460
make some archaic stuff, click a button on a screen.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.100
Again, it comes back to their motivation.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.820
If their motivation is saving their career, then,

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.340
then I would absolutely guide them in an entirely different direction. Right.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.860
It's, it's, I'm like, yeah, that's,

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.980
obviously if they're coming to me, right, if they want to go to,

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.300
let's say one of the other thought leaders in this space,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.340
that has a polar opposite opinion, right? Maybe that's the answer.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.020
I send them to there because look,

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.060
I can't, from where I'm coming from,

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.700
I can't even see you from, from, from where I'm at. Right. I, that's,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.980
that's now an entirely foreign idea to me. And to me, it's harmful.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.260
But the,

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.700
but if that's their motivation, then their motivation,

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.540
my answer would be to redirect to something that I felt was far more

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.140
productive. Right. The,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.720
if their other motivation might be to,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:50.880
hey,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.960
we're lacking coverage and I want to,

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.350
I want to accelerate the coverage. Hey,

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.190
I'm supportive of that. Right. That would be, again,

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.470
what you're saying is, Hey,

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.830
pair program with the developer who should be the one accountable for that

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:08.750
automation,

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.470
work through their template and, and,

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:18.190
and learn from that as you add additional coverage. Right.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.830
But also throw in, right.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.270
The,

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.630
the developer should not be allowing coverage into their suite,

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.390
unreviewed and do put them through at least the,

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.710
the code review and,

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.310
and those others are the processes.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.870
So that person gets familiarity with how code is produced.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.830
Design constructs,

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.830
that might pop out of that.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.100
Right. Um,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.020
it might not. Uh,

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.340
I would hope it did,

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.020
but in a way that didn't blow the person's mind.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.980
I don't know.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.120
I just typed into duck duck go. I'll, I'll,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.080
you won't hear me type in the edited version,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.000
but I typed in literally I'm a manual tester and I want to get into

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.960
automation. So let me lead you, read you a few of the, uh,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.080
I'm not going to go into the pages,

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.120
just the part that shows up in the search page. Um,

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:17.410
many manual testers wish to land an automation job with qualifications of

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.250
manual testing.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.410
The process of learning coding is tedious and for a person working as a manual

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.410
tester for so long, this means going back to square one,

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.530
never what other one it requires dedication, hard work, motivation,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:34.600
lots of time and money to train for a test automation job.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.240
You do not start with the test automation libraries to selenium.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.680
No, you start with something considering the market situation.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.720
Many manual testers are now becoming more interested in test automation.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.120
Some want to expand their skills by including programming,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.200
test automation framework in their testing toolbox.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.480
Others are contemplating switching direction completely. It goes on. I'm, I'm,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.440
it's making me sad. So the, the point there is, and tell me if I'm wrong,

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.480
I think one, you want to get motivation.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.560
Is the point there that our bubble is still too small or I mean,

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.840
I don't, I acknowledge I live in a bubble on this, on this front.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.920
We both do. I think the more we talk to people,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.760
the more I find out our bubble is bigger than we think it is sometimes.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.960
Maybe at least I think it is because a lot of people go, oh yeah,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.800
we already do that.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.560
Given these answers and given some of the folks who doubled down and freak out

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.960
when we do make some of our, uh, what our outlet,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.560
what are not outlandish points, uh, there are people out there with this,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.360
this is a, that's a thing they do.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.720
And I think the thing they should do when they want to get into automation is for

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.760
whatever reasons, the part that drives me crazy.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.360
They think I want to get into test automation.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.320
So I'm going to learn how to click around a webpage with this shiny new

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.390
framework. I think that's the wrong place to start. And I think I could just,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.270
do you want to think about test design? You want to make,

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.030
you want to do this one and I've done, I've,

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.590
I've talked about that before long in the past,

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.270
how to think about test design.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.990
I've given talks on test design that help you think like which tests should be

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.830
automated and not, and what you can use the power of the computer for.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.990
But I'm tired of doing that. It's not what I do anymore.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.510
I'd rather just, I think some good generic devices,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.910
if you want to get into automation or get into programming,

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.430
go talk to the developers on your team,

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:32.510
find opportunities to pair with them on bug fixing or automation ideas,

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.970
et cetera. And if, if,

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.970
if it comes back that every single absolutely no developers on the team want to

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:46.090
work with you on that, well one, I hope that's not the case, but two,

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.010
it's a different problem than it's a different problem. Exactly.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.530
And as you know, there's, there's part of this bubble is I listened to,

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.450
and I, I ranted a little bit about this on, on our Slack group,

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:02.130
but I listened to a panel of people who do exploratory testing and,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.200
which I have nothing against exploratory testing. Although once I,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.840
I made a joke about whether I could use the word exploratory testing.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.160
If I wasn't in the special club,

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.120
this was 15 years ago when a certain group of people on the internet were

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.720
talking about it a lot and correcting people that they didn't use it right.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.480
And one of them wrote me an email just bitching the hell out of me for,

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.480
for referring to it that way. And like, there's no club,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.660
you're just being a jerk. And well,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.260
there is a club and I was being a jerk.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.020
The folks on this panel talking about exploratory testing,

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.140
their ideas around ET were all fine.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.820
But the scenarios they described on why it was valuable for them are right out of

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.780
1992. They get a new,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.580
they're excited cause they get a new build from a development team they never

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.900
see. And they, and with no instructions and no notes,

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:04.730
and they get to figure out how it works and give them feedback. And well,

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.530
I guess maybe that could have been fun for me one time in my career.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.490
That sounds like a living hell to me today.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.060
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, completely hell. Uh, the,

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.940
yeah, I don't know what else to add to that one. The,

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.420
in fact, I will,

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.940
what other rant do we get back to the other question here?

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.020
Cause we only have like 15,

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:29.100
18 minutes left is some people on the other side of the bubble.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.620
Like again, I'll go back to the one that really triggered people.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.700
I talked about developers being able to do testing.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.500
Still see post people saying, well, I'm in the developer's mindset.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.500
I have to shift gears and change in order to find, to critique my own work.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.300
And yeah, I get that.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.620
But what is missing from a lot of these stories is that creating

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.140
good software is a highly collaborative process.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.100
And yeah, it is a little harder maybe to do your own testing when you're just by

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.020
yourself. But if you make something by yourself, you're probably not,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.050
probably don't have a lot of customers. Uh,

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.530
when you're trying to do something significant,

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.690
it's a collaborative process and that collaboration is, uh,

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.420
where you get the benefit from.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.820
And there's so much in what you said. I want to,

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.860
I want to just go on a rant on the very first statement is I have to shift

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:27.460
to the, the, the, the tester mindset to move forward. That's to me,

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.980
like, why is it phrase that way?

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.540
When I sit down to write a new chunk of code, okay,

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.740
I go through, uh, the TDD process and I say, okay,

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.560
now before I begin, it's, it, to me,

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.440
it's more like a Steven Covey. Have you ever read, ever read Steven Covey?

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.000
Oh yeah.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.880
Okay. Begin with the end in mind. What is the end?

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.920
How can I sit down before even get colored by how the code was written and be,

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.200
you know, no, uh,

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.440
run the risk of not being able to discern the forest from the trees.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.320
According to this, um, this theory is, is, okay, well,

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.440
how do I know if I got there? What's the sunny day scenarios?

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.880
What's the rainy day scenarios?

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.240
What are the tests that I'm going to, to write up first?

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.080
Uh, and then I'm going to write my code to,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.520
to the point where they pass those tests. Okay.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.440
I can get a long ways there. Will I forget about things?

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.240
Will I neglect something on my own? Damn straight.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.520
But that's not because I'm going to developer versus tester mindset.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.200
That whole thing is, is, is bull. And we've,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.080
I think our listeners get that. I don't want to go too far in the echo chamber,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.600
but it's still out there. I wanted to mention it. Did you want to rant some more?

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.640
No, no. So in this one, I'm just like, how much of this,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.480
of this point of view is being solidified because the,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.840
the language choice and,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.120
and how they're presenting it in the first place is just bullshit. Like to me,

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.360
actually you represent this all the time on the podcast. So, and you, you go,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.840
Hey, here's a problem. Here's my definition of done.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.600
This is how far I've gotten. Brent,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.520
do you have any, any additional thoughts on this?

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.520
Like you've probably done it five or six times on this podcast. It's like,

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.500
no, it's,

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.300
it's the value of collaborating and recognizing,

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.460
and maybe that's it, maybe that's it.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.300
Maybe that's my problem with specialists in some of this regards.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.340
Like you and I have encountered this in the, in the old school days.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.060
Like there were teams when I was a test manager that I would go talk to the dev

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:49.300
lead and he would just say, all right, if we have a bug,

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.420
it's test fault because my devs are,

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.980
are five star devs just ask them, right?

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:00.740
And there's this sort of specialization ego that gets

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.140
involved. And, and, and I'm wondering now,

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.460
because I am very much a generalizing specialist or a specialized,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.740
and generalists, one of those things now. And I'm wondering,

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:16.240
am I a lot more collaborative now because I no longer even

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.680
pretend to believe that I frigging know everything,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.180
right? I'm not trying to know everything.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.340
I'm trying to accomplish a goal and I know quite a bit about it,

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.180
but I also know the things I don't know. And you know what?

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.060
I'm going to go ask Alan what his thoughts on this topic is,

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:39.090
or I'm going to go ask Sally what her thoughts are on this one.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:45.380
Because we're better together. Yep. Whole team quality, baby. Yeah.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.020
Maybe you saw this. I saw this on LinkedIn.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.500
Someone was was ranting against whole team quality. Oh, I saw that. And I,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.220
do you have whole team design? Uh, yeah. Yeah, you should.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.660
Do you have whole team performance? Uh, yeah,

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.940
it was, uh, awkwardly, it was just awkward to watch.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.300
It was, it was, it was a little cringy. Okay. Um, I have a question for you.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.820
Different subject, different subject. You promised me something about data. I did.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.820
I did because I ran into an interesting question recently,

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.900
which again, it comes down to framing and the question you and I often ask a

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.500
lot, a lot of people do is, okay, what's the outcome you want?

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.740
Imagine you had this, what are you going to do? The question,

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.940
what was, what was actual question? Uh, Hey, Alan,

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.940
do you have any tips for us? We want to build a data org. Okay. Okay.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.300
What do you want to do? Well,

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:50.580
we want to be able to make a data driven decisions about our business.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.830
Oh, you just,

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.870
you just immediately changed it to shit.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.830
I deal with all of the time. Okay.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.470
So what I want to know is because I'm here today for advice.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.870
Cause the answer I gave him was that I need to think about,

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.670
this a little bit more. If you can give me some more context,

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:20.550
I'll get back to you hoping I could just chat to you about this, uh,

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.890
about this. So the stage I got them in,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.130
they asked me those questions literally. That's what they want to do.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:30.330
They want to be more data driven and building a data org is the answer they

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.170
decided on. And right now the,

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.530
this team is trying to understand, okay, what will this data or do?

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.290
What questions will they help us answer?

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.810
And I feel like I can't put a finger on it,

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:48.450
but I feel like they're starting at the wrong end of the question. Um, yeah,

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.930
I was going to say, uh,

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.690
though just with the questions that you asked me, uh,

00:35:54.770 --> 00:36:00.020
that is absolutely a sign of the tail wagging the dog.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.860
Yeah, I felt that way. I'm checking with you. So, so what do you do?

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.220
Imagine just came to you like,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.980
what are the questions you asked to get the tape to get the,

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.660
to get to the front of the dog?

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.500
I have better metaphor is the underwear norms, right? On this one, right?

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.740
We got data where we're missing step two,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.160
but once we find finished that up, massive profit. Yeah.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.760
Okay. So the first thing they have to unwind is what is a data culture and

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.440
hold on a second. I just rolled over my goddamn headphones.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.160
The, I can imagine I got his pause for a second here. Let me come back is, uh,

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.680
I got to imagine it's like Brent's on a rolly chair rolling around.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.520
I've been sitting on a ball the last month or two. So I can bounce. All right,

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.280
go on to tell me, tell me what, what to tell this team. Um,

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.800
they want to improve the, the, the data culture of the org. Okay.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.940
Correct. So what is, so in my mind,

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.580
I would say, okay, what are the principles that are going to find that?

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.380
And, uh, again, what are the actions? Cause improving,

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.180
like even improving the data culture of the org, that is a,

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.740
like I did that presentation. It's basically, right?

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.180
It's essentially how do we transform? Right. And it's essentially,

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:31.180
what you're trying to do is make quantification a stronger influence than

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.900
intuition on decision-making. Sure.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:40.480
So that like the first thing I would say is they have so much to learn before

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.000
they would even begin doing that. Like it,

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.440
if someone came to me, I would with that question now,

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:53.160
and I would immediately go and say, uh, this needs to stop. Like, um,

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.800
but, but you can't say this needs to stop. They have a,

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.320
they have the right to do it.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.200
They can't say this needs to stop. They have,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.640
they have the right desire in place. Let's go back to the beginning. Right. They,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.320
they want to be more data driven. They want to quantify over intuition.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.440
Those are all good things. We want those things.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.360
So I can't just tell them to go away. I think they're solving that, that they,

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.440
they define their end state. We always have current state. We don't have,

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.950
we were data oblivious desired state want to be data driven. Uh,

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.870
what are the next, what are the right next steps for a team like that?

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.190
So begin with the end of mind, you know,

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.030
what is the single most important in,

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:34.830
and you want me to wind this to the head count. So you're going to need,

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:39.150
like from this, you're going to need a lot of PMS.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:43.230
You're going to need a lot of data engineers.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:48.150
You're going to need developers to buy off on, um,

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.550
telemetry. Am I not going to the right director?

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:54.870
I think so. I, a little bit,

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.390
something I've noticed for years and years and years,

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:01.350
even going back to my time at Microsoft in the early days of a data science,

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.190
some of you may recall,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.750
I actually briefly led one of Microsoft's first data science engineering teams,

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.790
that a science teams when I worked for Chris on the stupid, the stupid thing,

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.630
I ended up giving that I ended up hiring, uh, uh,

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:18.510
Gigi and given him and given him that role. Oh, right.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:22.790
But I did it to hold, to hold things down, but there was an idea.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:27.390
And I see this notion. I hear it a little bit between the lines from this team.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:32.590
And I've seen it before where teams think, okay,

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.350
we just get a bunch of data and then we'll get a data scientist and they'll

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:41.230
just make cool things happen in there. Magic, magical happen.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.070
When, when someone comes to me along these lines, it's,

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.350
it's essentially a belief that all we need to do is hire a bunch of dead

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:53.510
engineers, right? It's essentially build it, and they will come.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.310
Okay. And that's when you came to me, that's what raised in my mind. Oh my God,

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:00.350
this is a building. They will come exercise. Yeah.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:04.550
I think they're starting with what are the questions we can answer with data.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.910
We'll make a big list of those and then we'll hire a team to go make sure we can

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:13.300
answer them, which seems it doesn't, it, I know it's wrong.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.820
What's the alternative? What I can't just tell them, I don't think this is

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.300
wrong. Don't do it this way. Cause then the next question is,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.020
how should we do it? You gotta do, you gotta do a journey, right?

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.580
The, the first thing everybody wants is, uh, I,

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.300
and I don't know what unity uses, but, um,

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:36.980
first thing everybody wants is their pretty little dashboards, right? So it's,

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:42.020
it's having the dashboards there gives proof that the data is there, right?

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:51.220
Um, and, but it doesn't advance the data culture per se.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:57.780
It creates a new bottlenecking team. You'll end up having, uh, you know, five,

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.020
depending on the size of the team, five or six vendor, uh,

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.860
power BI developers,

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.980
then you'll end up having your unfair share of data engineers,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.900
uh, who are spending 50% of their time. I call it data hurting.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.580
It's sort of data, the data version of cat hurting.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:23.300
It's essentially a going through and figuring out where the hell the data is,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.780
because of course there's no, there's no, um,

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.420
formal data engineering structure in play. Like the first thing I would,

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.660
I would hire would be a,

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.700
a business analyst who would come in and absolutely figure out what are the

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.740
actual important business questions to answer.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.340
I would almost start that way. Just hiring a business analyst,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.180
biz, biz dev kind of person to figure out,

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.460
figure out those questions cause they're going to know better.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.700
They're going to know better what they want to solve. So,

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.220
but the thing to keep in mind here also is that I'll bring up is,

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.500
is if they know the questions they want to answer already,

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:11.010
then they can go add the instrumentation so they can answer those questions

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:16.290
where I've seen value from data engineering or data science teams is helping me

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.370
figure out what questions I want to answer.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.530
There are two approaches there, right? It's like,

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:26.730
you're far from a data science space right now. If,

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.610
right, maybe I don't know.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:32.730
Well in my current org got a crap ton of data scientists cause they do all the

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:37.130
modeling and prediction algorithms for our, for our, our advertisement placements.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.290
All right. So that team should be approached.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:45.730
That team should be approached and say, Hey, we want to do this broader.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.700
What's the unity gaps?

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.500
Cause that team's going to understand where the pain points are.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.660
Yeah. For again, this is actually the team. I'm,

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.180
this is the team asking about this, not a unity team. Um,

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.540
so making that connection isn't as easy. Uh,

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.060
and it would be a little bit different. Gotcha. Gotcha. No, no,

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.220
it's not a unity team that, that, that puts it into a different context.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.940
I have gotten, uh, questions before around, um,

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.580
if you hire two people, you want to hire, um, you want to hire,

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.580
um, number one, a business analyst who will,

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:27.020
who's experienced in this and will, we'll go through first and foremost,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.900
what are the questions that the business is trying to answer?

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.140
The second thing you need is a data engineering architect.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:34.770
Cause, um,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:39.810
the biggest slowdown in this space is cleaning the data and even discovering the

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:47.170
data, putting something in place where that data can be curated up front without

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:49.530
turning it into a month.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:55.090
I've seen huge pain points from that when people have gone crazy,

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.690
crazy, where people have gone wild, uh,

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.530
excessive with the data collection with poor schemas in place and just things

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:02.370
are broken forever.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.530
They're broken forever, but then the,

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:08.370
the solution is not to go the other way either. Right?

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:12.250
Cause I've also see, uh, people propose monthly, um,

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.970
multi milestone, uh, big design up front. Oh,

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:18.010
we're going to,

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:21.250
we're not even going to write the first line of code until we have, you know,

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:25.530
figured out the entire perfect snowflake schema for the entirety of the

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:29.970
company. And I'm like, okay. Um, you know, 10 years when you,

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.650
when you failed to achieve that circle back with me,

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:39.400
because basically then where data science comes into play,

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.760
you're right. There are two places for, for data science here.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.040
Number one is the simpler one, which is hypothesis testing.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.160
It are deductive reasoning. And in their earlier phases,

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.880
that's the more in the earlier phases of the company towards this.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.640
That's actually the one I would suggest doing.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.640
It's basically the intuitionists have a belief and you use deductive reasoning

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.800
to, to prove or disprove it.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.080
It helps to get that moving forward. Then when that gets tiresome,

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.560
because you know, after every hundred hypotheses,

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.880
only two to become validated,

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.360
then you want to go into inductive reasoning.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.360
We're using AI and ML to learn the patterns within the data.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.880
And push them up so that someone can, can go, okay,

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.760
is this interesting or uninteresting? Um,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.320
but it all starts on that,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.920
that journey starts on in my mind very clearly with the two bookends.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:47.400
How do we create a solid curation culture of the data and treat the data as if

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.920
it's a product that's that's prob for my experience.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:59.040
That is probably the single hardest challenge is,

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.480
is that the, the, the PM, the dev team, they'll have data,

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.800
but they're not viewing that as a challenge.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.680
And so people are trending stuff or on trying to understand what happened here.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.520
And there's a lot of gaps and holes. And it's not,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.160
from a dev point of view is like, look,

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.580
I'm just sharing my diagnostic feed. If I don't, right,

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.460
don't ask me to turn it into a product. And then I'm like, no,

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.820
that's exactly what I'm doing. It's great that you can,

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:31.260
you can use my data for other things, Brent, um, but it's not a product.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.620
And I'm like, uh, actually it is now.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:38.530
There's a, we need to wrap up. There's a meta point here, which is, uh,

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.130
I think, you know, you and I both get this a lot.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.690
I'm sure a lot of the three do as well. Uh,

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.500
people will ask you how to get started on something they've set up

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.780
fundamentally wrong. In fact,

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:55.340
this question is actually at the meta level is very similar to, Hey,

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.600
I want to get into automation. What do you really want to do?

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.740
I want to build a data team. What do you really want to do?

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:08.890
And even then, and so the five whys is a fantastic tool here.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.540
Like, okay, great. You advance the data culture of the organization.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:18.780
Why does the business care? Yeah. And that's definitely a line of questioning.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.940
I'll get into, um, when I discuss this with these folks that asked me,

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:28.180
I think they'll say, well, we want to improve our business. Why? How? Yeah.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.700
It'll be fun. Uh, okay. Well,

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.140
thank you for helping with that and need a little bit of framing on that.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:37.060
I think it's really just one of those coaching consulting,

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.980
asking a bunch of questions to get people to reflect on what they're really

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.530
trying to do. Uh, but a little bit of context helps me out. All right.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.010
I am late for another meeting. I'm going to get going, but Brent,

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:51.290
as usual, it's been good talking with you on our AB testing podcast.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.450
And, and you as well,

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:58.570
I will talk to you and the three next time.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.910
Awesome. See ya.
