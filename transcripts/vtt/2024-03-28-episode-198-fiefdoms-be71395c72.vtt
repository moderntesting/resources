00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.900
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hello it's Alan oh and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.000
Brent so I was just gonna say hi but then Brent started doing a very like

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.160
imagine the worst possible dad dance ever the white white guy yeah dad doesn't

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.000
know how to dance dance oh yeah there it is again oh god like we are a much better

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.960
podcast hey everybody it's episode 198 of the AV testing podcast and we got

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.400
Brent and his cat here never reason we gotta start if you and I weren't so damn

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.620
ugly we should totally like livestream our podcast I would I mean us being ugly

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.060
is it the blocker number one I mean there's I've seen worse on on YouTube

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.920
number two though this is where it does become a problem like if you're really

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.260
concerned about that like doing the whole like extra editing a video to like

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.470
buzz out the fact that I'm a fatty fat ass from fatty land it just seems like

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.710
more work and in you know low maintenance better oh it's freaking tax

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.560
season and I'm gonna be I'm poor when that happened when I left unity I had a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.420
whole bunch of stock options at a price I could not let expire so I bought them

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.210
all oh now I gotta pay the AMT and all those things yeah I'm still gonna be net

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.530
ahead this is a first world problem I'm just gonna sell some of them because now

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.490
I'm past the tax period I'll get it it is definitely a first world I'm complaining I

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.910
have to give some of my money to the government unlike our our former

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.090
president's fan of states who never have to do anything and be accountable ever I

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.650
have I'm accountable for my funds and my taxes I'm gonna pay them no okay

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.330
we could comment me too me too the only thing the only thing I would say

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.890
is I've had Turbo Tax tell me for multiple years in a row that I should be

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:37.650
doing AMT and I just went no and thus far I haven't had a love letter telling me

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.290
otherwise yay Brent okay all right on with the show here we go here we go we

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.810
have a new segment I do not have a theme song for it but there's it's gonna

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.770
go into a topic I wanted to discuss with you because it involves our time

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.010
together at Microsoft and before and I have a whole arc an arc Brent an arc in

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.850
my head oh in your head okay my head and you're gonna discover as we go the new

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.530
segment I'm gonna write a song for this at some point but the new segment is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:17.050
called what's on Alan's desk okay what's on Alan's desk so a couple things

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.250
like it should be like jazzy yeah I got to work on it my voice is a little better

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.970
yeah I'll lay something down but I bring it up cuz right before we didn't we talked

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.610
actually I loved our last podcast I looked at editing I didn't get like bored

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.210
and mad like yeah I like this topic and then Jason Arbin messaged me from my

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.690
basement on LinkedIn and told me cuz he lives down there apparently and he told

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.690
me like all like he was excited about all the things we talked about and anyway

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.570
because you can do this you just have to do blah hook up the reverse ornithopter

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:05.010
into the subjugated a I am certain you're paraphrasing paraphrasing slightly yes

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.210
yes so and the reason I'm bringing that back cuz last week I would I had how to

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.330
measure anything the wonderful Hubbard book on my desk because I was gonna

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.410
write a blog post about it but I also want to talk to you about it because I

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.850
don't know if we ever talked about that have we talked about how to measure

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:30.250
anything on the pot I am maybe a long long time ago I'm okay whether we have or

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.130
not I have distinct memories of us doing so because it's fantastic okay I

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.850
have another book on my desk that you probably haven't read our books are kind

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.730
of fetish right we've definitely talked about that one right we talked about

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:53.930
that one we talked about Reese we talked about Reiner son's book Nicole is our

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.810
current favorite unless you're about to show me a new no no no this is this

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.450
is an old book but it's relevant I've been thinking about it a lot and I'm

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.810
probably gonna write a blog post about this weekend but I realize there's so

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.610
much I want to talk about some of the transitions Microsoft went to and we can

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.010
talk about what I was there about some of these things and I want to hear some

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.890
of your don't tell me anything you're not allowed to but it's fine I think

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:26.280
okay thank you get where I'm going but before we get there I want to show you

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.360
a couple things well this one doesn't hooked up yet I spent a lot of time

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.960
this weekend mucking around with just setting up a bunch of Docker containers

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.560
to do random crap on my network and I say I have all of my CDs ripped to flak to

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.000
flak lost it's like as think it's like a zip file for a wave it's non it's

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.680
compressed but it's locked completely lossless okay and over time with

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.400
Spotify doing what they do where did you do that like three year three or

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.560
four years ago okay five years ago six years ago I did you know the mp3 yeah

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.920
and I still have them and I'm like okay there's better things now I just don't

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.680
feel like doing it again so I'm not gonna do it again I'm gonna take my CDs and

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.680
try and find out what one does with like 3,000 CDs I also have all of my flak on

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.760
let me know because I have I don't have 3,000 but I have at least 700 when I

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.880
move the time before last I found a couple huge stacks of blank DVDs about

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.040
what the fuck am I gonna do with these so anyway flak backed up to Glacier

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.400
storage cost like $2 a month to keep them all backed up so I will never have

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.800
to record them again but also they sound better noticeably better compared to an

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.520
mp3 and probably half my CD collections unavailable on Spotify so all good and

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.760
I have an old Kindle that I haven't Kindle color thing whatever it's called

00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:00.120
Kindle fire can be fire fire and what I can't do with it is anything because it's

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.400
old and slow and can't be upgraded anymore but I want to see if I can get a use it

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.880
as a controller for one of the I installed a music indexing service and

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.880
then put a subsonic output on it so I can other things so I can play it to my

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.080
Sonos speakers and I want to see if I can make the only thing blocking me now

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.280
is easy access to control and play those so that's on my desk little hacking

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.600
project gonna happen this week oh so you're gonna hack your Amazon fire and

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.720
make it into a zoo we're gonna see we're gonna see but even better if we get a

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:40.560
little deeper here I am recording on my very nice mix pre 3 we used to have you

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.480
coming into track 3 on this over the internet via USB you are now coming your

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.120
own audio track on Riverside FM which I'm very happy with because it allows me

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.560
to do things like this and not only are they recorded for you and I to hear if

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.720
all goes well but it also is recorded right into track 3 so the backup

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.000
recording I'm making has this and it sounds like this

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:18.920
oh yeah awesome so so you are now like even closer to like a real DJ I want to

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:33.450
be a DJ and I'm gonna edit this part out for surprise that's gonna be fun too I

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.970
have absolutely no control I have no idea how many buttons you've implemented I

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:48.330
have it going on it makes me so happy and I can only imagine how happy you are

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:55.880
all of our paid subscribers will be so happy so yeah all right so many other

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.440
things on my on my desk I'm not gonna talk about all of them it's kind of

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.120
what's new so I don't know about you man my desk is like I work here but it has

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.280
the stuff I want to keep in hand like accelerate lean startup lean analytics

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:14.580
writer some book they're all over there but occasionally a book but I it's

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.080
influencing me Brent's trying to distract me find this way to my desk

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.280
because it it means something in the moment okay I don't know if you ever

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:30.360
read this this was written by holy cow in the late 90s 2000s early 2000s okay

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.660
do you remember Bob Herbal why do I know that name he was that that's

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:43.580
someone I know right yeah he was the CEO at Microsoft in the 90s and early 2000s

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:50.920
okay I don't know personally but yeah and before I go on from there I didn't

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.860
know at the time I was young and dumb and new but I can talk it's been over a

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.780
year I don't think there's any NDAs nor anyone cares but when I decided to leave

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:07.780
unity unity was an absolutely fantastic place to work with really really great

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:14.660
people it I just disagreed with the direction the leadership was like I was I

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.900
was leadership the two the two levels of leadership above me our COO and our

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.220
c-suite where we're going in and I'm not gonna go into names of the idiots on

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.540
there but I felt like our CEO John who I really really liked and he was

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.380
really good it was just a little bit again as is me observing from the side it

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.540
was too big for him he was better and smaller org I don't know if he didn't know

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.620
how to ask for help or he got the wrong help but I remember having long

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:49.820
conversations with my boss the CTO saying he John needs a COO an operating

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.420
officer he is he was really good at interfacing with the customers and

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.180
figured out where we're going kind of being a face someone needed to run the

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.020
company it's kind of like what I did for a lot of my managers at Microsoft I would

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.860
say you you you manage the people I'll run your business but anyway yeah that

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.140
aside I didn't know what he did I actually wanted to do this job at you I

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.700
know they've never hired me for it because John wouldn't have hired anybody

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.020
for that job because he didn't want to get the help but anyway seeing it was a

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.340
CEO it made me think about that but the reason I bring him up is he wrote a

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.300
book came out in early 2000s I can't find a date on here so I'm gonna say

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:29.130
early 2000s it's called the fiefdom syndrome I have not read that book not

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.810
many people have and I don't even remember I do remember why I bought it

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.230
and I'm gonna come back to that because friggin the company was riddled with

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:44.230
that shit well it wasn't I was young enough and new enough of my career it

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:49.390
it rang true to me and then when I read the book it's like holy shit and

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.510
some of this comes from Proctor and Gamble and other big companies but a

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.790
couple things I'll talk about while you're typing and looking up I think we

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:01.510
all know it's like I talk about silos often fiefdoms and silos they are from

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.150
the from the book jacket because it's way better than chat GP teaching the

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:10.390
problem begins when individuals groups or divisions out of fear seek to make

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.870
themselves vital to their organizations and unconsciously or sometimes

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.550
deliberately try to protect their turf and gain as much control as possible

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:27.480
over what goes on one it's interesting cuz I'm I I forgot that pockets of this

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.920
exist in the industry I remembered at Microsoft I remember it so well I oh I

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.760
can tell you so many stories in fact I'm gonna tell one bad Microsoft story and

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.520
then I want you to talk to me like I don't quite remember how it got better I

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.360
was involved in some of it but I hurt my shoulder like a long time ago it

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.640
hurt to reach behind me for like a year and then it didn't but I didn't notice

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.920
when it stopped just kind of was gone and maybe I just stopped paying

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.240
attention or maybe I made my own fiefdoms I didn't pay attention I want to

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.840
talk about that a little bit but the story I want to tell around fiefdoms is

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.040
you know one of Microsoft's all-time best programs ever something a

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.280
flagship that they should really hang their hat on is Bob Microsoft SharePoint

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.850
SharePoint still a viable product it's all right let me finish my story I

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:26.290
early 2000 Stack Overflow was going gangbusters they didn't have the whole

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:33.130
Stack Overflow thing in fact way back then they had a business model well they

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:38.130
would set license Stack Overflow to corporations to run as an internal Q&A

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.730
site with all the goodness of Stack Overflow to kind of archive knowledge

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.010
at the time and probably still today you don't have to let me know but at the

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:52.330
time Microsoft had dozens and dozens of thought hundreds of hundreds of DL's

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:59.770
where people discussed everything from Win32 programming to C++ to com to SQL

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.690
Server to blah blah blah special interest groups DL's tons and tons of

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:12.680
them yeah that so that still exists okay so at the time so I thought wow

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.880
because I was a big Stack Overflow fan I was early user I thought we need to get

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.520
that from Microsoft but when I was working in that EE group and I had

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:30.590
autonomy to go talk to them so I did and I I won't say I talked to important

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:36.830
people there and I got us the deal of the century to bring Stack Overflow

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:43.430
into Microsoft and get all that technology here the only worry from our

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:48.830
my senior leadership at that time the only worry was what if because we wanted

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.670
to get it for just let's just use it for these teams and what if everybody uses it

00:14:53.670 --> 00:15:00.430
it's like oh no what if super excited we are down to like we're ready to put

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:06.150
a contract out and and they're gonna fly out and get it set up for us and

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:13.500
some senior leader and SharePoint blocked it he said no everything they're doing

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.940
are features we're going to have in SharePoint someday so we don't want you

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:26.260
bringing this in it's worse it's worse so that was like oh okay and for years I

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.500
had a doc on our intranet people would go to our internal site and they

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.660
emailed me for years going hey this ever what happened this what happened

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:41.060
so not only did they this VP in SharePoint SVP GM whatever he was block our

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:48.780
usage of Stack Overflow they insisted that I cut off my con my my conversations

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.140
with the folks at Stack Overflow completely they made me ghost them I

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.500
couldn't even tell them we weren't pursuing I just had to ghost them

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.340
completely what was the guidance I got if one of the most angry times I've

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.260
ever been in my life and I just want to make a good thing happen for everyone and

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:13.420
I got waylaid by someone trying to build a fiefdom did legal give you that

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:19.300
guidance or was it no no no it came from I don't know where it came from it

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.540
eventually came through me through my boss said this got blocked blah blah blah

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.760
and you are not to say one more word stuff okay well if it came from your

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.100
boss anyway fiefdoms actually I'm gonna shut up for a second cuz I have

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.140
all kinds of stuff from the book I want to bring up but we used to have a lot

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.340
more of those at Microsoft and even in the end when we had we still had

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.420
competition a little bit of backstabbing but I don't remember the fiefdom so do

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.180
you remember what happened to them all or are they still there and I didn't know

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:57.660
oh no there is remnants of them still here but it's now remnants right it's

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:06.140
essentially Satya has slowly but surely chipped at it and it's it's I think

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:12.020
working at Microsoft you wouldn't you wouldn't recognize it nearly as much I

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:19.000
was trying to load up the old-school diagram of like the Microsoft

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.240
communication structure where it's essentially orgs all pointing guns at

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.560
each other yeah yeah that was very famous people it's amazing probably once

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.600
every four or five months someone will send that to me and say have you seen

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.480
this it's hilarious so yeah yeah lived it lived it lived it and glad it's dead

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:50.990
there's still every so often I see it pop up but the number of times I go

00:17:50.990 --> 00:18:00.430
what a bunch of old-school crap right that has rapidly fallen like I think I

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:06.750
have said it twice in the last two years right the idea of collaboration

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:14.850
partnership psychological safety and that is absolutely on the rise what yeah I

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:21.920
didn't know anyone at Microsoft could pronounce psychological safety we do

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:28.720
have the education team I mean what are they doing yeah but if you think about it

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:38.150
back in those days right so number one Bill Gates very famously would give two

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:46.830
entire divisions the same mission right when I first started right exchange owned

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:54.380
email the server and schedule plus make the calendar a nap and I forgot those

00:18:54.380 --> 00:19:03.210
cost of plus anyway go on yeah that was no it's alright it's alright check it out

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:09.020
it's the only remember back in the day when you ship something you got it I

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.580
know I got a Windows Millennium box on my bookshelf over there so the only

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.580
one I kept was schedule plus because that was my I just need to have a bonfire

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:23.620
that was my first anyway back in those days they would literally set up things

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:31.240
number one where where divisions would compete with each other without realizing

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.140
they were competing with each other I remember when it bubbled down it took

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:42.020
like a year before the exchange team learned that even the outlook team had

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:50.250
even been formed we're like what the hell is this crap what's going on right now

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:56.170
where did where does the feet thumbs come from my hypothesis is people are

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:02.370
trying to get control because they're in an incentive model that encourages blame

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:08.290
yeah and that herbal says some of the same things I agree the Wiltsian model

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:16.020
that Steve bomber was in love with right aka the the bell curve model oh yeah

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:22.270
okay that incentive model number one does not work in the software industry

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.310
it was developed for sales team and makes sense in the sales team bomber only

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:37.880
new run sales teams right and so that has caused a lot of harm yeah and and

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:43.320
it's actually still causing harm right I have young kids coming out of college

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.760
like you and I have talked about I think we've talked about I actually

00:20:47.760 --> 00:21:00.000
believe that in high-tech we're going to see overall the the value of high-tech

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.710
skills from a price tag from a salary point of view the supply of people with

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:12.380
these skills particularly with LLM and things like that it's far greater than the

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:18.620
demand and so I I see I expect to see sort of a salary adjustment on that front

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:23.260
over the next let me expand on that I want to get back to fiefdoms and how I

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.340
just a little over how they went away but I think you're on to something there

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:34.980
I think tech skill the technical skills are yeah they're on a path to be

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:40.940
overrated and perhaps overpaid yeah I was talking to someone last week and

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.960
and actually I'm got re-invited re-renewed I'm on the alumni board at my

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.720
own University because I'm a big liberal arts fan and talk about the the how

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.400
important it is to be able to talk to people and influence people and get

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.880
along with people and emotional quotient and I think people with critical

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.560
thinking and high emotional quotient those that's like the new top

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:16.130
knowledge worker at some point I would add one more to that and I almost think I

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:21.740
would put it top of your list you probably have a better way of phrasing it

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:31.200
but I think that the especially told my daughter this I think the jobs of the

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:41.480
future the number one skill set is the ability to learn and apply in the

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.800
shortest amount of time we read that in a whole new mind by pink or I read it in

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.120
a whole new mind by pink talking about the rise of the knowledge worker in

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.440
general because that's what knowledge workers do and good knowledge workers

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.200
have short feedback loops on their learning one of the things I've looked

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:05.010
for for decades now in hiring is not your ability Google to sort a binary

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:10.330
tree while standing on your head drinking a jar of Kool-Aid it's the it's the

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.890
passion for learning yeah like 100% if you look at I've you know I was a in

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.690
Microsoft I've hired you know a thousand people whatever maybe maybe

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:22.330
less but a lot a lot of people the ones that I got to follow like the people

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.770
who were definite hires for me it's like I would ask questions try and gauge

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.130
their passion for learning like and then the canonical example I use I

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.090
probably told us on a podcast once but I look for the things on your resume that

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.930
aren't tech because by the time you get to me you've had the tech questions I

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.970
say oh you're interested in photography cool tell me a little bit about that oh

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:46.890
I like to take pictures with my phone and I saved them and sometimes I send

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:52.020
them to my family that's answer one I go oh that's great a little bit a

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.780
little bit sarcastic and I get person number two I said well tell you about

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:01.340
that and they say oh I really got into it last year and I got this I learned

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.260
about this camera talk to a friend so I went to this internet site I learned

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:09.100
this and this I do this as I go to I organized a photography critique once a

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.620
week we meet in each gorgeous photos we try and find different ways to improve

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.700
them I do this and that's like like okay that person is going to be

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.380
successful in any field of knowledge work the fact that you're a kick-ass

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:27.300
programmer to come join my team come today tomorrow right yeah right next to

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:33.150
me it's amazing success rate those people they're there they don't they

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:42.330
don't flame out and dud they crush it I I have I have a new employee on my team

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:48.730
relatively was the newest and I don't know if she still listens but when she

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:54.050
joined the team for she was listening the podcast a great deal so if you're still

00:24:54.050 --> 00:25:03.030
listening hi Katie okay she joined the team and Microsoft started this new type

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:10.200
of interview style and it is literally off of potential we literally do not

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.080
care if you know anything I don't know the questions but she got hired through

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:21.040
this potential process very cool she she how come you fixed all the broken stuff

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.560
that nobody gave his shit about after I left just ask him ask him for a friend

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.960
anyway go on maybe you were the final straw that where sure that company

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.560
realized yeah that's what happened oh my god we lost Ellen we need to make a

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:43.990
change she came in she has a PhD in cognitive science like she literally was

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:54.450
doing brain surgery on rats as part of her doctorate and postdoc work okay and

00:25:54.450 --> 00:26:01.570
she has a bunch of fun stories about that process I just I'm enthralled by it I'm

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:09.210
fascinated by it okay now she did some stats work for her PhD I don't know how

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:14.210
many PhDs you can get and not at least do some stats work but really didn't

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:20.570
know much about that a science does not know much about development but she is

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:29.130
hungry to learn and the one thing that I got into her very quickly and and this

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.690
is something where a lot of the PhD candidates I've talked to they struggle

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:40.470
with this I got her to understand very quickly that ideating in academia is

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:52.440
well praised ideating but not executing an industry is is a coffin nail in the

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.960
coffin and that's a common trap PhDs fall into and they come in it is so

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.880
kudos on you have a call on that outfit based on what you told me already I

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:10.040
don't think it would be an issue it really isn't like there was a couple of

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.520
times I'm like hey you're doing it like let me give you and so I had to like

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.000
observe her see what she was doing and and make adjustments and say look you can

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.600
do like what you as an example she's like okay I don't know what I want to execute

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.480
so I want to explore a bunch of stuff and I said how about this you just pick

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.680
one close it think about the things that you're exploring and then you can

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:49.460
iterate fast feedback loop and and she's she's starting to do that and it's it's

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:58.150
just fantastic she's I view her as a as a long-term investment and the more

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:04.870
knowledge and and how to do things I can stuff between her ears the better this

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:11.910
company is going to be in the long run I am now I am now having her entirely own

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:21.340
an entire service by my team but and with which involves code and it's ML back

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:28.060
and including like the deployment in and into production which passed has to go

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:34.780
through all of these security bars right and she just joined us this August I

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:40.100
think only two years TLDR Brand has an awesome new employee hired on potential

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.860
rather than lead code so you brought up something in there that I want this is a

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:50.100
point I wanted to get to but you also mentioned it long-term investment growth

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.860
here's my worry I listen to the Daily Show not not the good one at night the

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.820
podcast because he's called the daily and last week they had an episode talking

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.820
about the growth the aging workforce and how 20 years ago people weren't

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.940
working into their 60s but now with longer life expectancies people are

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.180
gonna work till they're older and who knows if I will or not but got me

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.540
thinking about me I thought no I mean I may but here is the challenge the

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:25.840
problem is and Satya was a 10 out of 10 hire from Microsoft but I would talk

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:32.960
about John at Unity he was very much old-school RTO some stuff he's very

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:40.520
very strict on I worry I worry that some of the things that herbal talks about

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.400
getting rid of fiefdoms he's like you know clear goals transparency

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:49.640
psychological safety engagement you know learning the things that are important

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:57.190
to growing a great org are not in the wheelhouse for like if you look at larger

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:04.030
companies they're I mean even Satya's late 50s early late 50s but he's he's an

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:09.550
exception he has a high growth mindset yes what I worry about is companies

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:16.550
across the board but I worry that they're going to have CEOs who are going

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:21.550
to work into their 60s and 70s I and they will stick let me finish here and

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:27.870
they will stick to their old guns and do stuff the old way when honestly I want

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.950
this is like this is the whole thing with the president I want a freaking 45

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:38.150
year old president I want a 40 year old CEO there are people capable of doing it

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:44.350
I want people with new ideas and about how these new knowledge workers we

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.270
talked about earlier and what we need from them I want people who get that

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.670
leading the companies but I don't think we're gonna get that in my lifetime I

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:59.930
how do I want to say this on recorded podcast let's try it this way sometimes

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:05.010
I just say it and because I own the editing I think I just fix it later

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:10.610
you're like oh no I didn't say it that way I actually said it this way yeah I

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:23.960
I think I talked about it on so DNI like I'm a huge supporter of DNI a huge

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:30.600
supporter of diversity and inclusion who's gonna say they're not well so

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:37.080
here's the thing I get what you're saying but go somewhere so the the

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:43.160
diversity and inclusion right I went and looked at the research okay and

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:51.120
shocking the research does not show that it has anything to do with what body

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:57.760
parts you have or don't have what color your skin is or isn't or in this

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.890
particular case your age what the research shows is that people with

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:11.760
certain body parts show a characteristic okay and it's that characteristic that

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:18.920
matters okay so for example there's a specifically women women who companies who

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:27.240
have women CEOs dramatically outperform companies that don't zero percent

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:33.210
surprised now the question is is why and one of the big characteristics is

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:40.970
that women generally number one arm are more cautious around risk whereas men

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:46.410
generally you're gonna see them we are going to bet the farm on this like I am

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:51.210
never working for that guy again that person who's like we are going to bet the

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:57.850
farm take the hill I'm never working for that idea okay the and I've worked

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:04.680
through many of them Brian Valentine women are also more collaborative they

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:11.560
value more of a partnership right and so sure if you want to improve your your

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:18.440
company and you don't and you don't want to do the hard work sure go by body

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:25.780
part that fine but the thing is it's higher the collaborator higher the someone

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:34.900
that doesn't make artificial hyperbolic tic visions we will win blah blah blah

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.740
right and on my age aside like the thing you're talking about it bothers me

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:47.020
because I'm like okay like you don't want the 40 year old person what you

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:57.660
want is the guy that is just masterful on the growth mindset yes and and what

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:03.260
I'm saying is you're absolutely right what I'm saying is my hypothesis is is they

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.220
do not have like the odds of me finding a growth mindset and a 40 year old are

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:14.220
much higher than a 65 65 year old white dude that's my hypothesis okay go run

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:19.820
the data and what I would say is yeah I'm still not willing to use that as a

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:26.180
heuristic I would rather spend the extra time and say okay if we're going to do

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:31.660
something like that like and honestly I think it would potentially make a lot of

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:42.010
sense because I will say I absolutely think for example corporate heads inside

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:47.610
of China which is something I think about in terms of a competitive high-tech

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:54.570
environment I think they in general are much more growth mindset then okay then

00:34:54.570 --> 00:35:00.330
the tech CEOs here in the United States I just it's in my position obviously like

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:04.650
a hundred and fifty years older than everybody on my team but I look at the

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:09.410
the one-on-ones and meetings I have is kind of a reverse mentorship at least

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:16.610
partially I learned like I get so much hope from people that embrace growth and

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:24.580
love to learn and and I don't get that I use the unity example it's like being

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.380
stuck in your ways like I'll tell you about a conversation I had you'll love

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.700
with the different exec at the previous company sorry I know people from unity

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.860
lists I'm not love the company didn't like where it went and I'm picking on

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.980
you it's just you do you I had a conversation like this I was right before

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:47.020
a bunch of layoffs happened I was involved in a discussion to experiment

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:53.040
with the four-day workweek there is a bunch of data showing it works nobody's

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.720
ever done it with the big company and I get it and I did this because we're gonna

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.920
weave our way back to the people to know eventually I did this because at

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:07.720
Microsoft as you know Brent you're you don't stop accruing vacation ever it just

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.600
cuts off at the end of the year whatever your max is you can only carry over your

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.400
max maybe that's changed don't don't don't wreck me here what I didn't realize

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.080
is that when I went to unity you would get to a point anytime during the year

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.840
if you had your max vacation accrued you just didn't earn vacation so I was

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.520
like not getting vacation while I was working I was at my max and screw this

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.520
guy takes vacation days it's a pandemic I got nowhere to go so I took like every

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:41.200
Friday off for July and August and there's some reasons that that was not as

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.480
good as it should have been because my team and teams around me were working on

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.920
those days for some work was piling up but I got more done in those eight weeks

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.080
than I probably did at almost any other time because a couple things happen

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.360
one is you know you're only working four days you focus and bear down a little

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.280
bit more but that's barely it that's maybe that most 10% of the productivity

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.760
the amount of extra productivity you get from it it's not that the four day work

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.920
week it's the three day weekend every week and planning on that one day to

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.760
rest one day to get shit done one day is for a mentally prepared so anyway I

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.400
loved it pitched it a bunch of people were excited about there's a channel

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.320
we're talking about it I had an idea for a pilot pilot I convinced HR I didn't

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.320
know what it meant we talked through it okay we're gonna do this then things got

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.760
weird with layoffs a bad idea but I presented all this data this is a long

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.800
story didn't even this I didn't even need to tell and probably thought in his head but I

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.640
we had an exec with a huge background in data and he said oh you just sort of

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.520
flat out 40 work weeks don't work I said what about all the data supporting

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.040
it he goes oh I don't believe that data okay well there you go I'm lost this is

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.560
critical thinking to anytime if you present Brent if you tell me something

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.520
I don't believe in I'm not gonna want stupid you tell me actually if you look

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.680
the sky is always brown I go oh well I think you're wrong but I'm gonna go do

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.560
some research to figure out why you think that way and maybe there's a

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.680
like maybe there's a condition maybe there's something that anytime I get

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.520
data that I have cognitive dissonance I am driven to go figure out where that

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.000
motivation for you to tell me this obviously wrong thing is coming from and

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.360
sometimes I find out that I'm the wrong person and an unwillingness to do

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:31.560
that is unhealthy for leaders you cannot so your hypothesis the way I think of it

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:40.650
is you cannot have a growth mindset in an active confirmation bias simultaneously

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:46.810
I think if that's your hypothesis I think I agree okay right it's it's people who

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:52.930
who well I have all this data well I just don't believe it well can I see it

00:38:52.930 --> 00:39:00.050
like I will tell you I will tell you like an event that happened happened the

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:06.250
other day so I've been there's a certain set of like Azure white

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:11.240
strategic strategy meetings that I often get called in and this time I got called

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:18.360
in and they're like hey we want to make this change on this KPI we want to push

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:24.440
this out we want to understand what what you think and I started off with okay

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.880
well I don't have this data can someone give me a histogram and they were like

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:37.840
the hell like to them which is mostly program managers but to them that that

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.770
was like you like an out-there question like what and I saw the histogram the

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:48.170
histogram looked exactly what I expected it to look like and so I asked

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:55.980
them to do a transformation on this and then I was like oh look at this and I

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.740
walked through and I said this is what this is saying this is what this is

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:04.900
saying I very transparently was a data whisperer this is what this means this

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.020
is how you handle it this is why I'm suggesting this and I walked through my

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.740
answer their question but it is a long term okay I found out today that at

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:20.540
least one of the PM's who is very data savvy he just hasn't learned it like

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.430
this happened a week ago and he's still freaking talking about it today he's like

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:29.950
oh that thing they put like it was like I gave him a brand new toy at Christmas

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:35.630
which I did by the way because this is very lightweight it's very approachable

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:43.920
and I'm like we need more of those people those people that listen and

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.080
can think for themselves and learn the technique and apply it to new things and

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:54.880
less of the intuitionist like I have been here forever right now that I've done

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.560
this for 20 years I know what I'm doing son yeah if if you're if your tenure is

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:06.400
part of your title it's time for you to go right if your qualification is purely

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:14.600
measured it's it's not it a growth mindset is it's got its pros and cons

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:22.650
like I'll tell you so I actively have a growth mindset I invest in things and I

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:28.370
will tell you sometimes there are years where none of them land and you know

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:36.260
what we're valued on the results that we've brought and I accept that okay but

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:45.220
when they do land they land major okay and it's okay it's okay it's yeah I'm not

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:54.420
gonna get awesome reviews every time but the fear of oh I am going to get blamed

00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:01.500
and therefore I am going to get into the the shit score in the bell curve and

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:08.740
then fired and then I and my family is all going to be homeless living in a box

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:17.610
next to the 7-eleven right that's not effective driving productivity when

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.810
Microsoft did it in those worlds that beat them mentality helping you to circle

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:27.130
back to the yeah and you and you were there a second ago yeah I'm going back

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:38.410
the world of that beat them mentality back in those days Microsoft I swear to

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:45.690
God this is true from my experience on a day-to-day basis we spent at the ground

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:53.890
level far more of our time competing with each other then competing with our

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:59.370
competitors yeah and there's a famous Simon Sinek story he talks about he went

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:04.730
to visit Microsoft some you know the leadership off-site and they spent the

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:10.160
whole time talking about talking about how they were gonna beat their

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.320
competitors it's adjacent what you said he went to an Apple went to an Apple

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.600
similar meeting and they spent all day talking about how they were going to

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:26.640
please the customer and yeah it's not vibes so what's interesting so I you're

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.760
absolutely right that this fear of failure this fear of blame is this I gotta

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.320
make myself important is where a thief terms come from I'm not gonna hypothesize

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.600
about Satya but herbal talks about like the solution to fiefdom is pretty

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:50.200
simple clear organization wide goals and leaders are on point to foster a culture

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.200
of collaboration yeah and which is we all have our principles around that but

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.560
psychological safety is part of it to give people room to experiment room to

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:05.160
talk and room to fail room to learn number one I really like what you just

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.320
said and I'm wondering if there's some sort of maturity model there like

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.240
gotta help Lois Lois is you're competing internally within your own company to

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:20.960
you're competing externally to me it does feel like it's a better approach to

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:27.440
say hey look let's figure out how to make the customer happy right it because

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:33.240
we the problem with like competing in this happened in the incentive model if

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.640
you and I were competing with each other no I don't need to be good I just

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.250
need to convince others that you were worse absolutely 1 million percent yes

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:50.690
and when you go after okay how do I get customers to love us no now you're

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:58.020
changing the bar you have to be good it not not just the least sucky I like

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:06.840
that there's one last thing that I was in a meeting that so I attend a lot of

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.960
meetings nowadays with with senior executives and I was with one this was

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:17.680
four or five years ago before COVID that was Scott Guthrie do you know who that

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:24.250
is yeah yeah okay and he made a statement that I think about every week

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:30.770
literally it has stuck with me and and I may actually circle back with him and I

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:35.090
said you probably said this out of hand I may circle back with him and just ping

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:45.180
him on it he's like I want to be the apple of the cloud and I'm like that is a

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:52.210
rallying cry I can get behind right I love that idea and just real quick a

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:56.810
rallying cry or that's this is where Andy Groves they're talking about OK

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.770
ours and we can't use OK ours anymore because if they've been so

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:03.690
corporatized and tool eyes they've lost their entire meaning but all it means

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:08.490
is the organization agrees on what's important along with some measurements

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:12.130
on how they know if they're making progress towards that get cool I'm not

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.970
gonna walk through the exercise is be the apple of the cloud because that's

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:20.690
great I mean it helps people align if you can have a clear message on what's

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:26.130
important and the team aligns around it you're gonna have fewer fiefdoms the

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:30.250
problem with something big like be the apple of the cloud right that's up I

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.530
was gonna do a whole workshop there we don't have time for that man I just want

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:39.130
to talk about fiefdoms I think we did that we told some stories that some were

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:43.170
sort of relevant to that and some were just made up shit that someone skipped

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:49.610
through plus 30 seconds plus 30 seconds right and I will say I mean just like

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:55.180
what we've talked about with modern testing right the new world is better

00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:01.860
than the old world the new world is gonna be so much better yeah it's no it is the

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.580
new the current world better than the old world the new world as long as you

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:15.160
know what about the new new world yeah it's we'll figure that man we will we

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:21.080
will we will oh all right let's call it let's call it I am still Alan and I am

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.540
not see you next time
