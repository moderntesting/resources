00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.640
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.340
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.580
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.380
Now on with the show.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.040
Hello everyone.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.360
Welcome to the AV testing podcast.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.680
I'm Alan.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.800
He's Brent and this is episode 200 and something.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.300
That correct?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.340
What do you think?

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.840
17.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.380
We are once again, so prepared.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.860
I want to know your name too.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.020
And we are the name episode 217 and it is, it's Brent.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.340
Yeah.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.560
There we go.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.380
All right.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.420
Well, here we are again.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020
We've been, uh, you know, doing our thing, which we've done forever,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.700
which really has no point.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.220
It's just two guys sitting around drinking beer, virtual beer,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.580
because I don't have a beer in front of me.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.740
And we're talking about software leadership, whatever comes to mind.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.360
And sometimes it's, um, video games, streaming television, but Brent,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.940
how you been, man?

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.280
What's up?

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.790
Oh, doing all right.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.510
Let me show you something that I can't wait.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.070
Just recently.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.470
I'm just saying it's a clock.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.590
It's a ceiling vent.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.270
It's, oh, it's this 25 year crystal thing.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.090
That's my 25 year right next to my 30 year.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.050
Oh, mother of God.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.550
Yeah.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.590
When did I start at Microsoft?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.210
So I started, I would be coming up on year 30 if I was there, but I'm not there.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.290
You're not.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.930
That's true.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.210
I have gone on to different things since then and learned a lot, which if you're

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.450
a long time listener, you will know because we've been doing this podcast for 150 years.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.290
I wasn't even born yet when we started this podcast.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.000
No.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.600
And then I came like what, 10 years after that.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.320
Yeah, somewhere.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.920
Yeah.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.400
Yeah.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.920
All right.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840
Well, congratulations.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.440
Thank you.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.120
Can you get a huge cash prize of that?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.360
Or they still give you like 30 shares of stock with that?

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.450
No, you only get stock with the 10.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.250
That's it.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.850
That's it.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.650
I can't remember.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.610
I forgotten all the awards.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.890
Um, five.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.480
Do you still use head track 10, 15?

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.880
Shut up.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.560
Shut up.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.120
Do you still use head tracks?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.760
Um, has it been changed?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.240
Same thing that existed 30 years ago.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.120
Uh, here, I'll try it out right now.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960
You don't have to try it right now.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.200
No, it makes for great podcast material.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.760
No, it doesn't.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.720
What I found is when I refer to HR systems, I still find myself saying head tracks

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.840
once in a while and, uh, yeah, head tracks is this old.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.920
Yeah, it's still running.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.640
All right.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.040
Good for that.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.200
Hasn't been migrated to the cloud.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.960
It's still like running internal.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.000
Of course it is.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.400
Um, yeah, of course it is.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.280
All right.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.320
That's fun.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.650
Well, here we are.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.450
We're back again.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.530
Um, any, I don't think I have anything exciting to tell yet.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.970
Maybe later in the podcast.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.410
Uh, we'll do the pre-roll filler in the middle.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.740
So did you have anything before we got into our first topic for the day?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.800
I may, I have a couple of things that are not nearly as interesting.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.880
Tell us, tell us, tell us, uh, just three days ago, I turned double nickel.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.200
All right.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.320
And that's old.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.560
It is.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.740
And it, but it also means, um, Oh, I don't know what

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.420
the color of the work, but I hit tenure or whatever that magic thing is.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.780
You can, you can, you can leave and you get to keep your invested options,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.500
which is really cool.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.620
I did not stay that long either.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.060
I blew it.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.300
I'm my financial planning.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.090
Um, actually my, my, my mental health surpassed my financial planning.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.650
I will be much better off if I stayed, but I probably also be dead.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.290
So, you know, and then the other thing on, on just totally like, um, just slight

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.010
proof that I don't entirely lack of life.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.010
Oh, it's going to be huge.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.570
It's for me, it's major.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.000
Um, I think we're waiting.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.070
So myself, my daughter and one of her better friends on, um, Slurpee day

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.970
seven 11 will be seeing, uh, some yacht rock band.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.610
I know it is.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.880
MCR and violent films.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.960
Oh, cool.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.920
MCR for those who aren't total geezers.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.400
Uh, no, actually it's the total geezers.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.280
I don't know what MCR is my chemical romance.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.360
I, I, that's a good, I knew what you're talking about.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.720
And it'll be like my first concert.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.920
My, it'll be her, my daughter's first concert ever.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.640
It'll be my first concert.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.400
Last time we went to a concert was before kids.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.440
Oh my God.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.160
Yeah.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.520
Yeah.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.880
Um, I go fairly often.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.280
Um, not super often, but I love live shows.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.680
I'm going to see a band you never heard of the kids.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.720
No, I'm going to see the Linda Linda's next week, week after next at the showbox.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.520
I do know one of my favorite bands because you mentioned it as one of your

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.000
favorite bands, like three or four.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.000
Oh, very cool.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.080
They're, they're fun.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.880
Just garage punk ish pop punkish.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.280
I don't know.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.600
Okay, cool.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.600
Anything so nice.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.400
Nice to be out of a life.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.360
Um, cool.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.320
Anything else?

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.960
No, I went to New York last week.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.400
That was fun.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.040
Didn't do anything exciting.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.520
All right.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.480
Let's let's talk about your topic.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.720
Okay.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.680
Here we go.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.440
So is it a mailbag from Brent?

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.840
Should I play the mailbag sound?

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.970
If you're going to answer it entirely.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.610
Sure.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.650
Let's talk about, cause you brought it up.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.770
So in our pure, 100% professional planning, Brent said, I think I have something to

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.570
talk about and he said, do you have an answer to this thing?

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.890
I said, no, but I'll talk about it.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.570
He said, cool.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.250
It's on the show.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.570
You liar.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.730
You told me you had an answer to it.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.610
The answer is trying.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.890
Oh my God.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.570
You're just like every PM I work with vaporware vaporware.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.890
You're like, Oh, how dare you?

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.850
If you, if we were still at the same room, fighting words, I'd be throwing

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.130
markers and erasers at you.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.130
All right.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:37.740
Um, one of the challenges that, that I am currently facing.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.760
Okay.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:47.160
And this has to do with it's a downstream impact of COVID.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:56.250
So there's a lot of these things, but, um, before COVID, right.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:06.720
Hardly any remote work being done after COVID, um, like my company realized,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.280
Oh, wait a minute.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:16.240
If we allow hybrid, we could save a butt load on, on leases.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.920
Right.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.280
Move.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.080
Yep.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:29.090
The, however, what is there is a wacky combination of hybrid

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:39.030
so, uh, most of my team, I would say, so I managed a team of, of, uh, 10 now.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.270
So 10 plus me is 11.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.830
Thank you.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.570
And four of them are remote.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.080
Okay.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:57.210
And all in my four remote people, they're in, they're in the US, but all of them

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.600
are in different states, like multiple hours apart.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:12.330
And one of the things that's, that's, that's happening is the benefits, the,

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.010
the energy around people working together.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:26.390
Um, I'm just not seeing it like I did prior to COVID.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.230
Right.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:36.160
And so now we have, it's very difficult to, Oh, and it's not just teamwork.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.440
Cause the, you've, you've seen my, my presentation of how I walk people through

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:53.020
agile and, and what this has a tendency of doing is creating strong collaborative

00:08:53.020 --> 00:09:00.970
connections that begin to extend beyond the professional, like they, they

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.810
start creating friends now.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.000
Excuse me.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.110
So, okay, dude, I don't edit anymore.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.950
So just, just, you have, you have to be good at this 217 episodes, actually

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.190
216 for you because we skipped you on one, but come on, man.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.550
Let's go.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.870
Yeah.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.430
Okay.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.790
Sorry.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:28.910
I muted so I could cough my, um, lungs out the gap.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:36.040
Now from management, the teamwork obviously has positive goals

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.800
cause the teams that collaborate together get more productive.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.320
Okay.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:41.800
Sure.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:50.560
But the thing that I had really well prior to COVID, um, and I don't know

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.960
why it's taking me so long to realize, yeah, it's not coming back unless I take

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:02.420
action, um, the teamwork was a huge source of employee engagement.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.060
Yeah.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:03.940
Right.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:10.340
And it reminded me, I was sharing this, uh, with a mentee just yesterday.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.290
And I paused and I'm like, Oh, I have a topic for my podcast this week.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:23.100
Anyway, um, Gallup did a poll years ago around employee engagement.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:33.440
And one of the things that they found was a, just a massive predictor of.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.310
Do you have high engagement at your, in your business or your work?

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.750
Right.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.910
And it was just simply this, do you have a best friend at work?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:53.090
That question answering yes is a high predictor.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.330
That's interesting because I've spent a lot of time looking at the Gallup data.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.850
And I did not see that one.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.690
Um, most of the research shows that the biggest predictors or

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.970
engagement are three things.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.450
Does your manager care about you?

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.290
Do you know why your job's important?

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.450
Are you getting feedback?

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:08.810
Actionable feedback.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.890
Those, those things are drivers.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.130
If you, if you nail those things, you have engaged people and the engagement

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.090
is measured more directly by things like, would you recommend this as a great place

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.960
to work, but I haven't heard the best friend one yet because, um,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.040
well, actually, so I'm, um, I don't know how long ago that study was.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:36.620
Um, cause it was, I saw a long list of, they would ask, I think 12 or 20 questions.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.460
I don't remember, but does your manager care about you?

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.780
I think it's very similar to that best friend thing.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:45.620
Okay.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:45.980
Sure.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:46.660
Right.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.260
You want, you want to feel like you're taking care of it.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.940
It goes, it plays with a hierarchy of needs.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.300
Sure.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.940
Sure.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:01.010
Um, and my folks that are remote, right.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:08.240
That really, the manager cares about you is really the closest I can get to helping

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.640
those employees answered.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.200
Do you have a best friend at work?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.520
So let me, I want to start to answer this because it's a common thing.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.080
And even before COVID, my team was in seven, seven different countries all over

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.520
the place.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.000
So I thought about this a lot and it, uh, it's really up to you.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.000
This is on the manager because you have to create an environment where

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.560
collaboration can happen.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.360
And there's a bunch of things you can do for this.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:42.070
It takes like, I would say 90% of the managers in tech, okay, maybe 80 are

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.150
just fricking lazy.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.670
They don't do enough to take care of their employees and drive that

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.950
engagement we were just talking about.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:54.520
Uh, so with remote workers or workers not in the same office, as a lot of

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.100
companies have, it takes a lot of effort from the manager because one, you

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.940
need to create opportunities for collaboration.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:06.540
So what if, you know, entropy would say that in a, or where everyone's

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.540
remote people, people would tend to work siloed.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.380
I bet those is a good chance that those four people who work completely

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:19.260
remote tend to get siloed into areas of expertise, um, air areas of things

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.660
they do by the things they're really good at.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.220
So they just do autonomously and independently far away.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.900
Now, as you know, bottlenecks are bad.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.300
You know, your specialization is a career limiting factor.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.780
But also career growth stagnates because those folks, if they're just

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.700
doing their thing and they're doing it in a little, little teeny silo,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.660
their career growth stagnates too.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.700
It's a, and that is also your responsibility as a manager.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.700
So, uh, a couple of things you need to do, and these aren't answers here,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.740
but I think it's a new world and we need managers who can constantly

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.580
experiment in trying to solve this stuff.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.660
So part of it is collaboration.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.180
So I know in your rituals, you're getting them involved in, you know, the teams.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.140
I'm sorry, Microsoft, you have to use teams.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.060
Uh, but I'm, there's teams calls are on, they're working on stuff together,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.820
but, and I know you encourage pairing and, you know, pairing these folks

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.140
different, you know, get them to know other people through pairing.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:22.770
Um, one thing that I did, I kind of fell off my radar and the current job,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.970
I did at unity a lot, especially during the pandemic was I wanted to recreate,

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.490
um, like you're talking about friends and the problem with being on teams all the

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.130
time with every meeting is on teams and not in person is all you ever talk about

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.570
as work, nothing else.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:42.370
And with as many meetings as people have on their calendar, the last thing you

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.410
want to do is let's put a meeting on the calendar where we shoot the shit.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.270
I tried to do like a Friday brain break meeting, uh, at the current job.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.830
Did you ever get that to work ever?

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:53.630
What?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.950
That that, so we've done that.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.510
Like, no, no, let me, let me finish.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.950
Let me finish.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.150
So I tried like a Friday brain break here.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.030
Let's let's let's have everybody get here and we'll play games for a half hour,

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.150
45 minutes on Friday.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.950
People like, no, I don't, I have too much to do.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.910
I don't have the time to socialize.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.020
So you're in meetings.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.500
People over talk about work.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.500
They never get a chance to know each other.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.820
They don't find their common interests without common interests.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.140
They don't discover people they're friendly with, let alone friends or

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.740
best friends.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.260
So a couple of things.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.790
The easiest one is, and you probably do this when you're having one of your

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.790
ritual meetings, take not, not even five, two minutes, ask people with it

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.190
another weekend, find out who cooked.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.190
What's the weirdest food you ate this weekend?

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.990
What's the most, what's the weirdest food you've ever eaten?

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.990
Just ask them questions like that.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.190
Get them talking a little bit and then get onto the work.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.390
But more importantly, because people, sometimes people are awkward there.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.390
They just go, I just want to go over my status branch.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.430
Don't make me be weird.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.070
I'm introverted.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.350
The thing I did at Unity that was super effective in my brain at least,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.950
was I started a question of the day channel.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.430
It was in Slack because we were a superior company to Microsoft.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.590
You can use Teams as well.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:06.470
And I just made this public question of the day channel and every day I would

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.310
ask a question and the question could be something who is your favorite

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.550
manager ever, or it could be what's the weirdest food you've ever eaten?

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.070
Or what video games are you playing right now?

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.710
Or I like a huge video game.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.910
Or I like a huge long list.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.710
I just, it was easy to come up with them.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.670
I asked a new one every day.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.870
I invited my team to the channel to start, but by the time I left there

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.950
about four or 500 people in this channel with, you know, a hundred

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:39.550
people actively answering every day and people, a bunch of lurkers watching.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.870
So what that created was the water cooler, the kitchen, the coffee machine.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.590
So instead of it, it was async, which was nice.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.310
It generated a way for people to learn about each other, which was nice.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.150
And it didn't add to their schedule.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.990
They could look at it.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.790
And we had, again, where I'm across every time zone in this team.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.270
I had everybody all the way from Singapore to Helsinki.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.510
So it let people answer at a time that was convenient to them.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.350
And then people would connect.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.110
There'd be discussions.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.470
Oh, Hey, I love that movie too.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.630
And people would connect and get to know each other.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.510
And then when they had to work together, it was a lot easier for them

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.310
to develop trust to work with each other because they already knew

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.590
a little bit about each other.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.070
It, it like any community.

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.390
And you know, Brett, I did this because I'm a community builder.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.070
Like any community, it took a lot of nurturing and prompting.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.590
Like I would ask people on my team, Hey, go answer this question.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.510
So we get a couple of answers in here and you have to really cultivate.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.430
But it was self-sustaining when I left.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.310
I don't know if it still exists today, but a year after I left that

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.470
question of the day channel still existed.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.830
And it's a great way to get people talking.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.590
Who asks, did you ever hand that off?

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.030
I did.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.630
I actually looked for volunteers sometimes for vacations or whatever, but it took me

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:57.030
a grand total of six minutes a week to come up and ask, come up with and

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.070
ask the questions every day.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.670
So I just did it.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.150
I had a little reminder every morning to post a question.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.830
I forgot maybe once or twice the whole time, but it was pretty easy to do.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.510
It was part of my routine, but it was one way to get people to learn from

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.390
about each other, because you have to find with remote teams, you have to foster

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.470
ways for them to connect where they're not just talking about work.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.350
And then leverage that to find ways for them to work together.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.790
You can't let your remote employees just do a thing in a silo.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.750
You got to get them working with each other.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.310
I want you two to go work on this.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.950
I want you to review this or whatever.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.990
Again, part of the manager's job is to sort of guide people to

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.940
orchestrate the team, not just give them work, but orchestrate and say,

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.100
this will work better if you two work together on this or this thing

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.620
that you're doing, Frank, maybe Sally should do that.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.540
So you can work on this thing that Greg is doing.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.460
And you just have to do a lot more of that.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:57.740
To me, it requires a lot more deliberate management in order to get this to work.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.940
And I know you can do it.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.640
And I just worry, what I worry about not talking to you because you'll try

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.960
all this stuff and you'll figure out what works, what really bugs me about

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.840
remote teams is that so many managers are just managing the work.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.440
They're not managing the people.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.400
And I think managing the people takes 10 times more effort on remote teams.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.480
And we're going towards the end of tech here.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.280
We are a bunch of folks are managed in a way where they have no career growth,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.590
no, no friends at work.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.870
Engagement will drop to the ground and they'll just go work

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.950
at Starbucks or whatever.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.280
I don't think Starbucks is a bad place.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.240
No, I don't think so either.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.120
I just, I just, I just threw it out.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:43.320
Sorry.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:43.960
Yeah.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.280
If I offended anyone from Starbucks, I'm very, very sorry.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:53.940
Well, both of our animals are yelling at each other.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:58.610
Yeah.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.690
They're both doing their own versions of whining.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.210
You know, that's my soapbox on that.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.050
It's not, there's no blueprint for this.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:18.270
No, I don't know the, the, the thing that you just mentioned, uh, which I find

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.300
fascinating, right?

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:28.800
It's essentially now you can do the same thing, but instead of just allowing random

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.720
chance when everyone was working in the same building, you didn't have to do it

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.440
deliberately because random chance, right?

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.880
But there's no way for random chance to kick in.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.400
So you have to create environments where that can happen.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.840
Now, if you go back to where, um, we're good ideas come from the,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.400
the Steven Johnson book, he talks about the fact that when coffee house has

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.480
became prevalent in the whatever center that was, sorry, my history, innovation

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.880
accelerated cause people got together and talked, uh, we need to create

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.520
virtual coffee houses environment.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.240
People can just talk about things where ideas can, you know, ideas

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.120
come from other ideas.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.480
You need to create as a manager, you got to create environments where people can

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.840
bounce ideas of each other in a safe way.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.720
And then the good ideas can come out of that.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.120
If you're not doing that, just those ideas, we stay there.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.480
We're going to go back to the middle ages of tech.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:26.630
Uh, and I think there's still very much a risk of that, unfortunately.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:28.010
Right.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:34.560
The, the, um, where movements are going in tech right now.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.120
We'll see what happens, but, uh, we've, we have talked about this before drink.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.100
Um, I think it is entirely possible.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.780
Just like, like what caused us to start this podcast, right?

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.420
The, the, the collapse of the test discipline.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:54.700
Right.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.340
Um, and now the collapse of the dev discipline next up.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.460
Well, I don't even like it's tech.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.580
Like if, if dev goes, what do we need PM for?

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.980
Well, I want to tell you, I want to go back to our prediction

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.300
episode year before last.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.980
So 16 months ago, when I said the key skill for the future is the

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.100
is going to be the ability to read and evaluate code.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.300
And I think that is becoming more and more true as the engine start

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.460
generating more and more code for us, which is better and better.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.020
In fact, you remember, and we've had both had interviews where we had

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.580
to write code at a whiteboard.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.340
I think that's a stupid question now.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.610
That question is absolutely idiotic now because AI Gen AI can create that for me.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.650
I want, but Brent, but for you, would it be what's wrong with this

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:45.890
design or find the book?

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.970
I'm getting there.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:47.650
I'm getting there.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:55.500
What if I gave you a page of code virtually or remote and I asked you first question,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.700
what does this code do?

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.920
And you should be, no matter how bad it's written, anybody has

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.800
to be able to figure that out.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.600
So what problems, as long as it's not one of those lead code, no, you know what I

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:09.880
mean.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.760
Yeah, I know.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.800
I know what you mean.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.000
You generate the right thing.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.800
It's like, well, you don't ask somebody again.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.480
It's the stupid of all the chess moves on a chess table wants to figure out the

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.160
ones where the night could visit the most squares in 14 moves, you know, blow me.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.600
No, but give somebody some code that makes sense.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.920
Make sure that you should, again, it could be different, different levels.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.560
She built to explain what it does.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.240
And you ask, uh, what problems could exist?

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.460
And again, Gen AI code may have problems, input, validation, et cetera, et cetera.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.380
You can call those things out and you can say, how would you improve this code?

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.180
And one of the things, you know, in the accept accept accept world of AI generated

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:55.420
code, uh, I want people to take the code and then where it's confusing, it could be

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.300
a comment, it could be, I'm actually going to change the way this works.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.460
And I think it'll work better like this, but you can like, I think the program or

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.180
the future can take that Gen AI code, understand what it does, even though they

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.980
just asked what it did, tweak it as needed, make it more readable, both for

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:17.780
humans and Gen AI, and then, then check in that code to solve customer problems.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.220
But the ability to generate algorithms from scratch, who the hell cares about that anymore?

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:22.860
That's stupid.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.340
That was so 1997.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:34.470
Now, uh, I'm actually, um, this is something I have been thinking about.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.810
And that is all right.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:44.950
It's, it's interesting that we've moved to Gen AI and I, and I don't want

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.790
to go off topic because I've kind of.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.280
No, I don't know how we got here, but we are here and, but let's just,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.000
let's just, we'll go back.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:52.720
Yeah.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.900
The, um, small language models, right?

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.700
The, these are very context sensitive language models.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:10.760
And so I'm, I'm thinking through, okay, if I had a new API, okay.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.760
And the API that did all kinds of cool magic stuff, right?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:22.080
How could I build a code generator through that?

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:28.790
And I'm like, big, there's lots of interesting things you could do with that.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.550
Um, Oh my God.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.830
I love that we have animal sounds in our podcast.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.670
Yeah.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.790
I'm going to get this chickens.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.670
This one's annoying me and is about to get kicked up.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.950
One moment.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:41.630
Kicking.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:44.840
Show me.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.880
No, no, no.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.360
And the cat is gone.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:02.210
Testing the boundaries of Alan's no edit policy.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:03.130
I know.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.170
And what's going to happen with the cats, my cats use my daughter's cats.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:06.890
I don't, I hate cats.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:07.610
I don't want one on my own.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.370
You used to kind of beat on the door with their paws to come back in.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:11.410
So we'll see if that happens later.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.930
She'll start howling and I'm just going to ignore her.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:15.570
Okay.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.330
Yeah.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:17.210
Okay.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.080
Are we done with that?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.520
So I want to back up to, uh, the short answer is for your problem is as a

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.200
manager, as a leader, deliberate, you need to create, you need to work your

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.280
butt off to create as many opportunities for collaboration and for learning

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:38.080
about each other without adding more calendar, a more meeting time people's

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.600
calendars, because as you know, calendar time is the only thing that is totally

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.840
finite, uh, you can't create more of it and people are going to get more done.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.240
If they're, if their meetings are, are minimal to get their work done, but you

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.960
have to create some opportunities and you can do some things like, um, again,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.440
this puts meetings on the counters.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.280
You can do things like a donut chat where you randomly pair people on your

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.680
team, just to talk to each other about stuff.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.960
But I find three minutes at the beginning of a meeting, see how things are going.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.080
Uh, and then if you ever get everyone together, you can go a little bit deeper

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.200
and find out a little bit more about where they're from, where they live,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.640
et cetera, I just met with my directs in New York last week.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.690
And we spent some time at the beginning, like, what was your family like?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.570
Where'd you grow up?

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.010
Blah, blah, blah, just to get a little bit more information about each other,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.530
to begin to build trust right out of Pat Lincione, but you need to generate

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.690
those opportunities, people learn from each other and then give them

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.130
collaboration opportunities, make them work together, make them hang

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.010
out virtually with each other.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.010
There's of course, there's all kinds of games you can do online, but people

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.690
generally fade away from those because they just take more time.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.410
They could be working or, or watching Netflix.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:49.130
They could become competitive, right?

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:55.210
The right, what you want them to be doing is talking to each other.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:56.570
Yes.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:00.210
And then if you ever get them together, which you should, and actually

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.570
another way to accelerate that is same way as I took my team together

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.570
to New York last week is get us to hang out a little bit because that

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.690
accelerates everything out throughout the rest of the year.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.970
We spend a couple of days together, getting to know each other, much

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.050
easier to work together, understand how to help each other throughout

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:16.010
the entire rest of the year.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.170
So the other thing I would suggest is get your team together.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.120
I'm not sure what travel budgets are like in this, this world, but

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.000
it can just find, but again, if most of your team is in Redmond, just

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.560
flying four people out and unfortunately they have to come to Redmond,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.960
but you can just hang out for a couple of days, send them back.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.320
It's relatively cheap.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.720
Whatever that cost is, you know, $10,000, which is a lot of money.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.120
I'm making up a random round number, but you will get that back in

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.960
productivity throughout the rest of the year, guarantee it.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:52.990
Yeah, I'm not certain how I can sell that to the, you remember like safe limits?

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.950
I do.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:54.310
I do.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:59.150
But my argument is if you're going to have remote teams, you need to invest in travel.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:04.470
Current job, I might've blown my entire travel budget for the year by doing

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.750
this little mini offsite, but it's worth it.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.890
It's worth it.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.570
So get the team together.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:12.840
Okay.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.440
All right, man.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.800
I think that was like for me, the absolute, I mean, you

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.200
could have just, we could have just summed it up in five minutes.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.560
It's like, you have to be deliberate.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.520
I'm like, Oh, obviously.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.080
And I can't help.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.080
I can't give a short answer.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.200
So I get the long answer instead.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.000
Sure.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.680
Makes sense.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.360
Makes sense.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:29.760
All right.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.240
It's too much work to do a short answer.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.440
I got another thing to talk about.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.480
And nice.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.880
This is something we will talk about again, the next podcast and the one after

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.540
that, and if there's one after that.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:43.780
Okay.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.110
So, and, and Brent gives me the okay, something we've talked about a little

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.950
bit before offline.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.390
So, um, today's Friday.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:58.470
I gave you this, I gave notice at my job on Monday that I am leaving.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.250
And how did that go?

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.130
It went fine.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.290
Um, again, it, and I can be transparent here.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.130
Hasn't been the best fit for me.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:10.340
They haven't really needed what I, they haven't needed my superpowers very much.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.620
We've talked about this before.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.900
Uh, it's been interesting.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.580
I've learned a lot that people are great.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.660
I've actually really liked it, but it's been hard for me to do what

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.700
I'm best at, but that's not why I'm leaving.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.800
Not why I'm leaving.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.160
Why are you leaving now?

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.840
Don't make it silly.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:33.720
So, um, for ever since when I was a child, as you all know, I like to go on my long

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.800
hikes, I get therapy from the woods.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:45.190
Uh, I have an opportunity, meaning I have a permit to, uh, hike the Pacific

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.670
Crest Trail and walk from Mexico to Canada.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.870
So I am going to do that.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:52.580
Okay.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:59.180
I didn't realize, so listeners, I've been aware of this, um, for a while.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.030
Um, but I didn't realize a permit was necessary.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.990
Who did you get the permit from?

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.310
From the Pacific Coast Trail association.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:11.980
Okay.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.300
And that, that spans all countries.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:15.780
Dude.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.540
No, I'm in the, you know, California, Oregon and Washington.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:26.740
Those are all, you said Mexico from the Mexican border to the Canadian border.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.220
Okay.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.500
I will stick my arm into Mexico and then walk north.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.940
And then about four and a half months later, I will stick my arm into

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.500
Canada and then I will go home.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:42.640
Well, that's when, yeah, I'm going to walk home more or less.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.840
Um, the way it works is there's, there's no road at the border there at

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.600
the Canadian borders, you have to walk to the border.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.040
There's a little monument there.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.920
You kind of tag that, stick your arm into Canada.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.640
There's no fence.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.600
You can walk right in if you want, but, uh, and then you turn around and you

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.200
walk back 30 miles to, um, the closest road where you hope to hitchhike to a

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.680
small town where you can get a bus or another hitchhike to a larger town.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.400
So you can get back home.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.290
Oh, you know what?

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:11.130
That's, that's a, that's a problem for later, not a problem for now.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.290
So something I want to do for a long time.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.010
I've been mulling it over for a while.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.450
I think it makes sense for me to take this break now.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.250
So it means you're doing this by yourself.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.930
Yeah.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.690
I mean, there'll be a couple hundred other hikers doing the trail, several hundred,

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.450
but I'm not going with anyone.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:31.010
And there's a reason for that is, uh, there's a thing they say in long distance

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.170
hiking is hike your own hike.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.240
And some days I may want to go 10 miles, sit on a rock and

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.840
stare at the sunset for six hours.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.380
Some days I may, you know what, I feel good.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.420
I'm going to walk 30 miles.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.640
I don't, you know, I like, I have hiked other people and I do

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.680
like it for a short term, but I really want to go at my own rate.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.600
And not have to worry about someone else.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.800
I just, so yeah, I'm going to walk.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.480
Um, there'll be other people there I'll talk with, but, uh, yeah.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.680
So what was I going to say?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.000
Something I want to do for a long time.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.920
Um, this is a good time for me to do it.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.120
I do need a break from my job.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.960
And so I'm going to take a four and a half month mental health break where

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.080
I just kind of walk every day.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.200
I'll be professionally homeless.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.120
I'll be living out of a tent every night.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.920
Just that tent moves, uh, 15 to 20 or 25 miles down the trail every day.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.200
So what I was saying was that means two things.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.640
One is that, that what I just said, I'm homeless for five and a half

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.120
months while I'm paying mortgage here.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.790
Um, and then I'll be back in mid-September, which means

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.720
you'll be back in mid-September.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.720
I got to find a job in October.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.200
Okay.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.800
And I don't know what that is.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.040
I'm of course open to coming back to NBC.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.480
I may or may not.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.960
I think it's, it depends on a lot of things I have.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.640
I told a few close friends, right?

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.440
I wouldn't come work here.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.200
I wouldn't make any, like I would not make any plans at all.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.600
I'm not.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.640
I wouldn't even think about thinking about making plans.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.560
So I talked to him.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.840
I believe the world's going to change.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.480
Yes.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.560
By the time I finished Donald Trump may have cut down all the

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.240
forests I'm walking through, but someone told me, it's like, yeah, I

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.240
worried about leaving a job in this economy.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.600
I was talking to a friend of mine about this.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:36.960
I said, dude, if you can walk 2,600 miles, you can find a job in this

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.140
economy and they're right.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.120
And again, I don't need to look, I like being a VP.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.040
I like being, you know, leading strategy for an organization.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.440
I like executive coaching, which things I've done in this role in the past.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.080
There's a lot of things I like about these, you know, senior

00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:02.020
management, uh, software roles, but in America where healthcare is a

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.530
privilege and not a right, you know, I may do something totally

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.430
different, uh, if it has good health insurance, but we'll see.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.270
And I'll figure that out in October.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:19.160
I, I, it makes zero sense for me to think about it before them.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.360
Now I could do all this.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.040
I could break my leg on the third day and then, uh, everything continues

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.760
on and on and on.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.880
Uh, I don't think that's going to happen.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:32.880
Uh, but no, if you break, if I break my leg, I'm going to take some

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.160
fricking duct tape, wrap it around, real tight and keep going.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.020
That'll make a good story.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.420
I mean, what else are you going to do?

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.210
Like you have like the locator safety stuff.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:45.810
Yeah.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.090
Yeah.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:50.370
So if you break your leg, they'll, they'll be able to find what,

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.090
what bears swallowed you.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.570
This, this don't, the black bears don't need anything.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.370
I have a little device that tracks where I am.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.970
It's in satellite messages is great.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.330
And you have like solar chargers.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.080
No, I bring dude.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.560
I just have a normal lightweight, like battery pack charger.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.240
And then, um, you pass through towns every like three to seven days and

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.800
you recharge that and you're good to go.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.200
I have something.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.000
Let me, I hope it's relevant to our conversation.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.160
So this is brand new.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.360
So I haven't let my team, by the time this podcast comes out, folks at work will

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.560
know enough people know that it's not that big of a deal and nothing's going to

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.400
change, but, uh, I thought I'd just throw it out there for the listeners.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.480
Cause we're, what that means for the podcast.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.640
A third thing it means is that we're going to take a break from the

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.440
podcast for a while while I'm doing my thing and we will not do the podcast.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.720
While I'm gone, I have the podcast recording equipment and the ability to

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.160
upload.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.480
So Brent's not going to do it without me.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.800
Uh, one of these, not the next one, maybe the one after that and possibly

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.040
the one after that will be the last AB testing podcast for a while.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.420
All right.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.820
What are you showing me, Brent, for our podcast audience?

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:01.980
Okay.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.280
First off, actually, let me hold on.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.120
Oh God.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.880
Here he goes again.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.000
He's going to go get the cat.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.150
And this is great podcast material where Brent grabs stuff to show.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.830
I'm sure.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.230
Yeah.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.630
Yay.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.110
Podcast material.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.030
I'll describe until now.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.870
Uh, so I've had this for years.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.670
Okay.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.160
Goal zero by Sherpa.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:28.530
Okay.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:35.030
It's a, it's a battery pack comes with attachments like this one.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.790
Okay.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.870
A light.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:38.210
Okay.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.090
But the cool thing about it is this.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.000
Oh, solar.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.200
That's solar dude.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.840
That stuff is so heavy.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.390
I'm not, I mean, you were going to say something like that, but you, you

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.750
pinned this onto the back of your, your, I assume you're going to have a

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:57.670
how much is that way?

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.720
Uh, it weighs at least a pound.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.240
At least too much.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.840
Do you know how, guess how much do my pack plus my tent sleeping bag, first aid

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.120
kit, um, everything, guess how much my pack weighs without food or water on it?

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.600
Like fully loaded.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.970
Uh, you have a sleeping bag.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:20.490
Yeah.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.050
Do you have a sleeping pad?

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:29.010
I have a sleeping bag, a pad, a tent, uh, a puffy jacket, uh, uh, um, fleece

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:35.850
hoodie, uh, some long underwear to sleep in first aid, electronics, including,

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:40.210
you know, a couple of these, these battery chargers, um, phone.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.050
I'm going to go with seven.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:44.920
Okay.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.960
No more than that, but 11.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.100
Okay.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.620
It's not very heavy.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.980
A pound is huge at that level.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.840
I don't want to carry an extra pound for charging.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.080
So not going to happen, but I'm keeping it pretty light.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.240
Um, but that's not much.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.320
If you pick up like a 10 pound weight, you know, that's pretty much.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.600
Well, we'll talk.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.040
Well, and then it's the weight of the pack as well.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.040
You're bringing like baby powder or petroleum jelly.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:12.680
For what?

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.920
Uh, the chafing you're going to have.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.560
Let it bleed.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.280
Let it bleed.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.040
It'll, it'll scab up.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.440
You'll be fine.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.160
Callous baby.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:21.920
Callous.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.160
Yeah.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.520
The last, last week Alan went twice as slow because he had to walk bowlegged.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.640
I've done enough hundred mile hikes that I feel pretty confident about.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.640
That it's just doing 26 of those back to back.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.440
Oh yeah.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.080
And well, if you put it that way, it's yeah, it's nothing.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:39.640
Yes.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:39.920
Sure.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.360
Nothing.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.000
Absolutely nothing.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:47.240
So, um, yeah, so, uh, for our next few podcasts, if you're on our Slack

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.720
group, um, at what you can go to modern testing.org and join that Slack group.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.960
Uh, happy to take questions about the hike.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.360
Happy to take questions about the break.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.600
Happy to take questions about, uh, what's next in October.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.720
I won't know those answers and I will probably.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.430
A couple folks have asked how I'm going to document this.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:10.590
So, uh, I already made a Google sheet because I can have an offline one and

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.390
Excel is kind of a big fat pig.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:17.710
Uh, I'm going to keep pretty good data on my mileage elevation, a lot of things.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.990
So they can, so I can geek out on the data when I get back.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.820
Um, I'm thinking, but that's not what the people want, Alan.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:26.700
What do they want?

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.140
They want to be able to, to, to track your progress.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:31.420
Yeah.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:36.340
So I think I may do like, like some people do like 15 to 20 minute videos

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.420
for every day of the hike.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.820
And those people are far more ambitious than I am.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.580
I'm thinking like one YouTube short for every day of the hike.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.260
Uh, sure.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.080
Or I don't know.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:54.280
I would be interested in you doing like a location share in

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.360
some sort of public thing.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:55.720
You know what?

00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:00.040
I can do that because I have four of my little, uh, satellite tracking

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.080
device I showed you, you can see where I am at any point and I can share that link

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.760
out to, and I'll share that in our slack groups.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.000
If our slack group, you can go there.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.760
You will know where I am at any point.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.680
You can watch me trickle north.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:12.900
That would be fun.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:13.780
Yeah.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:15.720
We can do that.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.880
Cause I don't think I'm the kind of person who would try and stalk or anything.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.920
Like, um, so like if you knew exactly where I was, you can come find me,

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.040
which is weird, but I don't think our listeners are those people.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.040
So I'm good.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.680
Please don't come stalk me and track me now without warning me.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.280
Cause that'd be weird.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.760
But yeah, you can watch me trickle.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.050
Yeah.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.530
I don't know how they warn you.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.020
So I guess that means like, please don't come stock out.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:42.860
Yeah.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.300
I'm going to go code of honor here.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.340
Please don't come stalk me.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:46.540
Yeah.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.180
There you go.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.460
Okay.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:48.980
All right.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:53.180
So I think that's probably a good place to hang it up for the day because I

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.540
don't have any other topics to talk about.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.820
No, me neither.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:56.820
Okay.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.820
Once again, this is episode four 17 of the E B testing podcast.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.780
It is two 17.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.420
Oh, did I say four 17?

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.180
You did.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.620
Well today's, let's say it's pie day.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.950
It is Friday.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:11.350
Yeah.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.790
Nice.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:12.150
All right.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.030
Well, I'm Alan.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:14.030
I'm Brent.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:14.550
We'll see you later.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.470
Bye.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.540
I want.
