WEBVTT

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.590
Happy holidays everyone. Happy holidays. I'm Alan. I'm Brit. And we're here for episode 32 of AB Testing.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:28.270
32. The last AB Testing of 2016. 15. The last AB Testing of 2015. Because it's not 2016 yet.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.830
And I was thinking the other day when the year changed, I remember there was a time when it

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.350
took a month for you to start writing the correct date on your checks. Yep. But we don't have that

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.310
problem anymore because no one writes checks anymore. That's true. We sent email and email

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.670
already figured it out. It already has a day for us. So computers are, I don't know if they're making

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
us smarter or allowing us to continue to be done. They're improving our lives. That's a pain point

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.310
for everybody every year. And it's now a pain point. They're improving our lives. No, it's all right.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.430
Computers have made the fact that we no longer actually have to, we can remember what year it

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.540
is at our own leisure. Yeah. Computers already know it. And now that I'm over 50, I don't really

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:25.100
even care anymore. Have you noticed as you get older, it seems like time goes faster? No.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.780
It's always the same. The same slow march towards death. Fair enough. Okay. Hey, before we start

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.020
today, we have a very special, Brent and I are going to sing Christmas carols. No, don't,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.560
don't press stop kidding. Kidding. Say, I wanted to give a shout out to a couple of guys from

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.680
hotels.com who sent me a LinkedIn request to have a drink and they invited Brent to, and I

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.640
mostly forgot to invite Brent and I forgot about them because I don't check my LinkedIn

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.800
very often until the last minute. And I was a really busy week and I said, Oh, hey,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.440
I'll meet you for a drink. So I met with cash and Sam and David. The hotels.com, you know,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.320
is owned by Expedia. Right. So David, I hope that name is right. It does work in the Bellevue

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.360
office. A very similar path to mind getting into software. Very interesting. It's cool.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.400
And cash is their director of QA, I believe. And Sam was just some marketing guy, but nice

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.920
regardless of that. I had a good time. I hung out for about an hour, talked about the biz,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.840
talked about people in the biz, talked about the podcast, little, et cetera, et cetera. But

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.280
always happy to visit with one member, any members of the three. Right. And it could,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.320
do you think it's seven? No, it's three. It's three. Okay. No, I like how you phrase it the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.070
other day. It's always just three. Just the people just rotate in and out. It's like

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.870
turtles all the way down. All right. So hotels.com. I find it, I find these type of things

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.150
fascinating. So this is the second time a representative, a company has reached out,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.230
Redfin being the first in my mind to the podcast. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.840
Maybe that's a topic for the agenda. I don't know. Yeah. What do you think,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.760
do you have any intuition as to what inspired them to reach out? I think they're going to be in

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.440
Bellevue and, and, uh, one of his keys, David beer in some regards, because I think about what

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.120
we represent to the test community. Cause in some regards to some portion of the test community,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.200
well, to some portion, we're like sacrilege and well, absolutely. That's what I was thinking.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.340
But I think that's changing. It's interesting. Uh, that's going to come up a lot today because

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.740
today we have a very special show. It's kind of like a very special Christmas, but without the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.740
singing, we're going to talk about some of our reflections from 2015, some, some, including some

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.740
of our favorites, not just for 2015, but just a given a few shout outs. And then, uh, we're going

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.760
to talk about what's going to happen in 2016, including some wild predictions, predicting the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.060
future is hard, especially when it's about the future or something like that. Yogi Berra quote.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.450
Yeah. Predicting. No, no, I thought Yogi Berra was one of my pick and nick basket.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.140
Oh, yeah. You'll get there.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.180
Hard, especially when they're about the, yeah, I know I had already got gone down a path. I

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.300
didn't want to correct it. So, uh, we'll go with that. So for a baseball player, he was a wise,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.700
wise man. Okay. So Brent, yes, Alan, give me in the kind of, what's the highlights? What happened

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:48.500
to you in 2015? Give me your recap. Uh, 2015. Thank you. I would say the single most important

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:58.860
thing that has happened to me in 2015 was my new job. The Ditto. Yeah. The, the, I had,

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.700
now in a formal data science role, uh, on a team that has a lot of problems in this space. I don't

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.350
know about you, but I, they say men are all problem solvers, but I'm extra problem solvery.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.150
I love teams with problems. The biggest, the hardest, the ones where people say we can't

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.350
change this. I love those. I was going to ask if that meant you were a man's man,

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:35.550
but I know that's not correct. You can just look at me right now. That's not true. It's hard to

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:43.790
look at you, Brent. So right now, um, so at work today, we have an ugly sweater contest

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.070
and unfortunately for the podcast, it works better if we, if we look at each other to,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:56.350
to be able to bounce off of each other's body language. And unfortunately, uh, I get to look at

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.990
a cool sweatshirt, a t-shirt from Allen and he gets to look at me and, um, probably the single

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.110
ugliest 49ers Christmas holidays sweat or sweater ever. Yeah. And I love this boring, boring,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:19.710
boring, boring. All right. So that's for me in summation, uh, the absolute best things I get to

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.590
do data science stuff. Um, you went to strategy. You see, you went on the road for this. I, but I,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:37.950
this was a year where I finally went to New York, which was fantastic. Um, summer travels. Uh, all I

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.670
did was I've gone to Walt Disney world. I've done that before. Um, but it was the first time with my

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:49.070
five year old daughter. So that's always fun. Very cool. For me, I was thinking while you were

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.990
talking because I don't, wasn't really listening, but I understand you said, uh, the job change and

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.350
the new job. And for me, absolutely. This, uh, much better role for it aligns with what we talk

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:06.350
about in the podcast. It aligns with what kind of sort of who I am and what I do and the value

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.990
I bring to the team. Uh, I'm a hole filler. I'm a problem solver. I'm a Wheeler and a dealer. Uh,

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.550
but what, what actually what I was thinking about was you said, it's your job. And I said ditto.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:25.230
And which means same thing, which is something that only my job is your best thing in 2015.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:31.230
But Brent, we'll talk about just to bring my age thing in here again, as I'm, as I continue to be

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:38.430
ponder my, uh, my, my decades on the planet. How long has it been since they've used a ditto machine?

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.020
Maybe elementary school. I just flashed back to sixth grade.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.780
So I'm in it. Yeah. Um, I fire that word out once in a while, but I think I'm going to find

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.260
the new younger hip word so I can relate to the young, to the, um, more youthful listeners.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.540
I think they still use ditto. Did they really that word? Does that word mean anything to anybody?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.060
Well, let's save that for the comment section. So for me, I think the closest is, uh, I K R.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.730
I know. Right. Right. Yeah. But you don't say, but you don't say I K R out loud.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:22.430
Like I would look at you and go, LOL. Because that's kind of stupid. So, um, other than that,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.630
um, great time. I did some traveling this year. I didn't write them all down. So probably going

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.190
to forget something. No huge vacations this year. The previous year was my year of massive

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:37.710
numbers of vacations, um, or massive time away from work. But this year I did a quick

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.750
trip to Vegas for the better software conference to, uh, fill in for a speaker that I canceled,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.470
which was great. Cause that has turned into a, uh, a workshop for this year, which I'm excited

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:55.760
about in June. And I did, um, in the Netherlands, uh, the Eurostar deep dive at a great,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.420
met so many cool people there. Um, it was a good time. I'm really glad I went,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.060
leading up to it. I have to say, and hopefully the star folks aren't listening, but it's like,

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.020
this happens to me sometimes when I do conferences, I go, you know, I thought this would be a good time

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.900
to go. Good time for me to be away. But man, this is a hard, hard week to be gone. And it

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.260
happened again, but I'm still, I'm glad I, and then I'm glad I went. So it worked out really well

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:26.820
despite my, um, like 36 hours trip home, but great times. Um, let's talk about a few of our

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.820
favorites. Um, I want to just kind of give a, and these aren't like, I didn't like stack rank.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:37.540
These I hate these top 10 lists of blogs, Twitter followers, blah, blah, blah. But just,

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:43.620
I just wanted to mention, uh, better than, uh, I mean us retrospecting this way is in my view better

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:51.620
than us forming together the best of AB testing podcast. Yeah. Cause it would be like three

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:59.970
seconds long. Hey, everybody click. So do you want to start? Um, do you want to tell me,

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:06.210
do you have a favorite podcast or blog or, or anything you want to share? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:17.780
So my absolutely, uh, favorite podcast, um, is the series, uh, Freakonomics. They have a, oh,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.260
yeah. I haven't listened to that in a while. I do like freaking out.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:26.260
I listened to that every time, but I went and looked and tried to find, um, one in particular

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.640
that, uh, just one episode that I was like, Oh wow. And they're just all awesome. So, um,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:42.980
my selection is, uh, from a different podcast, this American life, uh, often you'll hear,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.980
Oh yeah. I like this American life on NPR and it's episode four, oh three, where they talk about

00:10:49.060 --> 00:11:00.780
the new me plant in Fresno, California. And the story is about how GM just tried to do an experiment,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:08.830
alongside Toyota. Um, and they shifted one of their American plants and it was the least,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:16.860
uh, functional plant that GM was managing and they were almost about to close it. Um,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:25.060
but they basically built American trucks or American cars. I forget what actual car they built

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:32.740
using the Toyota process. And it was the first, uh, plant that was essentially using Agile

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:41.280
methodologies for manufacturing. And in a matter of year, um, it may have been two years. This

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:51.460
plant ended up being the single most functional plant and profitable plant in GM's, uh, fleet. Um,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:12:00.130
but if you go, look, this plant no longer exists. They, it got sold and it's gone. And the primary

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:08.830
reason was GM leadership. They all refused to believe it was because of the process. And I,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:17.470
boy, there are lessons to be learned. Yeah. When, when, um, put an Astro Scott, I put a pin in that

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.470
they keep on going, but that's going to come up later in predictions. I want to reference that.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:31.260
When, when I, when I, uh, so I have helped, uh, numerous teams shift to Agile and it has

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:44.300
continuously, um, befuddled and irritated me on how easy it is for management to, to ignore how

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:57.420
awesome what they are able to do now, um, view it as a one-off and, um, abandon it primarily because

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:07.970
fear of, uh, change, uh, the flood fear, uncertainty, doubt. Yep. The one biggest thing that happened here,

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:18.110
um, uh, was, Hey, this changed the power structure. This changed, uh, how re reviews would be done.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:28.740
This changed essentially, uh, everything that the leadership was used to. And that was more

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:34.500
important to the leadership than running a better business. Yeah. That happens a lot. We always hear

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:41.300
stories about that. Yeah. In fact, sometimes I get mad at how often management air quotes management

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:47.230
gets blamed for problems, but there's an example where you can actually validly point it there.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:53.710
It's a great episode. This American life episode four, oh three titled new me. Okay.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.030
I interpreted this prediction. This, this fave little difference. I'm not gonna talk about a

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.630
specific podcast specific podcast. I'm going to talk about my favorite podcast. And I couldn't

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.110
pick once I picked three, there's three I listened to faithfully every week. And one comes out

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.270
multiple times a week. And it's my, it's my morning commute show. So it's actually my favorite. So

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:18.430
I'll go in reverse order, my top three. Uh, so again, just sharing, sharing random stuff.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.030
These have nothing to do with software testing. Like yours is actually, you can relate it to

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.870
your job. These are just things that actually helped me get through the day by make,

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.350
by engaging my brain in different ways. And actually for my number one, I do have a favorite

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.390
episode, which actually is the most recent, which is it appeals to every bit of geek in my body.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.630
And I'm as I'm wearing my geek t-shirt to my smart bear t-shirt says geek on it.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:50.690
But, um, also, so with that preamble, uh, also from NPR, I used to listen to wait,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:56.370
wait, don't tell me on the radio all the time. I would, I would make sure I'd have my alarm

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:01.250
set. So I love the show. I think it's clever. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. You don't have to look

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:09.810
it up. No, I'm just typing it. So, uh, wait, wait. Don't tell me is NPR. It's, um, it's a

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:19.200
quiz show kind of thing, but the it's, it's done. It's very funny. It's very witty. Uh,

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.960
the characters are great. They had Nico case on last week who I love. And, uh, it was just,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.960
it's a fun show to listen to. I like it cause I, and they have, they, they're guests every week.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:36.450
Sometimes you learn the most insightful things from them. Um, uh, I'm not going to go listen

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.810
to examples cause I didn't get into a rat hole. I'd never get out of wait, wait, don't tell me

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.130
fun show. Listen to it every week. I skipped the best of weeks when they're doing filler, but,

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:49.730
uh, it's always fun. I always, always enjoy that show. And I always, it's actually, it's sort of a,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.450
um, way for me to catch up on current events also. Cause the quizzes are based on current

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.570
events. Like what happened in the news is like who said this? Then they make some

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:03.570
jokes about it. It's pretty funny. It's really where I've gained the vast majority of my Trump

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:18.370
humor. Next one is I, I am F you. So I am a bit, I do like kind of trivia ran, you know, um,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.690
when I was younger and had more free time, I'm the kind of guy that would go to trivia nights

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.090
and pubs and I drink more than I helped the trivia team. So it was fun. I like, I don't like

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.290
showing off my knowledge. I like learning the knowledge. So I don't care if I had a winner,

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.170
get things around there and go, Oh wow, that's really cool. I learned something.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:41.820
So there's a show called, um, good job brain, uh, which I listened to and it's, uh, uh, for

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:48.540
Bay area folks, two men, two women, and they just do random trivia, fart jokes, um, uh,

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.180
quizzes, et cetera, et cetera. But it's fun. So it's like trivia pursuit on the air. Yeah.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.500
But they're actually, they're, they're really popular. They actually did a podcast recording

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.490
in a theater and people show up like they got, they got, they got serious game going on.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.650
There's fun. But my favorite one, like peeling to the other side of my geek,

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:13.250
maybe we should think about that. No, no. Imagine what the podcast would be like if,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.930
if we were entertaining or informative, dude, we tried that at redfin. Oh, right.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:30.660
So my favorite, um, uh, my favorite podcast to listen to is, uh, uh, a podcast called total

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:37.580
soccer show, which is, I listened to the MLS podcast for a while. It's called extra time radio

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.300
and it just awful. The, the speak, the speakers are awful. They just, they're just, they're,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.860
it's hard to listen to. They only speak about MLS teams and I kind of like worldwide soccer.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:53.180
So I found this podcast a year or so ago called total soccer show. It's not the sounders, right?

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.940
Dude, why do you have to like, what is your favorite team? Favorite team is probably the

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:05.420
sounders. I like the local TV. Gotta support the local team. No, I don't. Yeah. It says,

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:13.660
I say to the guy wearing a 49ers jersey. Yeah. Great. Um, no, I actually thought you were,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:20.700
oh, maybe it's, maybe it's our buddy James. Uh, I thought that, uh, I thought your favorite team

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:27.100
was some team in England. Well, my favorite team before the sounders had, uh, MLS league,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.940
even that a, uh, a lower level team, my favorite team before the sounders became a pro team was

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:39.310
arsenal. Where, where are they? They're in the premier league in England. Okay. English

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.910
Premier League. Gotcha. I think it's just called the premier league. No, they keep on changing

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.230
the name. It's Barclays Premier League. I don't know. Anyway, total soccer show. Very cool.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:53.790
But their last episode, okay. I got to lead up to this because like last week they had an episode

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.990
of they, and they, they cover games really well in depth. And one thing I like to do is to do these

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:04.270
very specific predictions. So they do these predictions for games and it's not things like,

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:11.390
you know, um, man city will beat Norwich. No, it's the goalie will do a tornado kick and score.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:17.070
Dude, dude, dude, just don't call him a goalie. Call him the keeper. Sorry. All right. I had learned

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:22.990
that. So, uh, they'll say, um, so and so we'll do three stepovers, go around the defender and

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:29.060
score a goal sometime during the game or so and so we'll get a yellow card or the team will have

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.820
three very specific predictions that, you know, just kind of, and they'll say statewide. So it's

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:38.580
very interesting. They're analysis. I love analysis, whether it's of software or of soccer,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:45.890
but last week or maybe two weeks ago, they did an episode on, uh, the star were starting 11. So

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:53.170
there's two hosts and let me finish 11. Each one picked what they, a soccer team from keeper

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.730
standard four, four, two, four backs, you know, flat, flat floor in the back, uh, uh, four in the

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:02.450
mid two strikers. They picked who from the star Wars universe would play each position and why,

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:10.050
which was pretty cool, but even cooler this last week, they did the Marvel cinematic world

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:19.540
starting 11. So you had to pick from the Marvel cinematic world. Are there 11 dude, dude from

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:25.230
just marvel? Yes, there are. Yeah, they had different teams and the teams were awesome

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:30.190
because, oh yeah. If you add in the X-Men, you could get it. No, no. X-Men actually are not part

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.270
of the Marvel cinematic universe or a separate thing, but we do have Avengers and guardians of

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:39.710
the galaxy to choose from plus. What do you mean? X-Men are not part of the Marvel cinematic

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:47.470
universe. Dude, dude, I cannot know dude, dude, dude, I'm good. I'm not going to go read to you

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:52.030
from marvel that X-Men are a separate franchise, but they're not part of the universe. So

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.350
Marvel cinematic universe, and I can't believe I'm geeking out here is where this universe

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.150
that marvels crazy. Like this is like, like we're Jessica Jones and Daredevil and the Avengers

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.470
and all these folks live is actually, they, they can intertwine and connect the X-Men. There will

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:11.870
be no crossover there. They're separate. So anyway, dude drives me crazy. You're looking

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.750
shit up while I'm talking, but you got to imagine who is your best center defender,

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.550
who is the best defender. Of course, it's captain America. He's got a shield. Who do you want to

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:29.550
put in there to, to, to clean up and make sure nobody gets anywhere. The Hulk. And I great,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:37.950
the left back. I can't remember who's it was, but I'm Groot. Sure. I'm Groot. Groot would be

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:42.990
a pretty kick ass defender as well. Yeah. Anyway, appeal to all, all of my geekiness,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.790
soccer and Marvel comics all at once was, was really cool. Is there a position for ant man?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:53.470
Yes. Anywhere. Actually, there's, there's two ways to think ant man. Um, the best position

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.290
for ant man is a striker. And let me explain why. And then you can stop looking at your damn

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:04.270
computer while I talk. All right. Ant man. So if you know, soccer, what you, the good striker

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:10.110
wants to do is stay just on side the whole time. And the metaphor they say is you want

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.590
to stay on the shoulder of the last defender. So when that pass comes through, you can bolt

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:20.860
forward and get to that ball and just only have to go against the keeper. So ant man can literally

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:27.260
be on the shoulder of the defender literally. And then somebody has kicks it through ball.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:34.260
He bursts into full size, gets the ball, scores a goal. Ant man is a fantastic striker. All right.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.420
That was pretty fantastic. Yeah. That was from the show. I did not make that up. That is stuff

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.500
I learned listening to a soccer show. So how about, how about rocket? Can you do the same thing with

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.860
rocket? I am going to take your computer and I'm going to bust it over your head.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.980
I'm just amazed at the X-Men aren't considered part of the MCU.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:23:01.150
Dude, there's so much of the wrong kind of geek in you. Let me, I'll continue.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.430
I'm a breathwise geek. So I'm only going to mention one blog I like this year. I read,

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:16.180
I have a, I need to clean out my, my feedly feeds. I have too many and some I'd never look at.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:21.060
Some I always click on markers read. I've never read. I need, I need a feature that says if I've

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.940
never actually scrolled down and doing this blog, just remove it for me or put it into my,

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.260
you know, back burner. So I need to do that sometime manually, but I read a lot of blogs

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:37.220
and consistently over at least the past year or longer, I've been reading this blog called

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.860
a season testers crystal ball by this finished tester. Her name is

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:50.260
Marat Fieri Arvi. That sound finished. I'm going to, I'm going to do it. But I like her posts

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.100
because I sometimes I look at my go, I could have wrote that, but she wrote it better.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:24:00.510
That's that relates to an experience I have. And I also like in testing, there are,

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:07.950
I'm not going to go into rant mode, but there are a lot of blind followers of like of,

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.940
I see a lot of blog posts that are, Oh, you've rehashed something. One of the people you,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.820
you respect has said before, you just rehashing it, rehashing it, rehashing. That's great.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:25.780
And then sometimes I see not only thought, but I see someone confident enough in what they're

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:31.540
doing to stand up. And even if they know that people are reading them are not going to agree

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:36.180
with them, this is my experience. This is why I think it's good and blah. And I see that from

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:44.420
consistently. So it's, it's a, one of the few blog posts or posts that I always read when a blog

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.060
post comes out. I wanted to give her a shout out. And if you, if you're not reading a season

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:55.700
testers, crystal ball or following my Rhett M A A R E T P on Twitter, you probably should,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.940
because I think she has a lot of great things to say. You know what we should,

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:07.490
I'll send you the links to the things that I've, I've put down because that makes sense to put

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:12.290
in the blurb for this one. Yeah. I'll actually have to write a regular like longer post for

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.250
this one. So yeah, send me your stuff. So Brett, do you have a favorite? You probably did a favorite

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:22.530
specific blog post, but maybe not. I don't know. What do you have for the blogosphere you want to

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:33.780
share with our listeners? These are our gifts to you. So my absolute favorite post I couldn't

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:43.950
find because you're the one who found it. And it was, it was the, so we could start with my favorite

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:52.670
podcast, AB podcast. I'll give, no, we're not. No, my favorite AB podcast was the generalizing

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:59.230
specialist episode. Oh, what number was that? I don't know. Damn it. Long ago. It was the,

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:09.040
Allen and Brent finally had the, the, the generalizing specialist, specializing generalist battle.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:17.440
And then you came in with a post that, that very aptly described generalizing specialists.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:26.770
So I, for me, that was probably the most important blog post of the year.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:35.020
Was that this year? It was, we did it like in January, March, February, April, May, one of those

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:46.670
months. The, the non-testing blog that I follow most is something called leadership freak.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:55.980
And essentially what he does is that freak FR or PHR. FR. Okay. It's on WordPress. He,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:03.900
what's his tagline? The, the best leadership inspiration he can do in 300 words or less. So

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:14.540
it's, it's like a double Twitter, a double tweet. And he continuously posts and it's these fantastic

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:20.780
insights on what it, the difference between leadership and management. Just, just love it.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:33.250
And then on the test front, this one was harder. One of the things that's, that's begun to happen

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:42.130
is a lot of the, in my view, the useful test blogs are really beginning to die off.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:49.410
There's a lot of test blogs and podcasts that you go now and you go, Hey guys,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:57.490
last episode, 2014, last episode, 2013, last blog post, but Michael Larson's

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:04.720
still alive and well. Yeah. And he's prolific. He's, he's fantastic. I also usually, I'll,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.360
I'll, I'll always read his bike, 95% of the time read his and beginning to end when they come out.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:26.290
The thing I like about his posts is he's learning and publishing around how the test discipline is

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:33.220
morphing. Right. You go look at his several last several posts and they're going to be about

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:48.540
agile testing, which I think is the next phase that we'll see those, those teams that do have

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:57.420
testers. I think that will be the, the dominant way to do testing very soon. Yeah. Michael is another

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:03.950
one who's when I read his posts, there's, we have a lot of similarities in how we,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:10.590
uh, kind of how we contribute to our teams. How about you? We already do you. We already did me.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.430
Okay. Fantastic dude. Any other memories from 2015? You want to share it before we go on?

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:22.660
No, I got to meet, um, Steven Johnson this year, who was, uh, I'm a total Steven Johnson fanboy.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:28.020
Yeah. He's the guy that wrote, um, how we get to now, which I rip off of a lot to one of the best

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:34.210
books I read on innovation. He's, he's also where ideas come from, right? No. We're good ideas come

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:41.090
from. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. My son and I watched his, he did a series on PBS and he was really,

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:44.210
I wanted to watch and I said, you might like this. It's like, yeah, who watched the next

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.370
story? Who watched the next one? So it was really cool. Um, I think he's just a smart,

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:53.890
actually a smart guy, great writer. You really enjoy him. Sometime this, uh, this year you,

00:29:53.890 --> 00:30:01.760
you talked about, uh, that, that PBS show. Um, I've tried to record it. I just couldn't find it.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:10.290
I think it's on Netflix. Oh, yeah. Fantastic. So send out the name. Oh, I will look at that too.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:14.050
We'll try to remember all this stuff. Um, I'll take notes while I ask you this question.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:19.650
So, um, any big road trips real quick, uh, any, any trips for software planned in 2016,

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.370
you're going to strata again, you go into do anything else.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:29.570
There's no plans just yet. Um, we'll see. All right. I'll be a better software next year,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.930
my 20th anniversary. So I'm trying to think of something, um,

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:40.320
20th work anniversary wedding anniversary. Ah, so, um, the important one, the work one

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.200
doesn't matter. Yeah. The work one happened already. Yeah. I thought it, I thought maybe

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.500
there was that we, we had that story before. So I have a few months to figure out what I'm

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.950
going to do there. Um, but other than that, I would love to be able to go back to strata

00:30:55.950 --> 00:31:02.400
again. We'll see if I can pull that off. Very cool. Um, this year for me, I'm going to do better

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:09.520
software, uh, in, uh, Las Vegas in June, going down for a workshop, probably just stay a couple

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.800
nights, but if any of the three are there, I'm sure I'll bring it up as we get closer.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.960
Uh, I'm actually beginning to get really excited about that presentation. I think I can do a

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:26.180
good, a good workshop. Um, when is it in June? Oh, do you already know you had to submit a,

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.740
proposal, right? Yeah, I was told, yeah, the topic was given to me. It's another thing. It's

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:36.180
experimentation. Okay. Um, one thing I'd like to do, I don't know if you know about this and I,

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:46.260
it never works out. And, uh, as far as, um, I mentioned before that when I go to comp,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.740
it's hard for me to commit that time away. Um, both from family and from work. There's always

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:58.340
so much stuff going on, but one of these years, I'm very curious to go to, uh, Esther Derby teaches,

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.860
um, Weinberg's, um, problem solving leadership course, uh, about twice a year. I still really

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:08.260
want to go to that before it's like, doesn't happen again forever. Um, here are great things

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:17.600
about that. So that may happen in 2016. We'll see how I do. Other than that, I have no plans.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.040
That reminds me it like every so often Edward Tuff comes, comes by. I think it's Tufftee, right?

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.420
Sure. We'll go with Tufftee. He comes by and does a presentation. It's very rare, but I haven't really

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:36.220
I think he comes by like once a year. Yeah, it's very, I've never gone. I, I've thought about going

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:42.030
a couple of times, but yeah, I'll put it on the back pocket. Okay. Let's do some predictions

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:48.670
before we get out of here today. Okay. So, um, what you kind of hinted at it already, you kind of,

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:55.150
maybe you have a different one in your, in your list to there. Uh, but what's a big trend that you

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.870
or something, I dunno, some, some trend in software use. You'll see

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:08.750
software engineering in 2016. I didn't, I didn't talk about it. Um, so, uh,

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.940
I was that one I spent a long time thinking about because when I, when I look at this,

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:25.570
I generally think through where do I see momentum? And it's usually across now four different themes.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:36.290
Do I see a momentum difference in dev, PM, test, or, or now data science. Okay. And for 2016,

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:45.220
um, for most of those, I do think, uh, I don't think we'll hit a tipping point in any of those

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:53.200
things. I do think we'll see much of the same, um, uh, slow moving crap that we do today. I do think

00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:02.380
dev not testing their code. Uh, uh, I do think the arguments around, well, you don't even want dev

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.620
testing their own code will still persist. I don't think we'll have hit the tipping point

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:13.500
but that creates the momentum to shut down those arguments. Um, but on the data science,

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:22.540
I do think in 2016, so my prediction is on, I call it the rise of the crappy data analyst.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:35.900
Um, I do think what we will see is a large glut of people who have used

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:48.580
a couple of techniques, um, plus have a skill around, uh, professing the emperor's beautiful

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:56.670
new clothes and convince, uh, lots of people to do really, really, really bad things without

00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:03.820
sufficient due diligence. So I can take that sound bite without the very beginning where you say

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:09.420
they'll use a few techniques, they'll, uh, make some choices and convince people to do bad things.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:19.020
And you could apply that to people. Fair enough. Fair enough. Right. But, but data scientists has

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:25.580
data science has been the big buzzword for a couple of years. A couple of years. Um, I do

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:32.220
think training, like I don't know if you're aware, um, there is now an internal certification

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:38.300
process for Microsoft. You can go into, I don't, I haven't done any research on this,

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.220
but I got to imagine it's going to be something ridiculous, like a 12 week course

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:49.860
and get a cert certificate signed by Satya. Oh my God. So I don't care.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:58.660
You have to see the parallel in this trend and software testing at Microsoft.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.140
Tell a story. And I do in that, in that, in that big, uh, doorstop, I wrote

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.580
about the first tester at Microsoft. It's like, Oh, we'll have this guy. Oh, this is,

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.300
this guy does some cool stuff. We'll hire lots of them, lots of them. And then eventually figure

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:15.380
out, well, only a couple of these people are good and they, and, and this growth happens out of

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.500
letting a million flowers bloom or whatever. Like we'll come up with, we'll have way too many of

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.490
them thinking it. And at the time thinking it's the right thing. Then we realized, Oh yeah,

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:30.130
some of these people suck at this, but some people, if we can weed them out and nurture them,

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:34.690
actually are helping things go forward. So I think what you're saying is you're seeing the same thing

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:40.290
is happening. We're in the midst of that with data science. And I do think, I do think the,

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:48.670
the, the great data science calling C U L L I N G calling. Yeah.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:58.430
Yeah. We'll, we'll begin. That would be interesting. I think there are more and more managers I talked

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:03.790
to at Microsoft to realize, Oh, we don't, this was stupid to think we need a team of data scientists,

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:09.630
although you have one, but it's for a larger group, but that we need like a, just a few,

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:14.510
one or two really good ones. So what do you think actually may ask, what do you think the ratio

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:21.330
is? What do you think the dev to data science ratio is right is for a mature product? Didn't

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:26.510
mean to put you on the spot. I don't, I don't know if it's answerable. So there is a min.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:32.990
I would say there's absolutely a minimum and, and right. You gotta have one. No. So,

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:41.150
those who the, the, the one and a half reader who read my last blog posts will,

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:46.510
will realize that, that I do think that, that no matter if you're going to get into data science,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:52.430
you do need a minimum team of three to four people, but their skills are very diverse.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:02.050
But in order to scale, I want to say some, right. Making up numbers,

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:08.770
but something along the lines of like one out of a hundred. Yeah. It was a stupid, it was a dumb

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:13.570
question. And I think really that's the answer I wanted. It's as the team grow, you need a minimum

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:18.450
number. So you can get the diversity of skillsets because having one person that can do all of that

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:25.330
is, is impossible, impossible. See the minimum team to get the skills you need. But after that,

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:33.200
they can scale well. Cool. Were you done with that before I go on? On that one. Okay. So,

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.880
I mean, I have other things on 2016, but well, let me talk about my trend because it actually

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.120
disagrees. Dear trend a little bit. I don't know if we'll get to a tipping point in these roles things,

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:49.840
but the thing I was thinking of when I saw this, when I gave you this idea was

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:57.920
when did JW do the test is dead thing? It's been like five years, right? Four years ish.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.720
Doesn't matter. So I'm thinking more than five years. Okay. And blah, blah, blah,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:09.600
to metaphor, et cetera, et cetera. Ignore this part. So I had an interesting conversation over

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.720
Twitter. I'm not going to rehash it last week, which led to my latest blog post on roles and

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.600
fluidity. I'm not sure if you got a chance to read that. And with the idea that there are,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:27.550
I think there is a school. Oh, I can't use school. That's already, shoot. There is, uh,

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:34.430
belief system. No, maybe let's call it a, I'm not sure what to call it. There is a group of people

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:41.900
in software engineering who really truly believe that you are inclined towards development or you

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:48.060
inclined towards testing and doing both is you just can't be very good at it. I've had arguments

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:58.420
in the past and I round our great testers born or made. So I, and the answer is it depends,

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:04.180
it's a little of both. Uh, and I, as you know, I believe in generalized and specialist center,

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:10.850
et cetera. Um, I got a, uh, uh, DM and Twitter from guy used to work with the Microsoft's

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:15.250
known Amazon for a while. We stay in touch and a pretty cool guy. And he said, my post is actually

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:22.850
getting a lot of, it inspired a lot of, uh, great conversations over at Amazon. That's interesting.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:28.930
Um, because the idea is there's a group of people that believe that, uh, you can't, you

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.370
moving between those is the difference. And the argument I got in the Twitter, you can't do both

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:37.170
at the same time. I said, yeah, you can't do any two things at the same time, but you can move

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:46.510
fluidly between them. I believe that contributing to software engineering, uh, anyone can do.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.030
Anyone does every role, but there is flu. I'm not going to say, so I don't want to be

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:57.470
misquoted and say anyone can do anything, but they're definitely, I believe is ability to move

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:02.350
fluidly between roles, whether they would be traditionally considered a development role

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:07.550
or a testing role or a data analysis role or whatever. Do you have the ability? I could

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:13.150
work on a team and be Phil partially, I could be one of the roles that Brent describes in his

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:18.190
post on data science and also do some other skills, which may be testing or maybe development.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:22.990
I believe, and I wouldn't do them at the same time. I would move fluidly between those roles

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:31.820
as needed. So I think, I think the riff and discussion between those two groups is going to grow

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:40.620
a lot this year. I, cause I see, um, more. The fluids versus the solids. The fluids versus the

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.100
solids. So you can call it that if you want, cause I see more and more people talking about

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.940
this without using those words, but the fluidity of different roles, you know, whether they're on

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:54.700
agile teams or, uh, or not, or how they contribute to software in different ways. And I see the

00:41:54.700 --> 00:42:01.180
people in the other camp digging their heels in hard saying, no, in order to me, for me to be

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:06.140
a good tester, I can only test and I'm paraphrasing there, please don't yell at me, but, um, but I

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.540
do see them as the fluids and the solids. And I think the fluids and the solids that, um, it's

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:15.100
not going to be a war or a fight, but that riff, that point of discussion between those groups

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:25.840
is going to be prominent in 2016. I think you'll see talks about that. Um, if in keynotes at multiple

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:33.380
2016 conferences, what do you think about that? I dunno. That actually surprises me because,

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:39.220
because that implies that. So you're, you go on the, the conference scene, uh, way more than I do.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:46.670
Um, and I kind of would have expected that that had already come to a head. No, no, I'm,

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:53.390
but I'm just, I'm just starting to see it get to a point where there's enough critical mass on either

00:42:53.390 --> 00:43:00.990
side for there to be a healthy discussion. I won't call it a argument, but a healthy discussion

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:07.540
about pros and cons. So in some regards, this is, this is actually a problem that's happening on

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:17.820
my team right now. Right. So, um, I like this, this phrasing, I mean, the, the, the fluids versus

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:24.780
the solids, right. Um, in my last team, uh, as I've, as I've mentioned multiple times,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:37.280
I've helped multiple teams try to transition to, to agile. Um, and, uh, the last team, the argument

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:46.180
wasn't around fluid versus solid. It was around generalists versus specialists. And no matter

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:56.850
what I tried, I couldn't get the, um, the view was I rep, I represented the generalists.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:01.650
And I'm like, no, I don't know how to say this more clearly. I hate them both.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:15.360
Right. I, I'm not, but the reason why is because, uh, the, the people who were, who, who felt they

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:21.780
were against me were clearly on the side of specialists. And since they knew that they were

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.820
against me, they assumed you had to be a generalist. Yeah. Well, therefore, inductively, I was a

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:35.780
generalist. Um, it's like, um, when people asked me about politics, I'm like, the, I'm neither. So I,

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:41.940
I think I told you before I'm a libertarian. And one of the stances from a libertarian is I firmly

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:49.860
believe that both the Republicans and the Democrats are wrong. Anyway, anyway, the boring,

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:55.980
yeah. Where was I trying to get to? I don't know. Oh, so the, you think that's going to come to a

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:01.020
head? I don't know if it's going to come to a head. I think, and because a head means something

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:09.220
different than that. I think that I think the discussions and the, the, I think that you will

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:16.180
see a significant rise in the discussions between the fluids and the solids on, on software. This

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:22.260
is related to what I think is the biggest change that will happen at Microsoft. Great transition.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:30.110
What is that? Um, I say, I said, much like what I was saying around the rise of the crappy data

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:37.300
analyst, I think a new group will form where there'll be a battle between this, this, um,

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:45.380
craptastic data science. I think we'll start to see data science being scientific at the company

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:50.820
in general. It sounds like the same as your last, your last prediction. It is. But I, one of the

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:58.500
things that I think will happen, one of the consequences is I think quality orgs will die.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:07.340
Ah, that's that, that I like. Um, I do think, so what I put here, I think there'll be a glut of

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:12.620
amateur data analysts that will result in bullshit reports, data puke and a whole bunch of

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:18.300
inaction ability. I still love that term data puke. I use that on my boss and he paused like,

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:24.380
he goes, yeah, data puke. My boss loses it too. It's not my term, but I, I adore it. Um,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.760
and then I also think that we'll see a rise, unfortunately, of a bias beginning to flourish.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:40.100
That's known as the Texas sharpshooter bias. Can't wait to hear what this is. The Texas

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:47.380
sharpshooter bias. So imagine this as a metaphor. It's, I hope so. You, you, you got a, uh,

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:52.180
it's called the Texas sharpshooter bias. You can look it up on Wikipedia, but imagine a guy

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:59.700
shooting with his eyes closed at a barn. Okay. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And then opens his eyes,

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:09.060
looks at the barn and then paints the target where the best shots are. Gotcha. That's the

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:21.820
Texas sharpshooter bias. Okay. Uh, it's essentially, um, you, you find a group and then, uh, essentially

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:27.580
claim, Oh, it's significance, blah, blah, blah. And then I get it on that one clustering. Okay.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:33.260
I do also think that dev will still refuse to test their own code.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.620
I think they're going to move from refuse to have no idea how to do it,

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.060
which is a, which is a significant transition point. And I do think that,

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:51.300
but I do think the biggest prediction is that we will learn, um, a whole bunch of new excuses as

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:59.040
to why they shouldn't. Okay. I do think we are. So in terms of the fluids and the solids, I think

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.710
that I think your prediction of mine might be aligned because I do think what's happening

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:16.270
is, um, in my view, the solids here are their foundation of, of their fundamental base for their

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:23.550
point of view is neophobia. It's a fear to change. Hey, I've done this for 20, 20 years.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:28.830
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And none of you have been able to convince me it's broke.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:35.180
Therefore I'm not changing. And it's fine. Primarily fear-based, but I do think that there is a,

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:44.210
a stronger chance that, um, several groups, um, like the nice thing about fluids is we can,

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:49.090
we can encircle the solids. And I do think that these like, these folks will begin to feel trapped

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:54.380
and, um, it'll be somewhat like the cage tiger. And that's what's going to cause,

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.850
if anything, this battle that you're talking about, this battle that you,

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:04.450
this further entrenchment, um, the positive thing knows, though, I do think that when that

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:12.850
starts to happen, the fluids will outnumber the solids. Interesting. The last, the predicted,

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:23.920
this is my predicted positive surprise. Test teams that have shifted to dev as a whole team

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:31.310
and have spent the last year practicing the dev craft will begin to get noticed

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:41.600
and noticed as not only a force to contend with, but better than the traditionalist teams.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:51.650
Yeah, I think, and we've seen that, um, but not in general, not in general, I have seen from dev,

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:57.630
from tests, testers at Microsoft that have moved to dev positions, um, the good testers have become

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:03.790
the best developers on the team. And in many, many cases, I don't know that as a whole, all those tests

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:16.130
into a dev team, the, um, but a few of those teams will start to get noticed and, uh, for

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:22.130
their engineering excellence. Okay. We'll see about that. All right. So I hope you don't have

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:25.730
a long list for this because we're getting a little short on time, but, um, oh, I have to do

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:30.050
my biggest Microsoft change. And then, uh, maybe you're like your prediction of a software failure.

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:35.650
Oh, that was easy. Okay. I'm actually going to go a little less about engineering, a little more

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:39.650
about Microsoft and stock analysts, Mary Jo Foley. I know you're not one of the three,

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:46.770
so this is purely made up and I promise this has no, nothing from insight other than my experience

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:51.010
and my watching the groups at Microsoft. But here, I'm going to throw this out there

00:50:51.010 --> 00:51:00.500
just to be a little bit more broader and, uh, um, I dunno, um, what the right adjective is here,

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:10.320
but I think, I think 2016 is the year Microsoft stops, cancels development on Windows phone.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:21.330
I just want to throw it out there. Probably not going to happen, but I can think of a lot of good

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:31.630
business reasons to do so. Yeah. I'm trying to think of things.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:38.270
I have lots of thoughts here, but I don't actually know. Um, unfortunately,

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:43.970
I don't know. I want to say it now. That's it. And then we'll just leave it. And if it happens

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:49.090
again, we will have a special, I'll let you do that. But the things that I'm aware of,

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:52.530
I don't know which ones are publicly announced or not. So I'm just going to say,

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:58.690
huh, interesting prediction, Alan. Thank you very much. All right. And to close, um,

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:04.290
let's predict the biggest software failure of 2016 in advance. Again, we'll have a big

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:10.610
party if these happen. Brent, shoot. Uh, so I, I took software failure in a broad sense. Of course

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:25.140
you did. And I, I think this is the first leap year, um, uh, of note since, uh, uh, data science and

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:35.900
being counting has gotten so dominant and I'm expecting to see all kinds of interesting screw

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:43.730
ups as a result. Interesting. I think I predict there will be, so we'll, we'll, we'll note that. So

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:51.970
Brent predicts, if I can summarize very massive leap year bugs, but it may not be software bugs,

00:52:51.970 --> 00:53:01.340
right? It could be conclusion bugs. Yep. I predict that there will be a major software glitch,

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:09.710
failure, unreliability, or sec or security issue in tabulation and counting of the 2016 presidential

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:17.700
election. Yeah. And then that may not come out on election night, but within the weeks after

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:24.100
there will be massive controversy about some sort of software error or failure or hacking or

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:30.020
something, um, during the 2016 presidential election. The thing I do think, along those lines

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:40.140
that I do think I can very confidently say, um, this election will be the, uh, did you ever play

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:47.280
C robots? No. You know, this game? No. Okay. Old school game. You can write a little code

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:56.000
where it's basically little robots. Um, you can't visualize them. So it's just, I can implement a,

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.720
a class of code. You can implement a class of code and we can do, uh, robot wars. Although there

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:09.860
was no UI. It was all just, Hey, Alan's robot one, right? Um, I do think that this election is going

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:20.400
to be the battle of ML, the battle of machine learning, learning, like everyone now knows that,

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:27.920
um, Obama made predictive analytics and machine learning a big part of his first

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:37.580
election. And I do think all the sides are now going to leverage that. So, and to give myself

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:43.220
some, uh, leeway in my prediction, I'll say maybe that it can even come out. The controversy

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:46.980
may even come out as that maybe that one of the candidates, whoever we end up with running

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:52.580
head to head, uh, relies on that and it ends up their data is completely wrong or was hacked to

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:58.850
make them think they're wrong or whatever something big will come up. All right. Yep.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:08.830
And anything else, Brent? No. Oh, I think it's time to say, uh, save for so long till 2016.

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:16.940
So I, everyone have a great holiday. Oh, that was sweet. Yeah. Have a great holiday from,

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.980
from both of us from AB testing to you. Yeah.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.460
I'm Alan. I'm Brent. We'll see you in 2016. Bye.
