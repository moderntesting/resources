00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.360
Hey, I'm Alan. I'm here with Brent. Brent, say hi.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.320
Hi, guys.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:28.380
Hey, we are going to be crazy and try and do a podcast because we're, I have no, I was going to say we're really stupid, but what are we, Brent? Why are we doing a podcast?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.480
Well, you know, Alan, we're kind of learning and figuring that out.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:47.880
What we're experimenting on is whether or not this is a medium that will help ourselves grow as communicators and help the test community around us to learn and adapt and change with these changes that are coming on.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.800
Was that serious, man? I was just thinking we just want to listen to ourselves talk for a while because...

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.160
Well, there is definitely a non-trivial bit of that, Alan.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.780
Well, all right, we're going to give it a shot.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.360
Brent and I have a history of having animated cartoons.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.680
We've had conversations at Microsoft.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.700
We thought we'd try and capture some of those and share those with the world for as many as two, maybe four people.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.280
That's our goal.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.580
I don't know if we have goals yet.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.200
I think if we can get most of the architect group that we participate in, we could get even as high as six.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.140
We're going to be awesome.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.760
So if you guys don't know me, I'm Alan Page.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.800
I've contributed to a few books on software testing, try and stay active in the community, been at Microsoft for just about 20 years.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.460
And with me...

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.000
My name is Brent.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.260
And Brent, talk about yourself for a minute.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.740
I am Brent Jensen.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.180
I've been at Microsoft for the last 20 years.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.760
In the last, gosh, five years, I've followed Alan's lead and been an active blogger.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.060
I'm not quite as attached to the community as Alan is, but I'm learning from the master.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.000
I like to joke...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.640
You're in trouble.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.340
I like to joke.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.660
That I currently get tens of views on my blog every week.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.780
But it's okay.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.420
The tens that I get are important ones to me.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.860
So we have some topics on the whiteboard you can't see.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.800
We're going to kind of look at those and probably stray from them greatly.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.120
And we'll do this every so often and kind of see what happens.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.920
So how should we start this, Brent?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.780
Well, so just to carry on from that.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.300
One of the things that Alan and I...

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.660
Have been really starting to pick up throughout Microsoft.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.520
It's this concept of Lean Coffee.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.520
And that's how we'll start off these podcasts.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.100
So we'll generate a list.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.760
We may or may not share all of them with you.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.560
And we'll just go through the top in terms of what we think is the high priority that's of interest.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.860
New blog title.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.900
Alan and Brent.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.620
Lean Coffee Live.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.120
No?

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.060
Maybe that's the name of the podcast.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.360
We don't have a name yet.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.680
I thought it was A.V. Testing.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.580
Alan and Brent Testing.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.780
Yeah, you know.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.120
So on that theme, I'm...

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.340
Maybe both of our listeners can vote.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.100
Except it'll be you and I.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.220
Yeah, the thing about A.V. Testing, I like it because it's about quality.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.820
But it contains the word test.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.450
What's wrong with the word test, Brent?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.620
Well, we'll talk about that a bit later.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.420
Let me just say in terms of credibility.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.680
One of the things that I have done...

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.960
Most of my career at Microsoft, the title that I've worn is test manager for the majority of that career.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.940
I've been in test for...

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.480
I've held just about every position you can have with the acceptance of director.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.580
And my partner in crime here has held that title.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.900
Yeah, I was a director with five director...

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.140
No, six director parts.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.260
Director's director.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.620
But...

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.180
I don't even like managing people.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.180
The number one...

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.110
Change that has occurred in my life was when I gave up the title of test and I shifted over to Bing.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.210
And if there's anything that I could give the test community today as a gift,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.900
it would be the experience I had when I went to Bing.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.280
The number one thing that I learned is the difference between testing and quality.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:43.950
When I head over to Bing, I took on a dev role, but I still wore my test hat.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:56.190
And one of the most important things I learned very quickly in Bing is how little value bugs are when you're shipping every day.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.350
In Bing, everything changes every single day.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.270
You have...

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.550
Every layer of the stack, devs changing.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.370
You have the UI changing.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.570
Bing has a seasonality aspect to it in which what's important changes.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.710
So news today is not going to be the same news next week.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:30.170
And filing a bug just doesn't end up being helpful to moving the quality forward.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.110
But...

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.910
So I was going to ask a very leading and stupid question.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.410
Isn't it tester's job to find bugs?

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.830
It is.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.700
Over, Deb.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.080
I don't really think that.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.880
That's a neat take.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.840
I need the computer voice.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.080
Yeah.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.740
When you're in a test manager role, one of the key things that you often have to do is you got to do things like schedule test passes.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.800
Right?

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.640
And one of the things that I learned very quickly is, wow, if I were a test manager on this team, it would simply not work.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.760
We have a...

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.760
A...

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.240
A...

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.520
Several million test cases that are possible.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:25.060
And if we were to do a test pass in the amount of time that it would be valuable, we would need about a million testers to execute the test pass in about five minutes.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.940
Because all of that would change.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.000
Once that test pass was done, we would have some useful information, and it would be invalid ten minutes from now.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.620
But you have a million testers.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.550
That's...

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.070
That's...

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.830
So that leads into...

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.510
That leads into the next...

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.550
The next aspect.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.670
So...

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.690
This doesn't help that I know where Brent's going.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.810
I know what he's thinking.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.950
But there's a...

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.830
I'll interrupt for a second.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:59.980
There's a theme here that we'll probably end up talking about a lot, which is that how teams approach software engineering and the roles of all disciplines, especially the roles formerly known as testers, are changing quite a bit.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.740
Yeah.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.280
That's true.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.480
And one of the themes that both Alan and I very much agree with is that it's not only changing.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.760
But it's changing significantly for the better.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.560
That...

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.080
That...

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.940
My point of view on this is...

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:26.900
I think of James Whitaker's blog post from years ago, where he stated, all of that testing is getting in the way of quality.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.540
You know, you mentioned James Whitaker.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.920
There's a whole class of listeners just turned off the podcast.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.320
But we like James.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.060
Anyway, go on.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.220
So we went from two, and one just shifted off.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.560
Yep.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.250
So there was a...

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.070
We're going to dance at the end, so stay tuned.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.690
And it's a good thing that this is...

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.830
Maybe my job here is just knock Brent off his train of thought the entire time.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.210
Yeah.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:58.010
It's amusing for Alan, but I don't know that this is good audio material.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.350
It's fantastic.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.070
Go on.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:08.270
So there was a presentation that I did within the first couple of months to the test managers in Bing,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.250
where I communicated, wow, what you guys own is magical.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.300
We had 300 million test cases being executed every day.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.860
This is something, in my prior role as test managers, I could never do.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:32.740
In addition to that, they were exactly the test cases that needed to be executed that day.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.540
When you're sitting on top of millions of test cases, one of the challenges is you don't have the muscle to understand

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.200
which ones you don't need to execute.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.290
You, as a test manager, know you are wasting teams' time and business value

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:54.790
because you don't have the ability to know which of these test cases have no value to execute.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.580
In this Bing model, you do.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.200
It was fantastic.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.300
One of the things I want to be clear on, though, a test case, in my way of thinking,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.460
is a test case.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:10.500
A test case is a test case.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:10.660
A test case is a test case.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:10.680
A test case is a test case.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.660
An input being applied to some sort of program, an output observed, and a judgment being made.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.500
And this was happening, 300 million of these things were happening every single day.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.180
The one biggest difference, though, is it was being done by our customer.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.630
And the problem we had is on that last judgment call.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:41.090
We didn't have all the muscle we really needed to really understand what call they were making,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.330
what was the judgment.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:50.110
And as we move into more and more of a quality focus and away from a testing focus,

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:55.270
that's where I personally see us gaining a lot, a lot of muscle,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.690
not only in the industry, but particularly in our company.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:00.970
Cool.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.930
We're going to have to explore that quite a bit more as we venture down this role of recording us

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.290
giving each other crap on the Internet.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.580
So that's enough of me babbling for now.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.280
Alan, what have you been up to lately?

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.780
Nothing.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.220
No.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:23.450
Some people may know, after Xbox One shipped, I decided to follow my manager.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.230
He's a great manager, even if he doesn't listen to this podcast.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.870
And move over to this small team, sort of an incubation project, which is under the Windows umbrella.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:40.370
So I work in the Windows org now, which brings its own set of interesting human interactions and challenges.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.290
I'll leave it at that for now.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.530
But one of the things we did, we're making some big shifts in Windows.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.330
And if you are inside or outside of Microsoft or ever heard of the way Microsoft works,

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:59.270
hearing the word Windows making big shifts is either shocking or you don't believe it

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:05.670
or you think by a big shift, meaning, you know, we're going to do nothing.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.210
Change the startup screen.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.990
Yeah, we'll change the startup screen.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.060
That's funny.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.290
So we're changing a lot of the way we do.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:21.170
Windows is going to try and actually make software, like I put it, like the rest of the world does.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.330
Our developers, many who probably have never written a unit test in their life,

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.610
are going to write unit tests, functional tests, integration tests.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:37.290
One, because it's just damn more efficient for the author of the code to write those tests.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.270
And two, because we want to take advantage of some of the things we've learned from people like Brent and others

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.410
who have been in services for a while and apply some of those.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.850
So we're changing the concepts to testing desktop software, doing things like, you know,

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.050
we're going to flight, we're going to iterate, we're going to do all kinds of great things.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.070
I won't go into the details because I'm sure someone will get mad that the world now knows

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.630
Windows is going to make software really well, if all goes well.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.060
But we had, this is a big shift for a lot of people, so we did a quality day,

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:13.880
a one-day event where we talked about why we're making the changes, what it means,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.740
and what it means for the different disciplines and how your role kind of changes,

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.380
and lots of examples of that work.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.580
Early on, I worked on the committee for this, and early on we decided that,

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.240
well, the original plan was like seven one-hour talks.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.060
And whenever I go, every time I go to a conference and I start sitting in track session after track session,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:42.140
I go, man, if I ever host a conference, it's going to be all 30-minute or less talks.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.120
Because, you know, hardly anybody...

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.120
Nobody has, you know, has anything interesting to say for a whole hour.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.700
And there's also the aspect that Alan is riddled with ADD.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.570
Hey, Mr. Pot.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.500
Yeah.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.200
So, I don't know if...

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.060
Wait, is that a squirrel?

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:10.380
Anyway, so we had a, as I originally quoted it, a flurry of talks.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.940
We had an opening keynote that was 45 minutes.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.800
And then even vice presidents were limited to...

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.080
You know, anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.660
We kind of shifted times through the day.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.280
And a couple of amazing things happened.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.940
One was, we actually held, you know, more than 1,000 people, close to 2,000 people interested for a full day.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.180
And two is, you know, the talks went pretty well.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.140
People, like, felt like they got something out of it.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.160
And that's, you know, I've been involved with other internal conferences at Microsoft.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.280
And this one, I think, was...

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.820
Went really well.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.640
It was...

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.940
Some talks were 10 minutes.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.820
A lot were 15.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.280
A lot were 20.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.480
And it kind of told the story pretty well.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.260
There's...

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.040
Our goal, you know, coming out of that was...

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.000
Or going into that was, let's have fewer questions.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.620
Let's answer more questions than we generate.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.370
And getting rid of ambiguity is always a great way to help lead change in an organization.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.230
So, it went pretty well.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.090
I was pretty happy with it.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.990
I think there's still a long way to go and a lot to learn.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.930
But I think...

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.710
I think people have an idea of kind of what it means.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.830
Brent's raising his hand.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.410
Excuse me.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:21.850
Brent?

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:23.630
Bert?

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.490
Wow.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.770
First one, we're going to go that way.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.910
That's an inside joke.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:30.770
We'll talk about that later.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:37.210
So, you said something that I think is super interesting to me anyway.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.750
So, you said that it went really well.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.630
Did you happen to talk with a bunch of people?

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.090
I'm curious what were sort of the top five themes that came out of that?

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.510
Really?

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.530
What really resonated with folks?

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.900
The first thing I heard, the thing I heard foremost was the format worked.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.020
And that's...

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.400
I was involved and that changed.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.340
I was happy to hear that.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.620
As far as people taking away things, there is...

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.500
You know, at Microsoft, we have this three-discipline system.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.460
We have program management.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.860
We have software development and software test, which we call quality in Windows now.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.860
But it's the same thing.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.820
Trying to shift the mindset by the title.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.080
That's a topic...

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.340
Yeah, Brent just stabbed himself.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.860
So, you know where we stand on that.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.480
There was a good...

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.560
One of the things I love to do when I'm getting a new team put together is get the discipline leadership together.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.440
I talk about what their team does, what their expectations are for other people.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.340
And this was like a big forum version of that.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:40.160
In talking through what the roles did, we had a lot of opportunity for everyone in the room,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:47.660
all engineering disciplines, to understand what each other was responsible for and what new things they were responsible for.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.660
So, everybody's kind of...

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.540
So, everybody's kind of in it together.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.700
That was another big theme that came out.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.080
And people loved...

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.590
I'll do the third theme.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:55.790
People loved this.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:02.050
We had a ton of examples of where data-driven quality has worked and where, you know, making...

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.750
Not just the business intelligence part of understanding how users are using the software,

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:12.610
but building statistical models on our analysis and using that to make predictions on how customers review software.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.810
And examples of that, like, I think the scales shed people's eyes.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.270
And they thought, hey!

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.110
I think I get how this can work.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.330
Which, if you work in an org like Windows, is a huge, huge thing.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.430
It's a...

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.670
I'll just say it's a team deeply rooted in history.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.900
Yeah, but they are.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:43.540
They have a fine tradition of producing really great code at a really great cadence.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.800
The one thing I might say to our competitors is this.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.540
Despite what you think about...

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:57.790
About Windows, our people, we have a large number of people, and they are really good at execution.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:03.890
Once this culture shifts, they're going to be really good at executing in this new culture.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:05.940
Absolutely.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.580
Correct.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.300
We have smart people.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.220
We have good executors.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.430
Anyway, I don't want to get on the Microsoft rah-rah bandwagon.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.430
We have a ton of work to do, and sometimes it's frustrating, but it's...

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.430
Yeah, it's interesting to be part of this.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:32.370
I haven't seen a more exciting time in my career than the time we're in right now.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.930
I wonder if that's true across the industry.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.790
You know, I was talking about some of this stuff, and we're going to wrap up in a minute here for those of you that are extremely bored.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:45.550
But I remember talking about some of this stuff just about a year ago, about some of the changes we were making on my...

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.270
I think I was on Xbox then.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.150
Sorry, I had to think for a second.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.190
Okay.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.610
It's been a blur.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.270
So just so you guys know, Alan spent five years last year in Xbox.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.590
Yes, I did.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.170
It's all a blur.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.390
I should have got an extra five-year service award just for my two years on Xbox.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.930
Yeah.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.810
But I described some of the things, you know, right, this is where we need to go.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.970
It's cutting edge, da-da-da.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:18.790
I remember talking to someone outside of Microsoft, and the quote was, this would all be revolutionary if it weren't already happening.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.230
And I'm glad to get into the world here.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.650
And I'm excited.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.230
It's a fun time to be here.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:30.150
The positive thing for our company in this front is that it is already happening.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.830
There's lots of examples.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:41.610
We're well-motivated because several competitors are succeeding with this type of model where we're still struggling.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.890
That's a lot of words there, getting our butts kicked.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:45.800
Yes.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.990
All right.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.190
I think that's enough for today.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.570
We have lots more to talk about, but we'll get to it next time.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.210
Arlene Coffee.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.590
The coffee list is not exhausted.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.350
I'm Alan.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.010
Thanks for listening.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.990
And I'm Brent.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.950
And have a fantastic week.
