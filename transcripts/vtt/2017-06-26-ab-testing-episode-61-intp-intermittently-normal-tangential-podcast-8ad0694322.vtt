00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.500
Good morning, Brent.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.860
Good morning, Alan.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.540
It is time for episode 61.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.340
61.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.460
I count on Brent to remember those things for me.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.420
I don't know about you.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.930
I'm happy to be here and talk about testing stuff,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.150
engineering stuff, quality stuff.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.790
Sure.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.070
Let's do the podcast.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.470
You're such a dork.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.110
I love doing a podcast with you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.470
because it makes me seem cool.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.990
It really does.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.950
Yeah.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.310
I go back and I listen through them.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.110
That's because I'm in charge of editing.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.030
I take out all the dumb things I say

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.830
and add more Brent dumb things.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.830
Nope, no need to add more.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.550
There's enough.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.190
It's the privilege you get from doing the extra work

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.510
on the editing, yes.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.010
And that's OK.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.390
You actually come prepared, and you actually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.270
have insights and acronyms and things that are valuable

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.620
that I usually end up stealing if they're good,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.690
and then pretend I never heard of them before.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.970
Yeah, it's sort of the inventor's dilemma, right?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.450
So it reminds me of Book Plug.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.650
This is a very popular book.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.330
I'm sure a lot of the three have read it,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.940
but Austin Kleon's Steal Like an Artist.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.100
I've not heard of that.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.140
It's a good book to read.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.940
That's what I do.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.460
I steal like an artist.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.860
I have about 10 books I'm simultaneously reading.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.900
Oh, have you read?

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.740
I started reading.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.660
Which is a horrible strategy.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.580
I started reading.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.540
Now, Philippe Canoriam on one of the three Slack channel

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.060
just gave Brenton Isem nice tile devices.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.580
Yes, thank you.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.100
Thank you.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.620
Thank you.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.020
I have mine right here.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.620
He recommended a book, and I'm going

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.540
to mess up the title called Everybody Lies.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.790
Pretty sure that's right.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.510
A lot about data science and analysis.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.470
Dang cool.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.030
Dang cool.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.910
Not even all the way through it yet,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.670
but I stopped reading everything else I'm reading now

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.070
because I can get through this.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.150
It is, yeah, you should check it out.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.790
So far, it's a bunch of research based purely

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.510
on one of the most abundant and unfiltered sources of data

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.070
on how people think and what they're

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.950
thinking about around the world.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.890
It's Google search queries.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.650
Oh, interesting.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.090
Brent who worked in Bing goes, oh.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.410
So now I really got to look at this.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.460
In Bing, I found the data that I had just fascinating.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.780
And that's only on a tiny bit of the traffic

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.060
that Google is getting.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.580
Right.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.930
Zing.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.220
There were conversations when I was in Bing.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.900
We still hadn't done the combined engineering

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.340
all throughout Microsoft.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.300
And so I still had a lot of my lunch buddies

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.890
were like directors from Windows and things like that.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.910
And I remember going, OMG, do we have some interesting data?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.230
And I remember talking to, I'm not

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.420
going to mention his name, but it is someone you know,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.180
former director within Windows.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.310
And I said, do you think it would be valuable

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.700
if you had access to what users and at what rate people

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.120
are coming in and doing search queries for your features?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.360
Because, and I showed them right there and then,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.480
because I had permissions, I showed them right there and

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.160
then I'm like, look at this.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.360
Type, type, type, type, type.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.180
He's like, oh my god.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.300
Or, oh shit.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.180
Yeah, so it's taken a while, but one of the things

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.260
that I did then is I went back and I said, hey guys,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.460
we got to figure out a way to expose this data

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.740
to the rest of Microsoft.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.300
Because there is.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.780
What, if you think about it, what a massively valuable data

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.540
set.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.140
It is.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.620
And looking at some of the different ways,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.300
I mean, I don't want to give it away,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.020
but some of it was like a sucker punch.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.380
Like, oh, I see.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.140
It's because the story is woven very well.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.740
They start correlating some data and go, oh crap.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.100
Wow.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.950
That I did not see that coming, but yeah, that makes sense.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.630
There is on the topic of, when you said everybody lies

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.630
and then said it was a sort of a data science-y discussion.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.670
That triggered one of the concerns that I have around

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.860
what people like me are doing today that's going to

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.340
just completely change the world going forward.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.860
Now, a lot of us have this optimistic point of view,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.460
oh, there's going to be all these little AI bots.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.260
Everyone's going to have their personal Cortana.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.810
Or what, Cortana is in Halo, not Cortana is in the,

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.260
the voice user interface that Microsoft provides.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.020
But I thought I had a small little holographic woman

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.140
inside of my computer.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.580
Oh, that's when I use Windows at least.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.580
No, actually my older son, just as an aside to the aside,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.180
my older son had actually gone up

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.820
and looked up on the internet.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.060
And there's a bunch of Easter eggs,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.180
Easter egg questions you can ask Cortana.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.180
Ah, cool.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.020
For example.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.180
Again, using a search query,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.180
I think we just went tangent inception, loop back.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.100
So for example, you can ask Cortana,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.260
what does she think of Google?

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.540
And she says a very, oh, they did a lot of innovative stuff,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.220
but I use Bing.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.380
Oh, that's just stupid.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.740
I would just say they're a very successful

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.300
advertising company.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.860
The funniest one I remember is if you ask Cortana,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.160
will you marry me?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.840
But I'll leave that for the audience

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.080
to test it out themselves.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.600
Anyway, winding back up the stack,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.870
one of the things that I'm concerned with

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.050
is ethics is not standard curriculum

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.650
in data science training.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.130
It's not, this is actually what's interesting.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.010
And I've ranted about this before.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.010
I think the lack of critical thinking ethics

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.840
courses in STEM are hurting STEM.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.680
STEM.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.120
Yeah, this is my big rant.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.640
I try and shove a bunch of sciencey technology,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.440
math facts into students brains,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.360
but then they get to the real world

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.140
and they don't know how to use them.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.700
They don't know how to use them ethically.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.970
They don't know how to make decisions.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.450
There was a study I came across recently.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.130
We could do an all tangent episode.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.770
We're well on our track.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.850
There was a study recently that came out

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.850
that basically said valedictorians and salutatorians.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.710
Very rarely impact the world the way they are expected

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.750
when they're granted.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.830
Sure.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.430
And it's, in my view, it is the difference between

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.830
street smart and book smart.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.950
Knowledge and wisdom.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:53.890
Yeah.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.810
Anyway, one of the key things that I'm worried about

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.010
with data science is I think we're well on our track.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.060
If you think about where how the lens is going,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.340
you think about how far away we are

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.540
from just completely automating 80% of decision making.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.460
I think we're on our track to number one.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.940
Everyone will have a built-in lie detector.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.440
So if I have Google Glass,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.500
facial recognition is just going leaps and bounds.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.500
And computers can pick up nervous ticks

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.780
in ways that are imperceptible to us as humans.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.300
There's a lot of training that there's,

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.060
what are they called, mentalists.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.740
These are people who kind of have trained themselves

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.060
on understanding these nervous ticks.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.060
And they know if you answer and you look a certain way

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.890
that you're accessing a particular part of your brain,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.330
and that part of your brain is where creativity is stored,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.970
and that is a huge indicator

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.530
that you're not looking up information,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.370
but you're inventing information.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.170
There's a really good book on this.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.690
I read a year or two ago, but I cannot remember the name.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.030
There's like a 2% chance I'll look it up

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.730
and put it in the show notes.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.330
So if no one has the ability to lie anymore,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
and then you have all of these AI bots

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.410
making decisions for you,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.370
that kind of, whether you're religious or not,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.560
that kind of takes a big chunk out of this free will thing

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.280
that we're so fond of.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.720
So somewhere there is a techno-thriller built around

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.360
all these premises you just talked about.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.640
Yet this is something that is reasonably likely

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.160
we'll see in our lifetime.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.600
Yeah, because it's convenient,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.180
there's gonna be a lot of people that buy into it.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.540
It'll be interesting.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.940
Like people joke around about the sheeple nowadays.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.070
Just wait until you see two decades from now.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.430
That's going to be crazy.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:23.430
So I spoke at the online test conference last week.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:29.230
You did, I managed to listen to about half of your talk

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.430
and then I had to take my kid to school.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.350
I had a good time, it was a fun talk.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.270
It is always strange for me to give a talk

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.670
from when there's no audience to look at.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.910
We talked about that a little bit on the last episode.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.950
Yep. Take a shot,

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.270
because we talked about that before.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.030
But it was such a soapbox for me

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:51.250
that I had no problem ranting for the invisible crowd.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.370
Yeah, how did the, the thing I was most interested was,

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:00.530
that I missed was the profess Q and A session afterwards.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.170
How did that go?

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.770
So there, the Q and A was,

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.290
there were one, maybe just one question afterwards.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.530
There weren't a lot of questions during the talk itself.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.090
There was a special Slack channel set up for,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.130
Slack team set up for the event.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.690
And I answered three or four questions afterwards.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.930
And what was great also,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.460
we had more questions were asked,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.340
but many were answered by people already in the channel,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.050
who may have paid more attention than others.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.370
What sort of questions?

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.770
Well, from the absurd things like,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.330
is Alan saying we should write more automation?

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.490
And someone replied, no,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.290
that's the opposite of what he said.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.530
He very explicitly, yeah.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.090
I don't think they actually listened.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.290
Then I looked at the slides.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.150
One quick tangent there is,

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.500
people ask for my slides.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.780
I posted them.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.420
There was, I did a little interview for info Q,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.260
little email back and forth,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.780
but he said, hey, can I see your slides?

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.780
So I can form some questions.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.700
And I said, my slides aren't going to be very helpful.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.260
Yeah, I'm not a list of bullet points sort of presenter.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.050
But what else were the questions?

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.370
I'm just like, how do you,

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.690
more clarification on other things you could do

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.020
to become more air quote technical.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.220
Yeah, I think,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.660
I think the thing that you did

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.350
that was interesting there.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.750
Was not wear pants.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.030
Oh, that's a sec.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.870
Go on.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:31.050
Is you kind of brought the term technical

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.490
back to its roots, right?

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.450
Technical in context often just means,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.650
oh, you're a coder.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.330
Yeah, and I beat the,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.570
I wanted to beat the crap out of that concept.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.330
So I don't want to recap the whole talk.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.250
It's online.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.930
You can find it if you use Google.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.490
Bing may find it, I don't know.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.010
Or we can ask our crack editing staff

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.810
to include a link to it in this podcast.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.490
There is a three or 4% chance that'll happen.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.170
But I'll pass that down the road and see what happens.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.210
No, the thing I realize,

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.290
and you and I hadn't talked about this before you did this,

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.290
but I realized upon listening to your talk,

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.970
you're saying essentially,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.700
no, technical in your context is

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.500
the use of rigorous techniques

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.510
to, in this case, it would be testing techniques

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:40.280
that would advance the business goals.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.240
Yes, yes.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.080
Right.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.550
So in this context, right,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.150
a technical tester,

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:55.050
by definition, a new hire who just came out of college

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.530
and never heard of a test position before

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.370
is probably not a technical tester.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.530
Perhaps not, but I'm finding a lot of students

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.810
come out of college knowing how to use Git,

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.610
knowing how to, they definitely know how to use grep

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:12.480
to parse for things.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.080
I think they know, they haven't learned quite how to

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.360
apply some of the tools.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.640
Basic software engineering techniques, sure.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.440
But the testing techniques,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.660
what is the difference between ET and ad hoc testing?

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.660
Ad hoc is, I don't quite know what I'm doing,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.340
but I'm testing, I'm...

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.900
It's not even testing, I'm randomly going through Crap

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.180
and hope I find something.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.140
It's an Easter egg.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.660
Where exploratory testing is,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.740
I'm learning while I'm testing,

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.340
I'm trying new things based on what I've learned,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.540
I'm poking around, when I find a sore spot,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.140
I poke a little deeper.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.020
But generally, exploratory testing,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.140
in my view, exploratory testing,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.140
is a bit more structured.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.700
You kind of know what you're looking for

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.930
and you're trying to see if it's there or not, I guess.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:15.120
Whereas ad hoc, in my view, is you're just clicking around,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.400
relying on your observation skills

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.130
to notice something odd.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.090
Correct, I'm not sure why you're going there.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.720
No, because I'm basically saying ad hoc testing

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.260
isn't really testing.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.660
It certainly wouldn't be in the way you're framing it,

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.120
in my mind, it wouldn't be technical testing.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.640
I'm looking something up here

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.600
because I saw a Twitter exchange

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.960
that was begging to troll me,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.080
but I was busy and didn't play along.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.520
I'm seeing if I could find it.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.080
We're just gonna live here in Tangentville

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.600
and we may do less mailbags than we planned.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.560
But I think of all the terms in testing,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560
and they're all used a lot

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.080
and some are buzz wordy and some aren't,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.620
but Brent, what's black box testing?

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.590
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:15.590
Black box testing is where you test a system

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.150
without knowing how it's implemented.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.870
Sure, sure.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.110
And then white box testing is

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.750
a lot of times code analysis, code coverage,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.850
you're doing things at a lower level.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.570
And of course you can use tools in either state

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.530
to help you out.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.380
But I saw someone, they were talking about

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.820
whether full stack testing was black box plus automation,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.690
and he said, black box testing to me

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.970
equals testing done by a human

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.990
that is unassisted by any kind of tooling.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.790
So, yeah, I know, Brent made a face.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.070
But then it gets worse,

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.070
and I wanna just, cause it ties in technical testing.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.070
He says, so as soon as you start using browser dev tools,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.830
you've crossed into using tooling

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.830
to assist your testing, automation equals tooling.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.670
So, then he goes on.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.910
So it's like, whoa.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.430
Your world is shifted in a weird angle

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.710
in the wrong, wrong direction.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.550
So, I absolutely, I just, so many things wrong,

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.630
but I wanted to bring it up here

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.230
because it does touch on what it means to be technical.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.870
I think one of my testers on my team

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.030
listened to the presentation from Copenhagen.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.470
STE, I don't know if I've ever said this on the show,

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.010
but I have a combination of software test developers

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.750
and software test engineers, varying technical skills.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.070
And some of my STEs are very, very technical.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.270
They're former game producers at major AAA companies.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:47.710
They're indie game devs,

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.590
building and making their own games on the side.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.070
They're very technical,

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:56.070
but they're not focused on tooling or automation.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.260
Where was I going with that?

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.420
Oh, one of my STEs listened to the show

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.100
and liked what she heard

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.940
because being technical for testing

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.020
may mean you have a clue what to do

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.740
when you press F12 in a browser window,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.640
Debugger Tools.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.580
You know how to use a proxy like Fiddler.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.780
By the way, I didn't mention this in the conference,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.460
but Fiddler now has a beta for Mac.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.420
Really? Yeah, you can now use Fiddler on Mac,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.420
which is awesome.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.920
There's a tool people use on Mac called Charles proxy,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.540
which works pretty well, but Fiddler is,

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.800
Fiddler's very, very awesome.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.340
But just knowing how to use tools

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.110
to do better testing, that's technical.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.070
Technical, as I said, and you pointed out,

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.830
is just using the techniques or tools of the craft.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.760
In a nutshell, using techniques, that's technical.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.720
Yeah, but that can be an overloaded term.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.480
Yeah, it sure can.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.350
Ad hoc testing, in my view, is not a technique.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.110
And fortunately, I don't hear that term very often.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.350
Yeah, that's good.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.550
BlackBox, in this case,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.830
when I think about BlackBox versus WhiteBox.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.590
I don't even think about it, but.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.030
No, I do.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.270
So let me just go briefly on this.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.110
BlackBox, you don't know how it's implemented.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.110
So what you're trying to do

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.150
is without knowledge of how it's implemented,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.590
you're trying to determine is it,

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:34.590
is when the system gets inputs and it generates outputs,

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:40.590
are these outputs expected or reasonably expected

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.580
based off of the inputs?

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.980
Now, the reason why you do BlackBox testing,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.460
or the benefit of BlackBox testing, in my humble opinion,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.910
is it allows you to make sure you're not primed

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.640
by the assumptions of the implementation.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.350
It forces objectivity.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:11.270
Now, I think the more experience of testers

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.830
have the ability, they recognize this is a problem,

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.830
and they have the ability to accelerate

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.710
their forward progress by even with knowledge

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.190
of the implementation, blocking out

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.190
that the threat of invalid subjectivity.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.020
Right, this is one of the reasons for BlackBox testing

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.780
is the thing that you and I hear all of the time

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.660
as pushback to some of the things we were saying,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:49.660
which is, well, yeah, but devs aren't very good

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.940
at correcting their own assumptions,

00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.180
and you really wanna have an objective observer focus

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.580
on what invalid assumptions the dev may be making.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.620
We've stated over and over again that's a crock of crap.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.860
Yeah, and I actually went over some myths like that

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.340
in presentations like myth, devs can't test.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:22.380
Myth, knowing how to program skews your testing.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.900
Yes, actually, I agree.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.900
I mean, perhaps, but yeah, I mean.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.380
It does skew your testing.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.140
You will move a lot faster.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:37.700
A lot of these things are rationalizations,

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.780
so sharpshooter bias, it's a bias.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.900
It's like, hey, I am going to proselytize

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.540
with a rational argument the thing I want anyway.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:55.220
I think what we see a lot, I think it's very clear,

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.380
and if you listen to the show,

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.900
you know that we believe that testing is changing a lot.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.620
Actually, software engineering is changing,

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.620
and the bit of that that is testing

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.740
is changing very much as well.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.060
The way we make software, changing massively.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.860
I think there are a lot of these arguments come from people

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.620
who are resistant to that change.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.420
It's for job preservation, or they're afraid of change,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.220
or whatever, so they're digging their heels in,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.140
and they're saying, no, this is not happening.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.820
They're putting their hands over their ears

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.100
and screaming, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.980
but it doesn't matter, the world's changing anyway.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.740
If they don't, they can disagree,

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.570
but that's going to lead one place, unemployment.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.460
So some of these people are smart, right?

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.740
I mean, they may be, here's how I'll put it.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.920
These sorts of discussions around these changes

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.160
definitely triggered the fight or flight response

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.120
to a lot of people.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.960
Absolutely.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.640
If you didn't see the change coming,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.160
you didn't make steps to prepare yourself,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.540
and you realize, holy crap, I can't retrain

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.860
in the time in which this thing's gonna land,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.660
so the only thing I can do

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.660
is try to defend it from landing.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.500
Sure.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.740
It's human nature, and actually,

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.300
it's one of the things that drives me

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.980
to come and do this podcast,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:28.070
because there's still a lot of people in the world,

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.750
as we know, and even as some of the responses

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:38.340
we've seen from 60 or even from the online test conference,

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.820
the statement that we said that the world

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.340
of just providing information

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.620
and being satisfied with that is over.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.580
That's a shocking statement to a lot of these people,

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.130
and we're like, sure.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.450
At this point in time,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.490
I'm actually quite content shocking people,

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.980
because if they want to not be in the unemployment line,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.020
start doing something now.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.380
I think it's really important that, not just you and I,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.260
but other people who are living on this,

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.220
trying to live on the edge of pushing forward,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.900
continue to have a voice.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.740
I saw someone post an article a few weeks ago,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.980
kind of hedging around and saying,

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.340
maybe we shouldn't write so many GUI tests anymore,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.900
and we've all seen the testing pyramid

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.260
with the bit at the top for GUI tests,

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.860
and it's been there forever, yet now people are going,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.460
hey, maybe these GUI tests aren't worth the investment.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.980
I looked up when I wrote my GUI, Shmooey blog article,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.900
and it's just about exactly nine years ago,

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.740
and I might have been late posting it then,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.100
so probably something I thought about well before then,

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.060
if I was able to write a blog post about it,

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.820
but these things are happening.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.540
One last thing before we actually begin the show today,

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.660
is I do a lot of talks.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.960
I like giving presentations, I think it's fun.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.480
I like sharing my opinions and my rants

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.480
with those that will listen.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.480
I very rarely, with maybe one or two exceptions ever,

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.590
will give the same talk twice,

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.830
but this technical testing thing,

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.540
it's a talk that I think I would give again

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.220
in the right context, I gotta figure out where that is.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.300
I would, of course, it won't be exactly the same.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.500
I'll change some things around,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.020
but it's just, as the presentation started

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.820
falling in place for me,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.090
I realized how passionate I am

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.730
about getting rid of this myth

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.810
that technical equals coding,

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.170
and coding equals automation,

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.330
and automation equals GUI automation,

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.370
because I think that's just a horrible path

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.410
to lead people down, and it's not the way of the future.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.810
It's not going to help you out down the road.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.450
And I see so many posts on testing forums

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.890
and Twitter and here and there,

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.050
I'm a manual functional tester

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.770
looking to get into automation,

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.210
how shall I proceed?

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.570
It's like, oh God, the world is doomed.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:17.570
Coursera, C sharp Java courses, right there.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.520
I was really proud of 60.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.040
He's talking about episode 60 of AB testing,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.120
our previous episode.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.880
And it reminded me of a lot of the conversations

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.280
that both you and I had when Microsoft

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.800
was in the middle of this.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.860
One of the challenges,

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.920
so you and I both grew up in tests,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.600
and we're both strong proponents of unified engineering.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.460
That's a threat to the test discipline.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:58.330
And one of the things that you and I are saying,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.130
or at least I'm saying, I think you agree,

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:06.610
is that test discipline is not inherently valuable.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:13.010
It's the output of the skills of the people

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.580
that make up what we currently isolate

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.890
as its own discipline.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.510
Now, I grew up in tests,

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:27.730
and I do feel a sense of membership to that community

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.330
and a sense of leadership or responsibility

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:33.170
to that community.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.730
Like when Microsoft was in the middle of this,

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.870
my job, when I saw a lot of these people in panic,

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.770
my job was to show a path forward

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.170
and to bolster the element of hope around that path.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:53.010
I'm like, look, this move doesn't eliminate

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.830
everything that's valuable about you.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.880
One of the things that, and I've said this here,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.110
when I get done babbling, I'll take my shot,

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.650
but I have lived in a dev world

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.890
where I did these combined engineering,

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:17.890
and I have lived knowing that those people

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.720
who have the ability to code

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.960
that grew up in tests and understand those skills

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.200
are actually better developers.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.040
Like, it's been my experience hands down.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.680
Those people who started with tests

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.100
understand this model, added the coding skills,

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.390
they are stronger as developers in this new world.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.530
One of my test developers, S. Detz,

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.130
borrowed term from Microsoft, I kind of resent it,

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.860
is doing mostly development work.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.820
In fact, we're looking for eventually,

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.660
probably the next six months,

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.100
we'll find a dev job for her at Unity.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:06.000
Former tester, the most conscientious test writing developer

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.600
that I know at Unity, because she gave the pack,

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.440
she writes great tests for everything,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.160
it's ingrained, like, of course, of course you write tests.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.120
Of course you write really good tests

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.080
when you're writing code.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:19.920
Yeah.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.680
It would be dumb not to, they get that.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.160
I have a weaving story here that I haven't talked

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.960
to anyone about this before, but I'm gonna bounce it off.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.760
You and the three listeners,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.680
Brent, you may remember when I worked on Xbox One.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.520
I do.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.360
I do.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.200
I had nobody.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.640
You joined, right, when I left.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.870
I joined, right, as it was starting up, yes.

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:44.070
I had no one reporting to me for the entire Xbox One cycle,

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:49.070
but I was responsible for growth and technology sharing

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.390
in community for, at first, just the Xbox One console team,

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.510
and then I expanded across live, and then across games.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.830
So I had, I managed a community of people concerned

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.190
with Xbox One quality to make sure we all knew

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.850
about tools each other were using to find connections,

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.550
to make sure the smaller team

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.470
of very senior technical testers,

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:19.470
I was sort of the product manager for Xbox testing tools,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.670
that we knew what the needs were,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.350
very much like a test manager, test director role,

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.990
except I was doing it all through,

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.910
they weren't reporting to me.

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.410
So, which I'm fine, totally comfortable with.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.290
So now at Unity, and I hope my boss isn't listening

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:38.970
because he'll shit his pants.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.910
And this would be a long, long-term thing.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.310
Nothing would happen in the next even year or two.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.270
I've been thinking more and more about my organization.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.790
It's a matrix organization where I have QA people embedded

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.860
in feature teams, yet all reporting to me.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.500
And the reason they report to me,

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.740
I've talked about it before, is I run a,

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.620
this is gonna scare the people that listen

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.320
to the podcast that work for me,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.380
but I'm gonna go on with the thought experiment.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.420
Most of them are embedded in feature teams,

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.140
they work for me, and I run a community.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.540
It's all good, Alan Skyes.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.780
Just talk to him afterwards and he'll set it.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.860
So I run a community of testers,

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.860
and so I can find ways for them to connect

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.380
and to share tools and technologies.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.220
We need to get a lot of that.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.020
This, by the way, is why you don't tell your team

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.860
that you do this podcast.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.860
I did not tell them they found it.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.060
Of course, I believe in total transparency,

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.820
so my calendar's open for anyone to see

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.260
exactly what I'm doing all day,

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.540
and then 8 a.m. every other Friday, there's podcasts.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.940
Oh, it's just podcasts.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.420
Nothing, go away.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.740
And they search for Alan Page Podcast,

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.020
and they go, oh, hey, pop the stack.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.420
Again, at UNITY, I run a community of testers,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.740
they're embedded.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.960
There may come a point, and I don't,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.600
again, I don't know if this will happen,

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.150
but logistically, I could just merge

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.350
many parts of my team into the dev org,

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.510
set them free, but still run that community of testers.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.390
They don't need to work for me to be

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.950
the quality and testing expert on that team.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.570
There are some advantages to that

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.810
for the short and medium term,

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.730
but I could see a world, and again,

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.370
one thing, if I was an old school test manager,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.850
I'd be afraid to death of that,

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.570
because I need my org to prove my existence.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.010
I think in order to do that,

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.370
I would one, have to get them to a level of independence

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.810
and have that community strong enough

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.330
where they would come back to it,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.850
even if it wasn't a community based on reporting structure.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.370
Before you can abandon the matrix,

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.370
you do have to make sure,

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.410
a huge portion of these have been

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.490
sufficiently taught leadership.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.690
A lot, this would be a long term thing,

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.610
it's kind of, it's a little sparkle in my head,

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.410
one of those background threads that

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.690
may pop up for me to think about once in a while,

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.490
but I could envision an org,

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.010
and I have to also build trust

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.650
among the dev managers and my managers,

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:14.210
other people in the org that I can justify my job,

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.850
and maybe I don't, maybe I work myself out of a job.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.290
It doesn't matter.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:24.010
What matters is that we have the most efficient way

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.210
to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:30.250
I have found that literally every time

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.760
that I automate myself out of a job,

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.800
I attract the interest of hundreds around me

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.160
that want me to go and solve a harder job.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.480
Yeah, and I really do see,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.360
I want my role to be one where I can just

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.040
make everything better,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.520
and that's a horrible way to put it,

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.960
but I wanna make, improve us,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.400
I wanna advance things, I wanna challenge people.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.870
If I do that to an extent,

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.870
that what I do the role I was hired for

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.150
is no longer relevant, that's okay.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.470
That can happen, I'm not scared of that.

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:13.950
And then tying that back to what we were talking about earlier.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:16.230
Unless you're a geezer, so it'll probably be

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.390
time to retire by then.

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:20.430
I can do this one or two more times and I'll be dead.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.790
Yeah, actually as you were talking,

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.510
one of the things I was thinking about,

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:29.760
so I'm not the only person to ever manage

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.560
a dev team of combined engineers.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.880
I know, unified engineers.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.720
Whatever.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.280
Actually, and that's actually an important distinction.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.780
Because I have seen tester folks being incorporated

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.580
under a dev manager,

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:55.090
and that person ran it like a combined engineering team.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.610
You know, it was a burden,

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.650
oh no, I gotta manage these test guys.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:04.270
The difference that I took is I'm like,

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:07.230
no, what I need is a unified engineer.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:12.070
I need people that can do code and do testing.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.670
And I know I've talked about this story,

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.500
but by realizing that what I need to do is,

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.140
all I needed to do with these test guys

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:26.460
is remove that lack of self-confidence

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.840
that is brow-beaten in the testers.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:36.320
And once I did that, these guys were rock stars.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:43.050
Now, what I have found though is leadership matters.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.540
So if they get re-orged into somebody

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.140
who says something along the lines

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.340
that starts with, pick your favorite sentence,

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:58.660
but starts with, I've been doing this for the last 20 years.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.980
If you have moved these guys into that

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.200
they had not been taught leadership

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.560
in a way that defeats this lack of self-confidence

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.440
thing I mentioned.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.060
Just gonna put them in a worse situation.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.420
So yeah, now Unity sounds like it's a lot more

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.760
closer to an ideal world.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.820
And to be clear, there's a massive room for advancement.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.360
To catch up to some of these things,

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.360
but their ability to move quickly is very, very strong.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.750
You have to have a way to make sure

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.590
that when the unified engineering model happens,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.590
or something along these lines,

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:55.260
to make sure that they're viewed as an asset,

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.580
not a detriment.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.820
Sure, and again, it's not like I don't want,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.860
I don't want so many people reporting to me,

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.500
I'm gonna push them off to the dev team.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.660
Not my goal at all.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.300
I think they'll become a point

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.740
in it'll be different paces on different teams

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.980
where it just makes more sense for them to vote there.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.900
They have the autonomy they need,

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.420
and I can still swoop in.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.340
If you back that up to, compare it to

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.500
when I was on the Microsoft Teams team,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.300
there were no, it was unified engineering.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.700
I was hired as the quality guy.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.820
There were no QA people embedded on the teams.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.160
So I had a different problem to solve.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.640
I had to do it the other way around.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.680
I had to coach and train people

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.640
how to think like a tester,

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.400
and find the people who are good at it,

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.920
and make them, Microsoft called it the dotted line report.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.000
Basically just to have,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.760
exhort some leadership over them.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.760
Empower them to be the quality and testing expert

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.120
for that team, whether or not

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.800
that was their official role.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.680
Every feature team had, at first at least one,

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.580
but sometimes one, two, three, four, five people

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.380
who were actually got how to write good tests

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.460
and cared about it,

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.260
and had a level of craftsmanship to their code,

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.620
and then would evangelize that across their team,

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.380
and ask the right questions during code review about tests,

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.820
and make sure they had the right balance of tests.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.180
So I did it the other way where I built them.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.420
That way works.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.460
I actually,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.700
But it's slower.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.940
That was fun to do,

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.100
because it was a fun little challenge for me to do that.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:26.940
It's slower.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.540
I like having the QA team.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.100
I've enjoyed managing this team.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.140
It's been a ton of fun,

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.580
but also I'm just throwing this out

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.980
that we'll revisit this in episode 97 or something.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.940
But I could foresee downsizing my team

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.980
in favor of the efficiency of our ability

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:53.050
to get quality features to our customers efficiently.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:57.190
Yeah, and again, to Alan's employees,

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.590
he means downsizing the number of people

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.510
reporting to him,

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.620
but the rest of you will be working in the dev org.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.860
There's no job loss being discussed here.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.580
And by the way, episode 97 is at least

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.260
two, three years away maybe?

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.320
In a good, yeah, I kind of think, yeah.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.160
We'll see.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.360
So again, don't be scared.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.620
Just, the thing is my team already knows

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.540
I'm full of totally random thoughts.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.300
I have a very agile approach to management,

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.540
means I'm gonna ship early, ship often.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.100
So, and those are my ideas, shipping early and often.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.420
So I'll throw stuff out.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.980
If it sticks, great.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.220
If it doesn't, I don't care.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.060
My feelings aren't hurt.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.380
I'll try something else.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.060
And I've had many, many thoughts in my life

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.500
of things, oh, maybe I'll think about this,

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.540
that I've just never done, never happened,

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.440
and that's okay, and I'm okay with that.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.920
You're an INTP, right?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.480
I am an INTP.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.320
As am I.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.440
And for those who aren't familiar

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.800
with the Myers-Briggs psychotyping testing,

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.900
this is essentially a model that generalizes.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.540
It's not a exercise of putting people in a box,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.980
but it generalizes how people make decisions.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.980
And when I walk through the difference

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.660
between a P and a J,

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.340
I'm not gonna go through the whole speech.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.620
Perceiving or judging.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.460
Right.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.300
But I'll just.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.660
So the whole process, INTP,

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.380
and I am an INTP as well,

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.660
the whole process is about the decision-making process.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.580
The first one is I versus E,

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.100
actually talks about what decisions

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.580
you're interested in thinking about.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.240
N versus S says,

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.510
how do you collect data?

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.860
T versus F is around the decision-making process.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.820
What bar do you use to make a decision?

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.100
T's are thinkers.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.940
And F's are?

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.780
Fred and I are thinkers.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.860
We think about crap all the time.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.060
All the time.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.220
But P's versus J,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.700
the thing that's interesting about that is,

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.380
once you've made a decision,

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.060
how do you stick to it?

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.300
And the way I describe the difference between the two

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.110
is you can think about a decision tree.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.860
J's, once they make a decision,

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.460
they prune the rest of the tree.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:44.460
If you know about game design and tree pruning,

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.300
once they made a decision,

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.820
they abandon the tree that they no longer need.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.700
Okay?

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.090
Whereas P's always keep the tree,

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:01.830
but for us, it's a balanced binary tree.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.610
So when we make a decision,

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:08.780
we actually reweight the tree and rebalance it.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.380
And so when new information comes in,

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.420
we go into the tree, rebalance it,

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.620
and now a new decision is made.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.340
So P's are viewed as being spontaneous,

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.540
or the negative side is we can't stick to a decision,

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.520
but really what we're doing is we're adapting.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.880
Yes.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:37.880
Now, there is no positive negative to being a J or a P.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.760
P's, in a world where you have to constantly adapt,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.230
P's are quite good at it.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.990
But the challenge with P's is,

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.070
if our tree gets too big,

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:53.510
it mentally can be a challenge to rebalance the tree.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.590
I mean, it's not actually a balanced binary search tree,

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.930
it is, that's just a metaphor.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:04.670
J's though, if they're forced to re-decide something,

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.110
what do they have to do?

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.630
They have to rebuild the tree in order to prune it again.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.390
So that's why you'll see them getting really frustrated

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:15.550
when a decision gets unmade.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:18.630
So a couple things, a bunch of things.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.310
Actually, one is you can wave your arms

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:24.750
around Myers-Briggs types indicator being a horoscope,

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.430
be whatever, and if you take like the online test,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:31.780
it's gonna be probably inaccurate to some extent.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.940
I think Brent and I have both taken

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.420
like the long form written test.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.400
It's fairly accurate many years ago.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.860
I wanna read a little bit about the INTP

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.980
for our listeners in a second,

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:43.820
but it reminds me, long time listeners will know

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.660
that one of my favorite authors in the world,

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.300
a man I have a huge man crush on, Stephen Johnson,

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.940
in his book, Wonderland,

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.770
talked about the fox and the hedgehog.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:56.510
I do not have, I have listened to the podcast,

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.690
I do not have the book.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.250
So it's actually in the podcast as well,

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.410
but the fox and the hedgehog

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:05.770
is basically how people approach learning.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.570
And the difference is the hedgehog has one world,

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.080
he just sees it.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.320
And the fox is always learning and adapting.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.760
And it tells stories about how important,

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.880
and the Wonderland's all about

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.680
the importance of play and learning.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.800
Talks about how the fox, the mother fox,

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.680
will actually bring back live prey to the den,

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.640
let the young fox play with it before he kills it and eats it.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.480
Little gross for Friday morning.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.020
The difference is the fox sees everything,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.480
and they adapt as things come on,

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.320
and they're always learning.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.820
They have a more plastic brain.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.360
And Brent and I are always,

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.120
maybe this is reflected in our ability to have ADHD

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.160
and bounce all over the place,

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.240
but we're always thinking,

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.840
and sometimes the thoughts are so strong,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.760
we can't resist them.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.840
And pretty soon, there's a squirrel with a balloon

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.520
on top of a truck or a train.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.720
With a ringmaster hat on.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.560
So I'm gonna read a little bit about us.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.080
I think his name is Petey.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.280
So you can get some insight.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.120
This is a definition I have,

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.880
I guess this is the first hit on Google.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.290
The INTP personality type is fairly rare,

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:14.070
making up only 3% of the population,

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:15.810
which is definitely a good thing for them,

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.050
as there's nothing they'd be more unhappy about

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.090
than being common.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.390
INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:24.690
and creativity,

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.490
the unique perspective and vigorous intellect.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.490
I know I'm pretty dumb.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:30.970
Usually known as the philosopher,

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.850
the architect or the dreamy professor,

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.210
that part's pretty good.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:35.810
The INTPs have been responsible

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:38.170
for many scientific discoveries throughout history.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.890
I don't actually like that definition very well.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:44.010
One thing I read about INTPs early on

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.690
that kind of hooked me on, oh wow, yeah.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.010
Says INTPs abhor inefficiency.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.590
And that's me to a T.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.080
It depends on how you define inefficiency, right?

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.440
Because I do not.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.400
This is Brent thinking.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.560
I do not abhor laziness,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.960
because I live that way.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.840
What's the Heinlein quote?

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.320
Something about progress being driven by lazy men

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.800
trying to find an easier way.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.100
Right.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.740
So nothing wrong with laziness.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.730
And often, I mean, automation is laziness.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:19.570
Like I'm too,

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:23.850
I'm too lazy to write, to do this again,

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:24.930
I'm just gonna write a script

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.250
or something to help me out with it.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.970
Oh no, so that's absolutely true.

00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:31.110
Like there are times where I have gone against,

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.930
this is back when I was still in IC,

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:33.770
I've gone against,

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.410
my manager explicitly told me,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.960
I don't want you to automate this.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.920
But the next three weeks,

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.200
you're gonna be running the same 100 test cases every day.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.920
And I've told this exact same story.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:45.760
Kill me first.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.640
I had the same manager.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.120
Because I was, I told the story,

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.240
I think I told it during my talk,

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.920
that that was my first, maybe I did,

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.120
my first day at Microsoft.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.020
Yeah, I mean, I definitely don't like repetition.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.440
The one thing in that thing though,

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.560
that I think does resonate,

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.460
the label of architect.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.640
Right now, to some people,

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.160
this means a technical design.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.880
And yeah, I'll do that.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.880
But lately, I'm doing a lot of process architecture.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.120
I'm going, no, actually the tech side of this

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.040
is actually pretty efficient right now.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.040
The bottleneck is all these damn people

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.520
using processes invented in 1995

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.400
for a world that no longer exists.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.040
I like thinking it that way.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.640
And the architect for me is the systems thinker

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.140
looking at all the pieces at once.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.820
That's what foxes do.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.120
Look at all the pieces at once

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.220
and then they'll make decisions and adapt.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.020
I have noticed in,

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.480
now that I know my team pretty well top to bottom,

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.380
managing them is a little bit of an architectural task

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.920
in some ways.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.680
I compared it this week a couple times

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.020
to playing a big game of slide 15.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:00.860
I don't know what slide 15 is.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:04.000
Slide 15 is the box of 16 squares.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.320
You have 15 tiles numbered one through 15.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.680
You have to slide them around to get them in order.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.080
Oh, sure.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.080
That game is called slide 15.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.880
Okay.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.320
Because I'm thinking, okay,

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.080
I want to be able to do this work here,

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.280
but in order to do that,

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.200
I need to make this person do this and that.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.800
So it's a lot of,

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.480
and they have a backup plan.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.460
Because if they do that,

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.120
oh then they can go there.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.240
And it's kind of fun.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240
I know what you're talking about.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.280
It reminds me of solving technical problems,

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.680
but I can apply the same thinking generally

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.680
to making sure the best thing happens

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.640
for the team overall.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.880
I kind of view that,

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.640
like my metaphor for that problem

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:51.800
is pick any game you've ever played that has a tech tree.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.760
Yeah.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.600
Right?

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.780
It's essentially, okay, what can I do now?

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.900
What do I need to be able to do?

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.660
Now, what resources do I need to apply

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.900
in order to unlock that next technical advancement

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:13.100
on my self-visualized tech tree for my team?

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.940
I'm in knee deep in planning right now.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.940
So I am doing a lot of thinking through

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.860
what are all these possibilities,

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.100
but at the same time,

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.760
sort of writing down things in a firm fashion.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.580
And as a P, I hate that.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.320
So also in Wonderland, Stephen Johnson,

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.600
this is I think gonna,

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.200
not didn't quite have the tech tree,

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.840
but a good example of systems thinking is SimCity.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.090
Yeah.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:45.810
In order to do one thing,

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:48.130
you have to do a bunch of other things.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.530
They can relate to other things.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.690
You get all those,

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.570
it's managing that is a good systems thinking problem

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:59.250
that is fun for some and infuriating

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.050
or even stupider boring for others.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.690
For me, I would love it if they released

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:11.690
another version, an up-to-date version of SimCity.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:16.690
I lost a whole day of my life back in college.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.610
Long story short,

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:24.570
I got so involved in this game during college,

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.930
I finally got done, got up,

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.090
went to go talk to my buddies

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:33.130
because we were all supposed to go to the bar tonight.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.330
And they're like, dude, that was yesterday, where were you?

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:40.400
And I'm like, what?

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:45.910
Yeah, so shall we start the show?

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:50.910
The good news today is that looking at the board

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:53.990
of the topics we're going to get to,

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.870
episode 62 is completely planned.

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.430
Yes.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.270
Two weeks in advance, at least.

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.590
That's pretty fantastic.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:03.910
So one of the things that I'm starting to think through

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.710
because I talked without-

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.510
But to be clear, I enjoyed the conversation.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:09.240
That was great.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.320
I actually think,

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.320
so now, one of the things that I wanna do

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.660
is go and retroactively title our episodes.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.640
Because we get enough of them and we get questions.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.480
I'm like, oh, go listen to episode number,

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.360
I don't know which one it is.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:34.740
And I'm tentatively gonna title this one,

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.380
Something Around Retrospective.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.740
Like this is sort of the 60 retrospective episode.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.060
Yeah, but we, it was,

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.770
I like the term tangent inception.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.450
Tangent inception?

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:50.770
The tangent inside of a tangent inside of a tangent?

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:55.010
Yes, the inescapable tangent tree.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:56.610
But fun stuff.

00:51:56.650 --> 00:52:00.650
Okay, so we'll do an all mailbag show next time.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.490
Yeah.

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.650
Cool with that, unless anything awesome happens

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.210
in the world of software for that we preempt ourselves.

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:08.090
Or in case we just start talking

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:09.970
and never get to the mailbag like we did today.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:13.210
But for now, we'll plan on an all mailbag show

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.050
next time we have at least three questions

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.010
for the mailbag.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.410
If any more come in, we'll try and see

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:18.850
how many we can shove in and catch up.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:21.410
So if you asked the mailbag question

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:25.010
and we didn't get to it and you think you guys are lame,

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.450
we apologize and we'll do it next time.

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:28.530
Or we'll plan to do it next time.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:29.450
We'll do our best.

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.170
Yeah, we go through all of them so far.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.280
Yeah.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.120
Okay, thanks Brent.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.120
Thank you, Alan.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.000
We'll see you next time.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:37.840
Bye.
