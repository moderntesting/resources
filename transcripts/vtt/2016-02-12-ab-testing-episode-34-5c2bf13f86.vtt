00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.480
Good morning, everybody. Hello, I'm Alan. I'm Brent.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.480
Go back for episode 34 of A.V. Testing. Welcome.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.570
Good morning, Alan.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.090
Thanks for coming out my way this time. Hey, good morning, Brent.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.410
It's my pleasure to come out your way.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.130
I think loyal podcast listeners, each of the three know

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.290
that we generally record first thing in the morning

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.930
when people really shouldn't be awake and to make it more interesting

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.010
and for added benefits, et cetera.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.690
If you're going to read your laptop and not actually speak into the microphone,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.540
I'll crush you.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.790
I'm getting over a cold, so I may be distracted even more easily than before.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.990
But yeah, so how you been, Brent?

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.190
I'm just fine. Shall we begin?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.670
People will be so disappointed if we just begin.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.390
All right. So I threw out a couple of questions

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.750
to internal alias and things that I had observed over the few weeks.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.230
And you said you wanted to discuss him here.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.150
And frankly, that's why I threw him out there anyway, because I was hoping

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.940
we could talk about them.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.540
So the first one is and I've

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.260
I've actually blogged about a different flavor of this many, many, many years ago.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.500
And I really was just referring to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.060
article that Eric Sink wrote even longer ago

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.620
where he talks about two types of people in the world.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.620
Those who know that software ships with known bugs

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.580
and those who can't believe it.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.580
I think anybody listening to this podcast realizes that, oh, yeah,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.260
software ships with known bugs.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.540
But this is a variation of that.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380
I mean, if you were to talk to someone off the street and say, you know,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.820
it's just say, hey, that'd be a stupid question to ask them when someone off

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.140
the street is like, hey, do you know that software ships with bugs?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.540
Of course it does.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.820
And anybody that ships software knows we make choices.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.900
But there's a flavor of this that I have seen.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.940
Can I ask a question? No.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.260
OK, OK, go ahead. Yeah, actually, you can.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.700
Did this this Eric fellow, did he state this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.390
in which decade recent or I believe it was the 90s.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.860
OK, so anyway, back then, I think I and a whole bunch

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.380
of testers would have been indignant with the idea that we ship bugs.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.150
We all knew we did.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.530
Yeah. But there's a flavor of this.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.770
I've seen actually from testers in the industry, as well as from some teammates.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.170
I'm going to kind of see if I can weave that story together

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.890
with some examples, maybe, that are totally almost made up

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.370
or at least paraphrased because I can't remember them.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.850
Hey, folks, software ships with bugs,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.970
especially today when the idea is

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.650
if there's a bug and someone finds it, you fix it immediately.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.130
And if there's a bug that is never discovered by anybody,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.180
it's not really a bug if and you can.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.980
It's a software error defect, whatever you want to call it.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.620
But it doesn't affect the usability or the experience of the user at all.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.540
If it's never discovered, I would state, though,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.100
because I think one way to interpret what you say is

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.380
this is something new today.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.180
And I would argue that's always been true.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.420
No, I agree. It's always been true.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.480
All right. So I'm not. Yeah.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.420
So for example, I remember a couple of years ago,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.840
I can't remember who some tester was

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.040
astounded that I can't remember if it was

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.560
WhatsApp or Skype or one of those messaging apps

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.480
when they put in over 32000 characters into their field

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.860
that the extra characters were not sent.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.400
Oh, and you know what? That's a bug.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.000
But they were screaming about data loss and which technically it is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.120
struck my shoulders and shake my head a little bit.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.020
It's funny that the learning from that, I just I knew it was wrong.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.540
I didn't know what to do about it.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.060
And then let's ignore it.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.660
Let's fast forward to today on my team.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.100
So we have a team of no testers unless you count me. I don't.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.300
All right.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.620
So we have these pretty senior PMs and devs who they see a bug

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.450
and they freak.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.730
Even the devs.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.010
Sometimes even the devs.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.290
Oh, tell me a story about that.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.690
That would be great.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.610
A dev manager.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.890
We're trying to decide if the team if build is

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.170
we did a big product reset and we just want to get the team dog

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.050
fooding our product and using our product for communication every day.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.370
And I said, we got to go.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.130
This one's this one's good enough.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.570
It's a little rough around the edges, but we've got to tell the team to start.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.130
We can start.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.730
And he does like two or three things and

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.770
one of them doesn't quite work and he goes, no, it's totally broken.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.200
We can't do this.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.920
And we stop and talk through it.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.160
And and we look at the context

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.800
and the nature of the bugs, the bug.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.960
There are all bugs, as you know, are not created equal.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.320
There are thousands, if not millions of different intricacies and context

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.680
and things that go into the bug.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.640
How often does it occur?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.120
Is there a reasonable workaround?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.240
The list goes on and on and on.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.880
And what I've realized, what being in software and especially

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.240
on the testing side for over 20 years is done for me is I can very quickly

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.760
contextualize any bug.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.620
What's contextualized?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.060
It's a word I just made up for this.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.580
Meaning when I see an error

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.820
or something go wrong, I immediately start looking at how often would it happen?

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.340
What's the impact?

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.300
If this is as bad as they're saying, how come no one else seen it before?

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.860
Let's look a little bit deeper and figure out what else is going on here.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.220
So you evaluate the the risk and the benefit of fixing the bug.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.780
I think the risk of not fixing or not fixing now versus fixing

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.340
later today or tomorrow.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.600
Right. Or making a decision based on the nature of the bug.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:40.040
So what I've noticed is I see just there's the from these cohorts

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.240
who are haven't quite mastered this fact.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.750
They see the error, the bug, they have a moment of panic.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.800
And when they declare that the whole thing is FUBAR and I stop.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.480
And sometimes I know they're getting better at it.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.200
I just stop it and I'll just go, what do you think, Alan?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.830
And I don't say anything.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.900
And they go, let me look at this again, look at it again.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.100
OK, so it really it's kind of if you look at it in a way by design

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.300
and it's it's probably wrong.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.980
We should look at it and there immediately as we have a

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.340
a moment together about it, they can take a moment to realize

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.300
that it's not that big of an issue or maybe in some cases it is that big of an issue.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.460
They may see something that the opposite can happen occasionally.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.940
They go, well, that just happens.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.510
Hold on a second.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.590
This is Alan Page, software psychologist.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.710
That the I was going to go for the bug whisperer.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:48.830
But it's an interesting almost human behavior observation exercise.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.150
Fun to watch how people react to bugs in software.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.070
Why do you think you were reacting that way?

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:03.190
Oh, very good, because there's always motivation behind the way people act.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.870
One, I think there's a new responsibility

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.230
they haven't had before to actually care about these bugs and to make decisions

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.270
based on them, so they're maybe taking it a little bit too.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.630
I want to say too seriously, but there's a lot of pressure

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.830
to make sure they make right decisions based on quality.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.310
People are trying to understand that they own quality and this stuff's important.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.750
So that stuff drives it.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.190
They don't want to make the wrong decision, but in some cases,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:37.070
they're so worried about making the wrong decision that they get paralyzed.

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.990
In fact, one of them said to me, one of my colleagues said the other day,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.870
it's the worst thing we can do is to is to ask the team to dog food

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.710
this product too early.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.830
And I said, no, the worst thing we can do is actually sit on this

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.190
and never ever have anybody look at it besides us.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:02.510
Yeah, so so it's it's context and it's weird because I'm the test.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.950
I'm supposed to be the guy.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.470
I'm you know, traditionally the tester is the you know,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.710
I don't want to be the gatekeeper.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.790
I don't want to be that guy.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.510
We know what happens.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.710
You see my slide on what happens when you're the guy

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.810
at the end of the product cycle.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.290
We actually podcast this early on.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:28.260
And so one of your prior adventures in your career,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:35.440
you I recall you went and interviewed your manager's peers.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.310
Pretty sure this is when you were starting in your very last team.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:46.190
And one of the guys said the goal of QA is to sign off and that upset you greatly.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.510
Oh, that was an Xbox.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:53.640
Yeah, we had no longer employed director of development for Xbox.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.640
He was talking about roles.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.920
And I explained to I thought testing and fit in back home.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.680
And testing.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.200
Yeah.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.680
And he said, no, no.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.400
The goal of test is to sign off.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400
Yeah.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.280
And the guy was a couple levels above me.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.440
And I didn't want to burn any bridges.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.200
But the thought you can imagine the thoughts going through my head

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.600
of what I wanted to say.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.960
The thoughts going through my head is imagine the payroll money

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.080
that Microsoft saved.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.610
Now, winding back to your last story, so far my favorite part of your story

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.740
is what you haven't mentioned, which is.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.780
Is that I'm not wearing any pants right now?

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.140
No.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.660
Something else.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.660
I was working through a segue to bring that up.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.100
All right, great.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.140
I guess that will work.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:50.980
No, is the infamous question that was always asked to test

00:10:50.980 --> 00:11:02.870
in this sort of situation, which is why wasn't this found before?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.590
Did that not get brought up?

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.350
No.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.670
It almost seems non sequitur in this case.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.950
We have bugs.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.110
And my team now, I don't know if I told you this.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.080
That's fantastic, by the way.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.010
My team, bless their little hearts after all my work,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.850
we talked about this.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.790
We now fix bugs as we go.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.950
So you're down to zero bugs?

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:37.390
We still have some previous debt that is being actively beaten down.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.190
But the goal is to hover at zero.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.550
So your rallying cry is working.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.310
I don't know how, but yeah.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.860
I think it's the threat of shipping.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.540
Well done.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.780
You deserve a self pat on the back.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.370
Golf clap.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.210
All right.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.690
All right, so I forgot where we were.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.210
Anyway, interesting observation.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.810
Wanted to bring it up.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.210
I'm still not clear on.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.610
So I'm guessing it's somewhere in FUD.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.870
But do you think it's something new that's causing the panic,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.030
or do you think it's just sort of tradition?

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.630
So no, a little bit of tradition.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.790
But I think more, we have a product and probably

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.110
some context.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.310
So you're going to made up that work contextualized earlier

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.790
around bugs.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.910
Context would be good.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.790
So we have, I mentioned our product a little bit of a reset.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.130
We're not officially announced.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.950
I won't talk about what it is and what those deals are.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.470
But we changed our back end infrastructure.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.710
So we're slowly getting our site that we had running pretty

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.350
well back in November, up and running.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.950
It's actually running very well.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.150
But we have a pretty aggressive ship schedule

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:52.140
to start bringing some other teams on later this month,

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.340
to bring on some external teams and larger parts of Microsoft

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.020
through the rest of the spring, and then

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.900
to have public preview, mass availability in June.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:09.060
So it's a very aggressive ship schedule, which on one hand,

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.620
the art of shipping is so fun.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.940
And in my role, I play part tester, part shipper,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.060
which are two weirdly opposite hats

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.180
to wear in the traditional world.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.140
So I put on this one hat that says,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.260
we've got to fix this stuff before we can go forward.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.540
But we have enough people already paranoid about that.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.940
So more often than not, I have to wear the ship hat, which

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.460
says, let's get crap out there so we can get some feedback

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:31.960
on it.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.540
Let's go fast.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.740
As fast as we can, let's be aggressive about getting out

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.260
to more people and making sure we have the tools in place

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.620
to learn from their experiences.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.260
Because if we don't do that, we're

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.380
not going to make the rest of our goals.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.100
I've noticed a similar phenomenon myself.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.700
As I went through the transition,

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:06.220
detestifying the way I looked at problems.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.180
And I have now found that it's very common for me

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.940
to take the opposite view I did 15 years ago.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.140
No, you can't ship that.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.380
I don't want even customers even coming

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.180
into the room that's dark and with the software running.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.620
But now I'm just like, no.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.700
Getting customers inside.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.020
You and I have advanced down that path a little bit.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.140
And a lot of our peers haven't.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.180
So I think you saw where my story was going,

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.060
but I'll finish it for the three,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.780
is that there's a lot of paranoia over,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.620
we can't go to these people if there are errors in our product.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.300
I'm thinking, go to the people.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.580
They'll tell you what the errors are.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.620
We'll fix them because we're set up to do that.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.100
And then we need to get the other feedback.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.060
The only time that I am right now,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.550
the only time I'm in agreement with, let's say,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.110
your peers' point of view, is when

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.350
we don't have the process and infrastructure in place

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.510
to quickly react.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.870
If we're going to ship a bug and it is super painful,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.790
and we don't know, let's say we don't know the bug.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.830
This is where I'd become.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.830
Oh, yeah.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.190
We don't know if we're about to ship something.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.070
If we don't have the ability to turn something around

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.070
within a week, then I'm concerned.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.070
No, that makes sense.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.670
And also, if you have any sort of, we don't know why.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.860
But every once in a while, the whole site goes down.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.820
We're not sure why.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.940
I think you want understood issues.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.060
You still want to keep a tight ship.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.900
I don't think you can do, if we still

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:49.770
had hundreds of known issues, it's a little more difficult

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.460
to say, OK, here you 1,000 people go use this,

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.380
because you know there's 100 issues

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.740
and so they're going to run into.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.100
And I'd rather have them have a small number of issues

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.820
or some issues that we didn't know about.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.660
Anyway, horse is dead and beaten.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.680
Speaking of traditions and things.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.560
There was this product that Microsoft bought called Yammer

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.360
that is actually occasionally used to Microsoft.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.120
You've heard of it, Brent?

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.600
I have.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.120
I use it.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.640
Did your team still use Yammer for reports and things?

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.480
I've changed teams.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.280
So Mike, I did bring it into my team.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.680
And I'm pretty sure my last team has abandoned usage.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.400
Yeah, as far as I can tell, and this is,

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.960
I don't spend a lot of time on Yammer,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.920
but the primary usage scenario of Yammer by Microsoft

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.070
employees is to complain about stuff.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.230
So my current use of Yammer, we've

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:54.830
pulled together a branding site for the output of my team.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.350
And when you go to this site, the very first page

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:03.120
launches into an embedded Yammer page.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.160
So the first thing people see is the communication

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.240
we have up on Yammer.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:07.920
Interesting.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.520
Yeah.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.640
Well, a colleague pointed me to a thread on Yammer,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.730
which I took part in.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:20.060
But it was, I don't know the context of how it came up.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.020
But someone said, the basic gist was, and I won't read it.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.740
I'll paraphrase it.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.380
It said, can we please have our testers back?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.630
No.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.750
And the gist was, well, there was a couple

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.590
of really fundamental flaws.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:42.550
As you know, Microsoft, we don't have any anymore, even Estet's,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.550
which does not mean you idiot.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.870
I'm sorry, the three-year smart.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.270
But when your friends hear that Microsoft

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.110
doesn't have any testers, that does not

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.750
mean we don't do any testing.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.310
We do plenty of testing.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.750
In fact, in some cases, we may do more testing

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.630
than we did before.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.030
Not true across all products.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.270
Some people have not made.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.670
We've talked about the transition

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.030
to unified engineering.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.520
Some teams have not made that transition as well as others.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.120
Blah, blah, blah, covered that.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.680
But here's the point.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.760
Here's while maybe I'll rant a little bit.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.540
Here's the soapbox.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.820
All right.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.380
If you want your testers back, because you're a lazy developer

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.540
and you can't make your code work on your own

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.500
and you need the safety net of a tester

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.060
to make sure that you feel good about your code,

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.100
then quit.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.100
Don't even wait to get fired.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.570
Just either get yourself fired now, HR violations.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.410
I have a list of them.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.690
I can give them to you.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.050
The probably fireable fences.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.610
I don't care what they are.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.450
Just quit.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.210
Leave.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.010
I don't want you here.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.770
I don't want you in the software industry.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.730
Go do something else.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.570
Go sell.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.210
Real estate.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.770
Real estate's on the rise again.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.330
Go sell real estate, Brent says.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.050
Yeah, I can, sure.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.250
Just something else.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.810
Don't go looking for your safety net.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.210
And you think, well, I'll quit and go to some other company.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:01.930
Guess what?

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.010
Unless you go into some IT shop in Podunk, Iowa,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.410
making $11 an hour, you are not going to get a tester

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.050
to test your crap.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.260
Oh, wait a minute.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.740
If we could send them to one of our competitors.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.260
Oh, yeah.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.020
Oh, actually, for your style, I hear

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.940
Google is a great place to work.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.300
You should really consider it.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.230
Yeah.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.230
And they'll say, well, Google has testers.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.030
It's different.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:27.950
There you go.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.510
Go there.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.310
You'll thrive.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.670
But then there's another reason.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.790
So now, I don't want the safety net.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.990
It's because our products are low quality.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.070
Oh, so you need someone to beat quality into the product,

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.630
because that's the job of the tester.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:48.900
This idea that testing is where quality comes from is,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.940
it doesn't make any sense.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.860
How can it make sense to anyone in software?

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.580
If we would test this, we would have higher quality.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.900
There was something that you said

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.020
on when we were talking about the prior topic.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.660
I decided not to bring it up, but I'm going to now.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.580
And you said a statement which says,

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.060
not all bugs are created equal.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.780
And it was clear that you were referring

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.410
to evaluating the impact.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.130
But it got me thinking, no, he's right.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.570
Not all bugs are created equal.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:23.790
And I'm like, OK, so how is test impacting that?

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.550
How did test ever impact that?

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.470
Never did.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.230
Never did.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:34.070
Look, Dev douchebag, if you want to bring back testers,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.190
first try figuring out what's happening,

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.950
such that you're creating the stupid bugs in the first place.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.190
Right.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:47.150
This whole rant is, there's a side rant coming up.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.710
I was talking about testers and quality.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.480
And they're just not related.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.200
Well, not directly related.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.200
Of course, if you test things, you're

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.720
going to have higher quality.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.800
Maybe, if you're lucky.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.280
Yeah.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.680
Bugs released in the wild are not

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.060
because of a tester failure, because they didn't have

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:05.560
testers.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.320
And there are douchebags on Twitter.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.310
Did I say, did we just go up to PG?

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.950
I hate this.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.910
I'm pretty sure where I've always been PG.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.550
Maybe people who, there are people

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.750
who make their money on the fact that they need testers.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.630
So this idea there are no testers freaks them out.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.460
And then every time there's a bug,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.920
a press release of a bug, they act like they're

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.480
going to be like, this wouldn't have happened

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.120
if that team had a tester.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.760
Right, exactly.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.920
It goes right back to this, can you

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.680
look at this bug in context?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.960
And they would have found this bug if they had a tester.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.360
They wouldn't have released this.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.520
And it's like, they're just a bunch of BS.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.240
I just don't get people.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.280
I am, the longer, and I've said this before, and the three,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.280
I do not mean to offend any of you.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.920
But the longer I work as an engineer in this new world,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.640
the less and less I relate with software testing

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.800
that I see in Twitter and the BloggerSphere, et cetera.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.790
Same here.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:16.270
So you know, my blog site is Testastic,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.890
which I love it as a brand name.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.570
But I'm just like, every time I go in and I want to post

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.730
and write it up, I have test in your name.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.570
And I'm just like, ugh.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.210
I so, and I can feel every time I notice that,

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:38.690
I just so, that a big chunk of my self-identification

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.050
with that brand is just lost.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.890
I just, I don't feel it.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.570
And I still consider myself a test specialist.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.730
There are test, people in the test world

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.930
who wouldn't consider what I do testing, and I don't care.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.160
But I'm a specialist in test and quality.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.520
I'm respected for that, and I get paid for that.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.120
So that's what I do.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.120
But I can't relate to discussions on automation and,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.080
and it's ridiculous.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.930
I am still quite passionate around quality

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.970
and how to get there.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:28.120
I no longer have the passion around preventing impact

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.160
to quality.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.080
My passion is much more around how

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.720
do I minimize the total impact of quality.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.080
So the model used to be, oh, we must prevent it at all costs.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.240
No.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.880
No, if it's cheaper, faster, better, cooler to react to it

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.400
and that reduces the overall pain,

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.720
that's a better strategy.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:57.110
I'm done with the month-long test passes before we ship.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:06.290
Yeah, bringing back testers, it almost, to me,

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.890
hopefully like in the next five years, if a dev says that.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:16.090
So let me put a cap on that, because then we'll go on.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:21.090
My role, I am on this 120-person team,

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:25.810
whatever big we are, as the test guy, the quality guy.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.290
But I'm not the, and I think having that role,

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.930
having a quality specialist, a test specialist on a team,

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.210
I think is good.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.130
But I don't do really any testing.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.290
Your role is that?

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.730
I'm making sure the right things are happening,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:44.040
but I'm not your tester.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.280
You're a knowledge coach.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.560
Your role is to scale the testing skill set

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.200
within your org.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.240
And I think, actually, even with that size,

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.400
if you were to have more of you in that team,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.960
maybe two or three of people like you would be fine.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.600
But much more than that, you start

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.880
to feel and look like a safety net that people would go after.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.360
Right.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.240
The one thing, too, that I always find interesting,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.280
you know how we previously talked about people go,

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.280
well, if they had a tester, blah, blah, blah,

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.690
this would have been found, and this would never have shipped.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.330
Hey, guys, particularly to those folks

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:39.890
who are generally consultants who get paid to rile up testers

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.490
and send them new projects, I don't

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.690
know if you're aware of this, but I

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.370
know hordes of testers who have found that bug

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:58.360
and had the decision to ship taken from their control.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.600
So no, that's wrong.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.400
Your prevailing assumption that somebody

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.910
didn't know about this before it shipped

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.070
is not guaranteed.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.390
Yeah, and often, I hate, I want to end this subject,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.230
but there's context.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.910
Often, you may see this bug is horrible.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.270
How could they know about this?

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.830
And sometimes you knew about it,

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.430
but you didn't realize, you're talking about contextualization.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.350
You didn't realize the impact of the bug.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.150
Like, oh, this is bad, but it looks

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.950
like it only happens in this situation,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.070
but it turns out it happens in a wider situation

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.950
or something like that.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.230
Yeah, it only happens at midnight on February 29,

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.120
and only if it's on a Wednesday.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.800
Oh, wait, no, it happens all the time.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.600
Whatever.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.520
Hey, we, thank you, three, one of the three sent us

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.240
a letter, an email, not a real letter.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.760
I haven't got a letter in a long time.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.250
I get cards at Christmas, but we got an email.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.130
It must be nice still having friends.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.850
And you know what happens when, well,

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.810
if you're not obnoxious and ugly, you get friends.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:08.650
Or one of the two.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.590
Yeah.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.030
You learned to live with it.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.110
When one of the three sends us an email

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.830
and asks us a question, you know what that means, Brent?

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.270
I do, but why don't you share?

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.110
Mailbag!

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.960
Woo hoo!

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.840
Love these things.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.700
Christopher Rod from Microsoft.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.540
One of the three emailed us and asked us.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.300
I'll skip all the stuff that says,

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:44.300
Brent, you smell bad even over the podcast, which is weird.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.920
But anyway, anyways, I have a question for your mailbag.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.640
Can you guys talk about your experiences

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.640
and process you guys go through

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.000
when doing planning and decomposition

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.880
for sprints or semesters?

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.160
I'm assuming you're involved in those types of meetings.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.390
Yes.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.110
How are requirements gathered, blah, blah, blah.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.510
In the past, I've experienced horrible requirements

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.990
with one-liner storage scenarios,

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.430
the infamous we're agile,

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.710
we don't have documentation excuses came up,

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:12.750
blah, blah, blah.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.970
So I spend a lot of time helping teams

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.770
groom their backlog and get things in order

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.970
and watch their crazy attempts at estimation.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.800
So I can add some color too,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.880
but you've done more of this, Brent,

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.520
so I'm gonna let you start.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.300
Oh, I'm reeling on the agile equals no documentation,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.780
but I'm going to do my best to ignore this.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.540
It's okay, the three no.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.980
Yeah, that's true.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.380
All right, so.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.420
Anytime now.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.320
Where to begin?

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.800
So I'll just say at a high level,

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.340
what my team does is we want to,

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.000
so semesters at Microsoft, I'm gonna start here.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Semesters at Microsoft generally mean six-month chunks.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.560
I have a question for you because

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.800
I haven't used semesters before, is that,

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.400
and I just could be an ignorant part of my Agilish,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400
is that a Microsoft thing

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.040
or is that really an Agil thing used?

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.360
No, it's a Microsoft thing.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.960
Good to bring up, okay, thank you.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.240
I ignore Microsoft-only terms,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.980
so I'm happy about that one.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.420
So the model that I am now most using,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.450
there is essentially three models that I'm familiar with.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:49.330
There's the Kanban model, there's the Scrum model,

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.770
and then there's the SAFE model.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.650
My favorite one is the SAFE model.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.800
Really?

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.640
Yeah.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.480
Really?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.320
Really.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.840
So elaborate, sorry, I'll shut up.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.960
Why does that shock you?

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.000
Are you familiar with it?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.240
I'm familiar with SAFE.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.680
The SAFE planning model?

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.520
Yeah.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.460
Okay.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.680
So when you're planning,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.480
there's a couple of considerations.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.590
In an Agil world, right, you want to,

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.020
Alan and I have mentioned this over and over again,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.220
you want to create a planning model

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:34.670
and a planning cadence that's adaptable,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.390
not predictable.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.770
Right?

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:40.610
Yes.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.450
Yes.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.130
Now, there's another aspect to this

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.330
that we haven't talked here,

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.900
which falls into what I see occurring

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.540
when people start the conversation around

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.420
we don't do documentation.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.620
Okay, because in addition to,

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.260
you don't want a prediction-based model,

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.840
you also don't want an interruption-based model.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.440
And loose documentation, no documentation,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.090
encourages interrupt-driven processes

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.650
under the name of agility.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:32.190
So what my team does,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.750
oh, I'm gonna go three more principles.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.430
Okay, number one, in order to adapt,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:44.870
that means you need to continuously groom your backlog

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.190
and be able to update it with the latest available knowledge.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.720
For execution purposes, you want to have a model

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.520
that gives the team a longer-term roadmap

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.680
but creates the most amount of knowledge

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.680
towards the short-term tactical bits.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.920
So to be more specific,

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.480
Microsoft generally plans at a,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.280
not Microsoft, I don't think it's all Microsoft,

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.520
but certainly my division uses six-month chunks.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.060
It's kind of a, more of a predictive model

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.820
where executives ask us,

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.300
hey, what are you going to do?

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:34.300
Okay, and honestly, what I do is I produce that and say,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.860
hey, here's the direction I'm doing

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.260
and here's what I think is happening.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.220
By the way, just to be super clear,

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.700
as I discover new knowledge, I will adapt

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.500
and I'll certainly set expectations,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.140
clarify when I'm doing this,

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.620
but you should expect that changes will occur.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.940
And all executives I've ever presented do just go,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.340
well, of course, that's what you'll do, okay?

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.140
And then I wanna have a planning cycle

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.890
such that I'm producing the highest ROI first.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.410
Okay, that's the principles that I operate under.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.540
To build a roadmap, that's essentially,

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.670
I'm going to book out three months of effort, okay?

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:28.250
And the way I book it out is a month,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.770
I'll take each month, split it into two chunks,

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.010
roughly aligned to two week sprints.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.410
I really just, I don't really care.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.610
I don't use a sprint model when I execute,

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.650
so I just split the month in half.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.580
Whether or not it's actually two weeks, don't really care.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.560
And then for the first month,

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.270
I will book work at 80% capacity,

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.670
second month at 60% capacity,

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.110
and the third month at 40% capacity.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.990
Book those three months in advance?

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.160
Yes.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.000
Interesting.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.240
And so then the numbers may,

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.930
if you're gonna do three months in advance,

00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:09.930
that makes sense,

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.170
because you have this care of overflow,

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.330
it takes care of discover to work,

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.570
which you're always gonna have.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.410
That's interesting.

00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:18.730
I don't like booking three months in advance.

00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:23.090
But I, and again, understanding that you're not,

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.330
based on what you just said,

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.290
you're going to adapt and add and prioritize, et cetera.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.610
So anytime you're doing, for me,

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.730
anything longer than, even a month is hard,

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.410
but the farther out you get, the less accurate it is.

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:40.120
And the more adaptability buffer, I'll call it, you need.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.640
So I like, that's kind of an interesting way

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.760
to do an 80, 60, 40.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.600
Right.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.600
So you correctly identified why you do the 80, 60, 40.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.720
The other thing is,

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.320
why do I book it out three months?

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.320
It's, book is how I communicate it to others.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.960
Okay.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.680
The primary reason why I'm laying out

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.760
a three month roadmap in that fashion,

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.280
is so that my team understands

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.920
sort of the quote unquote, long-term vision.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.400
And the point of laying it out for three months

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.440
is that they can start their work for month number one,

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.280
knowing full well sort of the work

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.880
that we're gonna be doing in month number three.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.360
And so if the work they're doing in month number one

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.680
could be influenced by that long-term work,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.360
they know that beforehand.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.200
All right.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.560
So it's sort of a balance between strategic and tactical.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.720
All right, so when you get to month number two,

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.880
do you, does that become the new month number one

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.040
for the next three months?

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:55.880
Do they overlap?

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.280
That's exactly what happens.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.640
So the week before month number two.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.880
Sorry, I keep on stealing all your punches.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.000
Yes, the week before month number two,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.200
we rebuild the plan, right?

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:11.160
Because month number one, I needed 80%.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.720
Month number two, I needed 60%.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.960
If I executed on month number one perfectly

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.520
and I were just to move the month forward,

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.520
then I got 20 additional percent of capacity

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.280
that I need to fill out.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.120
So I have a question for you.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.000
So how did you come up with the 80% number?

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.880
That's 80% capacity, right?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.120
So what you mean by that is you look at capacity

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:41.000
for the team, then you schedule based on 80% of that.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.840
Is that correct?

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.760
Yes, so there's two cadences that we do

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.360
in terms of backlog planning, okay?

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.080
Number one, the roadmap building

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.940
that occurs once a month.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.220
There's also a weekly backlog meeting, okay?

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.620
So we want to be able to continuously adapt

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.060
to current information, okay?

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.160
One of the single, in my view,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.280
one of the single most important principles

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.920
to the ability to adapt and keep a sustainable pace

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.340
is you must have free capacity.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:18.340
So 80% is not a buffer, which is often,

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.820
is what is considered in the old school world.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:29.100
It's not sort of a, I'm sorry, it's not a buffer,

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.900
it is a buffer for sure.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.900
It's not a buffer of, hey, my team sucks at planning,

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.490
therefore I'm gonna add a buffer.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.330
It's not that.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.530
Its whole purpose in life is unbooked time.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.070
As I go through capacity planning, like for example,

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.550
if you were to go to my,

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:50.670
I don't think I've erased it yet,

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.150
if you were to go upstairs to my office right now,

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:57.310
you would see that I have the three months segmented,

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.230
or bifurcated, so I have six segments.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.870
And one of the things I do is I then say, okay,

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:07.710
so roughly two weeks at 80% means

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.550
eight days available per person.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.510
How many people will I have this time period?

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.950
I then say, okay, I write, say, number 24,

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.230
if I had three people.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.630
Then I ask them, hey,

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.930
who's taking time off during this time?

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:24.490
That gets subtracted.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:28.370
Then what we do is we look at,

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:32.950
there is a pre-planning process,

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.910
which is around what are the scenarios

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.830
that have been asked of us.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.690
I go through an ROI process to determine

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.930
which of these things I should prioritize.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.530
I do not use just a single stack ranking model.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:56.530
I use what's known as WSJF as a model.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.610
I find that extremely effective to rank these scenarios.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.490
Then what we do as a team is we take this scenario,

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.330
even if it's ambiguous.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.930
I bring my whole team in a room,

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.770
we look at the first scenario and say,

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:16.920
okay, what do we need to do to achieve this outcome?

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.660
And then we start discussing what the tasks are,

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.180
and well, I'll have a bunch of sticky notes.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.680
I'll write down the task as it's mentioned,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.440
put it on the board, book it in one of the months,

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.020
and say, how much is this gonna cost us?

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.860
And we-

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.620
And you book by our T-shirt size?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:41.240
No, I go, I use Fibonacci numbers

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.200
and I estimate in days.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.080
Okay.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.160
Okay, so if it's really huge,

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.600
and we only use Fibonacci numbers for this

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.600
because history has shown that as things get bigger,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.480
the more likely you don't have a clue how much-

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.320
Absolutely.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.240
So do you have a limit on how long a work item can be?

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.240
I will only allow Fibonacci number up to 21.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.360
Days?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.680
Up to, listen, I'm not done.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.540
So when we're going through the initial planning,

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.720
I will only allow it up to 21, okay?

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.800
But anything 13 or over,

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.840
when we've identified that it's a 13 or a 21,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.180
it gets broken down.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.420
Okay, so let me just give you,

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.980
I have a lighter weight approach we use on our team,

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.300
which is both good and bad, I think.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.540
We also came up with the 80% number, seemed about right.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.680
We're gonna do 75, but it seemed,

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.460
again, we're gonna experiment with it.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.500
I like the idea of sort of booking things.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.180
We have stuff on the horizon,

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.900
but it hasn't been estimated or costed at all.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.260
So I don't know if it's gonna end up a 60 or not.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.380
And again, based on our ship schedule,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.020
which we talked about before,

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.820
we don't have a ton of time anyway to add a bunch of stuff.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.100
So that's all the same.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.250
We don't use Fibonacci.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:10.250
We do make sure teams break down any items that are,

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.290
I'm a big fan of the two-day limit for a task.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:20.240
I think even beyond two is when the odds

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.440
of your estimate being correct start declining rapidly.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.240
But I don't make and break down things

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.800
unless they're five days or more.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.840
The thing is for me is I don't prioritize very highly

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.120
that estimates are correct.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.320
No, no, and that's true as well.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.800
So we do it, you have to,

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.200
there's the predictable part where you want to figure out

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.520
how much work can we get done during this iteration

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.200
where you have to use the estimations and capacity

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.400
as a model, remember, all models are wrong,

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.480
some are useful, as a model for figuring out capacity.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.140
Our team is, and I don't think this is a bad thing,

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.820
and this is where a lot of teams

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.180
get themselves in trouble.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.700
Our team is particularly horrible at estimates,

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.580
but that just means we haven't learned a lot about them yet.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.190
Or you haven't learned how to function

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:16.910
without requiring estimates.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.470
Yes, correct, either one.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.630
There is an amount of predictability

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.790
that executive leadership usually wants

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.310
around those estimates, knowing when things can come in.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.110
And when you're working on a complicated product

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.710
where there are dependencies from team to team,

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:36.710
being able to estimate to some level of accuracy

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:40.310
when a dependent feature is going to be available

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.470
is important.

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.820
I want to clarify that very strongly

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.060
because that's another reason why I do the three-month

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.460
and I have the, we'll call the adaptation buffer

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.500
while it scales down.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.780
If the direction doesn't change month over month,

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.300
then I'm able to publish a committed plan,

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.060
something that my team will commit to

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.980
if you add up all the numbers,

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.140
I'm basically taking one third of my team's capacity

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:19.020
off the table by doing this model in the three months.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:25.810
So I'm confidently able to commit to what I laid out.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:32.150
If month over month, if the roadmap changes,

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.430
then the people I'm committing to

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:37.550
are involved in that discussion.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.390
I think you're, I agree completely.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.990
I think I'm talking about different timelines here.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.790
We're talking about dependent features being available

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.430
on a week by week basis

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:50.470
or sometimes even more granular than that.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.630
I actually, so if you have a team

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.670
that has a high degree of dependency,

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.830
then there's another model from SAFE

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:03.230
that I much more prefer, which they call the program board,

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:06.790
which allows, it's,

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.910
you can think of it kind of like a scrum of scrums.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:13.710
It's not, and it's super effective unlike,

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.790
well, that's further proof of why it's not a scrum of scrum.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.450
And then lastly, and I'll close out

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.610
and you can have the final word on this.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.600
As my team is working together

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.520
and we're decomposing these scenarios

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.260
into features and plotting them out, right?

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:40.650
We also write up, hey, what are dependencies?

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.410
We can move, we shuffle tickets around as a result of,

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:49.600
hey, we have to, if there's a natural sequencing, right?

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.260
Or if we need to get people involved, right?

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.580
We go, you know what, we need something from that team.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.020
You know what we're gonna do?

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:04.580
We're not gonna start our portion of this until March,

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.220
but I'm gonna write a ticket in the start of February.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.100
I'll write one ticket for each of these chunks in February

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.980
to say, reach out to that team

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.700
and make sure that they're progressing.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.980
All right, one thing that's nice

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.980
or maybe a little bit different on our team is

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.420
the bulk, we do have dependencies on other

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.590
server products in Microsoft SharePoint, Exchange,

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.310
Skype chat services.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.950
But for the most part, we're self-contained

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.990
and we're all on one, about to be two floors

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:40.550
of Lincoln Square, so a lot of these things

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.910
are just conversations in the hallway versus

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:47.630
you know, more formal tickets, et cetera.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:50.630
But it's, the challenge is, the challenge can be

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:53.230
when you have dependencies, keep everything linked together.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:57.430
One other thing Christopher asked was the role

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.180
of the generalizing specialists or specializing generalists

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.700
and how, if we use those skills in these meetings,

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.700
I want to talk just a little bit about that.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.780
So one thing I do in the, when we're talking

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.260
about estimates of things is just reminding people,

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.060
remember I'm the quality and testing specialist

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:19.060
on the team, is they talk, somebody may be throwing out

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.780
estimates or something, it's about a day.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.180
And I think, and I stop and I give them a look

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.980
and they go, and they'll look at me and they'll say,

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.540
Alan doesn't think it's a day,

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.020
but it's really pretty trivial.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.980
I said, there's a world that you came from

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:36.260
which isn't the world you're in now.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.810
So done, completing the work does not mean

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:44.800
it's working as the best I could tell.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.720
It means you've written tests for this,

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.320
not just unit tests, but some integration tests

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.840
to make sure this works.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.160
You have measured code coverage and looked at where

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.640
gaps are, you've looked, you've added the

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.440
instrumentation to this to make sure we can

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.440
monitor how it's working in the field.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.310
It's hooked up, if it's part of a performance scenario,

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:08.590
that's measured and working and can be tracked end to end.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:11.780
There's a whole list of things that goes into done.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.980
And at first, I get answers like this,

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.220
well, that's why we have the buffer, right?

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.740
So no, no, no, no, no.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.180
It's not that kind of buffer,

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.060
like what Brett talked about before.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.980
It's just unscheduled time.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.980
So we need to, when you think about the answer,

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.540
Christopher's question, one value I bring

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.820
is helping someone see holistically what it takes

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.440
for a feature to be done.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.820
We had, and this has happened a couple times in my career,

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.660
once I watched it happen on my team last fall

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.020
and I will not let it happen again,

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:49.340
it was when the feature is done,

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:52.930
or almost done for about three months.

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.380
And I can't handle that.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.140
It's too much.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.540
You need, things need to get done done now.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.700
Done, done, done, done.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.830
One thing, one bit of color I'll add to that

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:14.090
is my definition of done is proof

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.260
that it added customer value.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.420
That's it, right?

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.260
No, no, no.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.700
Until you've tied the dots together

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.860
that shows proof that this has added customer value.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.300
It's not done, go back to the drawing board, re-estimate.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:39.380
Now, in the waterfall world, that's a pain in the ass.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.620
Hey, we only ship once a year

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:48.820
in the more agile world, particularly in services.

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.700
I'm currently helping A-Team

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.300
that does an on-prem product

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:02.460
and they are going to ship monthly.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.220
It has to change somewhat

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.180
how they're gonna view customer validation,

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.320
but they're going to be able to do it.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.940
It's also helpful in terms of failing fast.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.860
Like if you've just produced a feature

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.580
that you find that no customer's using,

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:24.100
you can discover that in two weeks versus one year

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.380
and go, okay, do we not actually understand our model?

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.380
Because we just spent a month testing this feature

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.300
no one's using, right?

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:38.460
For me, it is so much ROI-focused, it's pitiful.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.590
But on the, I, as you know, have gone back to school

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:51.630
and weekly using Christopher's question

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.830
on generalists and specialists.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:55.470
I've learned something interesting

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.390
that I wanted to share with you, Alan.

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:59.110
I can't wait to hear it, Brad.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:07.110
So I'm currently studying business process management.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:11.150
How to optimize processes.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:15.910
It's all about systems thinking and it's fantastic.

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:19.260
As I was reading chapter one,

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.460
they started bringing up the topic

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.100
of generalists and specialists.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.340
And I learned something, yes.

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.500
They mention these things outside of the AB testing podcast?

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.980
Outside of Agile even, yeah.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.740
Whoa. Yeah.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:39.440
And I learned something that I never knew before.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:45.140
They know when management was created.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.340
Do you know when this was?

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.180
No. Do you have a guess?

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.580
No. When was the first manager ever?

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:55.570
I think you'll find this whole thing fascinating.

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:56.610
I don't know.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.250
A long, long, long time ago.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.140
That's what I thought.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.260
No. And thank you.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.140
Cause all the other people I've done this with,

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.140
they answered correctly.

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.260
And I'm like, damn it.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.420
How did your educational system not fail you?

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.500
No.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.740
The first manager was created during the industrial age.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.840
I don't know if I...

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:20.410
Nope. So I'll give you a name.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:23.050
Fellow by the name of Frederick Taylor.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:24.930
Wasn't like a medieval king,

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.090
like the manager of his court?

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.650
He wasn't a manager.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.570
He was a ruler,

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.010
but manager in terms of command and control,

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:35.820
like we're used to today, didn't exist.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.740
The king is the definition of command and control.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.800
I'm going to let you finish,

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.600
but I don't believe the research.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.960
All right, go on.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.440
Fair enough.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.520
Actually not fair enough,

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.960
but I'll send you links later.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.320
Yeah. Just cause it's written on the internet,

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.160
it must be true.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.000
All right, go on.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.170
So the first manager was created

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.210
during the industrial revolution.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:04.410
Now, the reason why is because prior to that,

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.430
things operated by guilds

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.730
where you would have the barber's guild

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.850
or the shoemaker's guild or the baker butcher

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.290
and candlestick maker guilds

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:22.290
where they would work as a community

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.170
and they would very deeply understand

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:31.410
that whole process of barbarism,

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:38.280
but not really understand how things got to them.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.480
Now, the guild model,

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:46.930
you can view it as sort of a generalizing specialist model.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.490
When the industrial age hit,

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:54.170
but there was no sort of manager of barbers.

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:57.410
They worked together to determine

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:00.840
what would set the standard.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.670
When the industrial age happened,

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:07.130
Ford came in, the assembly line came in,

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:12.130
and that's actually when specialists got constructed,

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:15.870
at least to the degree that we're familiar with it today.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.760
This guy, Frederick Taylor,

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.870
lived 1856 to 1915,

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.950
created this topic called scientific management.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.870
And his purpose in life was,

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.750
given this assembly line model,

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:35.590
how do we increase productivity?

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:39.310
And what they discovered is that

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.340
generalists in that model completely sucked.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:48.820
That the ability for,

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.740
since the work was highly repetitive,

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.540
that it was much more productive

00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:00.060
to have a single individual do that repetitive task

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.380
over and over and over again,

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.100
and then have chains of single individuals

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.140
doing their own different repetitive tasks.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:14.430
Now, they could also optimize a way,

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:15.790
so the dependencies.

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.490
So if you were imagining you and I

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:19.270
were working on the assembly line,

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:23.470
your job was to take a doodad and put a bolt through it,

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:25.030
and then I came after you,

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:28.350
and my job was to put the nut on this bolt.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.740
We could put a wall between the two of us,

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:35.100
I can still succeed.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.980
Okay, here comes a doodad with a bolt through it.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.500
Here's a nut, screw, screw, screw.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:46.500
Highly repetitive specialists in that model.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:53.600
Now, this is where managers came from,

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.480
because now when you over specialize,

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.660
these guys don't need to talk to each other,

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.460
and if you change the order in which things are done,

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.340
it goes out of control.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:10.740
So you needed to have a manager who's controlling

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.700
who's doing what, when, and how.

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.770
And as that boosted productivity,

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.620
management became a science.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.700
How to command and control,

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.320
things like even probably business process management

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.120
came into fruition.

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:37.240
Now, fast forward, thank goodness,

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.240
fast forward to the 80s.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.080
Oh.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.520
All right, so what happened then,

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:49.520
as they learned that this was creating efficiencies,

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:54.640
they began to construct the functional model,

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.640
where the departments would be invoked,

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.760
where departments would self-optimize.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.080
So now we're seeing, okay, we're starting with specialists,

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.600
and they're highly siloed.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.600
They don't need to talk to anybody,

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.960
because their work is highly repetitive,

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.800
and it's the same thing over and over again.

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.640
Then departments got constructed,

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.280
or then managers got constructed, then departments.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.040
And this created a fractal pattern.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.180
And in the 80s, it started to fail,

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.700
because the number of departments,

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.740
much like how specialists were not working well together,

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.020
now departments aren't working well together,

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:38.560
but now they have created such an immense system

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.400
that departments failing to work together

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:46.840
is causing failure, causing critical failure.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.840
I tried to wind this to the software world

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.760
in a generalist and specialist discussion, right?

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.920
And I started thinking through,

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:04.020
in our model, right, what is the place

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:10.750
where work is highly specialized

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.960
in terms of the definition laid out here,

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.720
which is highly repetitive,

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.040
that doesn't require dependencies?

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.920
Yeah, I think in that case, in this particular model,

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:31.160
the metaphor between factory and software

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.840
and knowledge work, it's obvious that it breaks down.

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:39.310
Right, but I have the generalist

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:41.350
versus specialist battle all the time.

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:46.030
Whenever I'm onboarding a new dev team to Agile,

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:49.030
they tell me, but I'm a specialist.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:51.030
And I'm like, okay, what is a specialist?

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:56.030
A specialist is someone with very minimal dependencies

00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:59.760
and repetitive tasks.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.090
And I'm like, I firmly agree

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:07.040
that you view yourself as a specialist,

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:12.040
but the world that you're in doesn't operate that way.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.160
Right.

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.200
Right, and...

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.120
I think what they mean when they say specialist is,

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.640
there's one thing I do really well

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.280
and that's all I wanna do.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.120
Right.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.560
But you still have to adapt to be able to do that,

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.720
and it's not a specialist

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.680
in the terms you've described today,

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:34.680
but within the context of knowledge work,

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.760
they are a specialist.

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.860
And honestly though, I think a pure specialist

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:44.300
and a pure generalist are not paths for success

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.300
in the software industry.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.380
They're not, and I don't even think a...

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:54.030
No, they're absolutely not.

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:58.350
I do think more of the guild model is worked better.

00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:01.430
Right, but once you recognize

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.470
that really the generalist and specialist,

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.710
not only is it, I do something really well

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.550
and that's what I wanna do.

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:09.390
Okay.

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.750
But there's also this idea

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.310
that's generally around the specialist

00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:18.800
and I don't wanna have to play with others.

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.640
Right, there's a siloism that's generally involved.

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.480
Could be.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.340
And what I'm basically stating is,

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.960
in knowledge work and we're in knowledge work,

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.820
if you want to go fast,

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:39.860
if you want to be more productive as a system,

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.580
you need to optimize for the reality,

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.580
which is there are dependencies,

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.580
there is communication required.

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:52.100
And the only way to optimize the whole system

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.100
is essentially to get rid of the specialists.

00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:58.540
You have to convert them to minimum generalizing specialists.

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:03.380
They have to be able to optimize

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.420
and reduce time spent on knowledge transfer.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.500
I agree.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.340
Anyway.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.860
And we should talk about that some more sometime,

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.780
but we are way out of time for today.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.780
Yes.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:18.540
All right, everybody, I am Brent's friend, Alan.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.500
And I'm Brent.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.380
All right, see you next time.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.220
Bye.
