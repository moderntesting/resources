WEBVTT

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.600
Howdy, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we got our names right. You know why?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.750
Why because this is the 20th time we've done this and oh not only is it episode number 20 guess what else?

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.170
What Alan what I'll tell you it's been

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.190
Almost exactly a year since our very first a B testing podcast. Yep

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.270
Our first one was released March 31st and it is beyond that a one week beyond that. Yes

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.390
We are one more high five. Oh

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.400
Okay. All right that that was unplanned for and unprepared for we're good and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.080
Brent was telling me if we would have been super prepared

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.840
We would have done a fancy retrospective on the year, but we're gonna save that for like 25 or some other

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.920
Something down the road when we actually put some prep time into our episode. Yeah, we'll we can continue to tell you guys

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920
Oh, we'll do that next time

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.080
But those who have been paid attention, we don't actually remember what we left over

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.940
Yeah, we don't really have something like a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.120
Long term format it would be wouldn't that be right weird like if we had like this this this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.660
Strategy of what happens and what show and what sets up the thing in the next show and this big long

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.440
Like I'm imagining you know in the police shows

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.920
They have like the pictures and the strings everywhere of the trying to investigate the crime. Yes, we don't have that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.340
We do not we should do that just like random like like books and pictures of people and things and just rent

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.920
Maybe not. No Brent says Brent's giving me the Alan shut up. I I think we would need to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.570
Have a reason. Oh

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.570
Yeah, like the ROI of of of that. Well, it must be good. We have by all signs we have

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.820
a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.620
Still kept our three listeners. Well, yes, and Jim Moore is one of them, you know, Jim Moore I do Jim Moore

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.980
He I've heard he uses something called a poop snorkel

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.620
How does that work I have no idea but he asked me to use the word in the podcast

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.620
So I guess it's one of his favorites

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.240
Okay. All right moving on those who know Jim no one now

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.160
That's not a surprise in any way shape or form. All right, and you can just email him at poop snorkel at Microsoft calm

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.180
Yes. All right moving on past that. I'm a big fan of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.460
Logical fallacies, you know what logical fallacies are Brent

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.050
Actually, my I should it's too early in the morning coffee is not kicking in yet

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.990
Yeah, I had three shots of tequila on the way

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.150
No, I did not I did not and I was going to bring the tequila and as I looked up bleary eyed on a Monday morning

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.510
at

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.950
45 a.m. When I was getting ready to go to work. I thought no

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.110
Not gonna happen. So we're gonna drink coffee shots while we do our 20th episode today

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.670
I'm remembering going back to logical fallacies. I remembering. Oh, yeah, I brought that up to me had a we had a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.150
Mutual friend of ours came in to to tag

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.490
Gosh a long time ago and walked through a presentation. Oh, oh

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.030
That was Jeff Weston Jeff for Weston, right? Yeah, and then

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.270
My son he learned logical fallacies in his

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.390
history class for some reason last year and so he's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.590
He's a big fan of trying to use logical fallacies to win arguments with well

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.550
I think that makes sense because history is a course about learning about the past

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.110
But it's also you learn a lot of critical thinking and logical fallacies. I think line up very well with critical thinking

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.340
Yes, they do. All right

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.180
So anyway logical fallacies are when you and implies history lines up with critical thinking when you use non logical thinking to assume

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.360
I'm gonna this is not the Wikipedia or Wiktionary or whatever definition

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.020
But the easiest way to put it is you think you're using logic, but you're not or you think you have the right answer

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.150
But you're not you're using

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.850
The basis of which you draw your conclusion is not based on actual logic

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.530
What's an example Alan? Let me give you some example. There's what I see all the time in

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.870
especially in testing and software circles in general which can be

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.720
Referred to often as the anecdotal fallacy or more often when I see I like to call the hasty generalization

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.200
And we see this in data all the time this ties over to data quite a bit the hasty generalization

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.600
the hasty generalization is when I get a little bit of data from

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.790
A small sample set and I make a grand generalization about that data. You ever seen that Brent. I have quite a few times

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.590
and it's often

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.230
Very wrong. Although on the other side. I also see the reverse where

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.750
No, no, you we can't trust the data until we have a hundred percent

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.290
calculation of all the data

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.370
because because you may not be

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.170
Counting the the extremes that sort of aligns with my point. Yeah, there's probably a name for that

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.870
I'll spur the moment. I'm gonna call that the inappropriate completeness fallacy. Sure. Sure

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.390
I just made that name up somebody writing incorrect to me. So now now I got a theme. I there's a couple of them

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.920
That I'll share with you and I've actually had

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.580
High level people shared these with me in a serious conversation. Hey, Brent. Yeah

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.620
You know, I never actually got to an example of a hasty generalization. No, I talked about what sorry

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.180
So I'm gonna like I'm gonna I'm gonna let you finish

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.780
I'll finish after you I asked you for Beyonce had a great album last year

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.140
Okay

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:57.640
So brand two has no clue at all about pop culture. I miss that. I actively avoid it. All right, Taylor. Let's go on though

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.940
Are you gonna shake it off? Is that what you're saying? I'm gonna shake something

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.630
So what's your example? So what I see all the time is

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.130
I'll do one from like ten years ago at Microsoft actually. I'll do one from this weekend

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.520
Someone who was a tester former tester at Microsoft all of his friends were testers of Microsoft

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.520
Made a generalization that Microsoft laid off all their testers last summer to which

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.920
He was informed that no actually they laid off

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.760
Yeah, some testers got laid off

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.040
But actually every discipline every role from HR to marketing to finance to engineering were affected

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.120
Said well all my friends that got laid off for testers

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.300
Nice tasty generalizations. Yep a good example happens a lot with I talked to someone a few years ago. He said that

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.040
Some weird assumption about managers at Microsoft. Well, he said I forget what it was I

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.000
Said why would you think that it says well, I I have a friend who's a manager at Microsoft and he told me

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.200
So that's a and that really falls in the anecdotal fallacy. Maybe it's or it's one data point

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.680
I guess it's I don't know which I don't know where to draw the line between the two that that last one

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.440
I've encountered quite a bit. One of the things well as a manager at Microsoft

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:20.640
But a lot of times the the pattern I discovered is that the people who are sharing this

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.560
Are often in Microsoft and had been on their team

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.160
for say the last 10 years or so and they operate on the assumption that

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.080
How their team functions is actually how all of my oh, that's a very good one, too

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:43.720
Right. I I actually have a habit and I can you do as well kind of changing jobs every every two to four years

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.160
So in my career here, I don't even know how many different groups I've been on and I've noticed no different teams

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.200
Have very distant. Absolutely. Absolutely. I didn't watch got into a point now as as we talked

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.000
I'm on a new team and one of the first things that I'm doing is I'm trying to figure out

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.390
What is the culture of this team?

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:13.580
Like certain things like okay, how are they gonna do the review process because that changes team by team?

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:19.520
How how are they gonna decide the goals the the other one is which discipline is dominant?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:27.800
Generally, it's either the dev discipline or the PM discipline that kind of rules that organization

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.830
I don't know which one of those it is yet. I

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.320
Agree completely that there are every team at Microsoft does things differently and

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.920
By talking to one team about what they do making a general vision about Microsoft is pretty far-fetched and that's

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.880
It seems I'm a very logical person. I'd like to think sometimes

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.440
but it just seems it pushes my button when someone makes a

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.970
generalization about the company based on one bit of information when it's

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.650
I got us off in the weeds here. I'm sorry. No, no, I like this topic a

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.770
Generalization that's the sort of the wrong granularity

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.770
Right. They're making a generalization. That's sort of

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.760
That's true in a certain context within the company

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.600
Absolutely, but they're broadening it up to the whole company like the the a valid generation generalization for Microsoft is

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.960
We make software

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.960
Yes, that's a valid generalization

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.140
An invalid one all PMs write code

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.960
totally

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.020
Although I've been on teams where PMs did there's a couple of them that I remember when you brought this up

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.840
from the old days

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.240
I'll save the best one for last. I've actually had an argument with

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.210
devs in in the in

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.720
The the the throws of us trying to ship right? It's always that crunch period

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.360
This is back in the the multiple discipline

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:12.560
Phase where there was a test discipline and the dev discipline. Yeah, cuz Microsoft doesn't do testing anymore, right? Not at all

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080
actually, if you read some of our

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.250
the analysis of some recent products

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:26.090
There might be some confirmation of that there may there may be confirmation as well as logical fallacies in there

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.090
Yes, anyway, I've actually had people

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.030
In the heat of a moment actually tell me that if it weren't for test

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.510
There'd be no bugs

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.980
as if to say

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.020
Test is the one that causes the bugs

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.730
Indirectly you could say that but we're the ones but but the statement as itself is true if it weren't for test

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.730
There be no

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.420
bugs

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.220
Filed at least at least no bugs found before a ship, right?

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.220
But my favorite one this was years ago

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:09.410
Where I was on a team who owned the stress and performance and load

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:16.970
We had multiple directors attest. I had one call me that was not in my management chain and

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.920
He had had it with me. He was frustrated. He wanted to call me and get on the same page

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.640
Because he was concerned that I was

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:33.600
Continuing as I as I found holes. I was continuing to add test cases to my stress suite

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.380
Okay

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.380
beyond

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:43.450
The test complete date this was one of the themes in my career that actually had a test

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.650
I've been on a team that had a test complete date. Yes. Yeah, I

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:53.050
Laughed at it at the time said okay, whatever. Well, we'll crawl down the calendar and in he said

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:59.220
And I remember this can't keep testing. I remember this conversation like yesterday

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.140
he called me on the phone and he was trying to be diplomatic and trying to

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:11.980
Convince me to his point of view. He's like bring if you keep adding tests pass the test complete date

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.170
You'll find bugs and that will cause us to

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:23.500
Slip now I want to remind you and our audience that this was one of the directors of test

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.800
The and I said well the logic makes sense. Of course

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.710
Absolutely the the thing I said and I brought out

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:42.070
First off because I didn't report to him. So I wanted to to not dance around the topic. I said look

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.640
My job is to do the best to find bugs before our customers do

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.640
Your job and I didn't say it this bluntly close though

00:12:52.640 --> 00:13:01.000
I said it is the decision of ship room of which you attend not me to decide whether or not the bugs that I file are

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.840
worth

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:09.190
Slipping right. I am enabling you guys to make a decision as to whether or not it's worthwhile to do this risk

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:16.990
Right. I feel like you're calling me saying that you believe that I'm victimizing your team or the product

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.910
When in fact what I am attempting to do is is find critical issues before the customer does

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.550
Because if the customer finds these issues

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:31.230
Our particular product it's four months before you can do a re-release

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.210
So if if I find if I add new test cases, which I'm going to do

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:43.180
I'm going to continue to do even pass we should ship and they file bugs. All right, they find bugs

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.970
It's your call to decide whether or not it's worth holding. Well, this is interesting

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:53.830
I don't know if this is a stick on the logical fallacy topic. I'm not sure if this is a logical fallacy or

00:13:54.470 --> 00:14:00.710
Or what to call this but I still see this sort of thing today in his head

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.870
He's enforcing policy. Right? He said well we have code we have test complete

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:12.630
so we're done testing and you're doing things that are out of policy I had a situation last week where I

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.270
I'm quickly

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:21.570
Moderating in my head, but we had all of our builds break every build fail due to a policy change

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.190
and and the policy was valid but it broke everything and

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.900
I contacted the team that enforced the policy said hey

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.640
We need to find another way to deal with this because your current implementation breaks all of our builds

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:42.040
And they said did you have a heads up on the policy change? We did we did okay, and we didn't actually know

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.120
Break us or not. I said, let's turn it on

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.060
let's let's see if the change breaks us and we'll back it out if not and

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.520
Turned it on it broke. I emailed them. I said hey, we're broken

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.080
Please please revert. They said we can't revert its policy. So wait a minute

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.440
Wait a minute. I didn't take I reiterated the fact we don't have builds

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.820
we have you know, we have a dozen repos for building in all CI and

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.300
All none of them are working. So I want one more emails. Okay, we'll turn them back on

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:24.260
And they're back on us an email and I said hey things are working. Thank you said okay now that we've confirmed that

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:30.940
The policy is in fact the issue. We're going to turn it back off. So no, no, don't do that

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.980
Don't do that, but it's policy and it went on

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.690
It's a little bit like spinal tap our amps go to 11 and the policy is not turned on right now

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.730
We are going to

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.330
Get an exception or a worker. It's our builds are not gonna break

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.730
They finally got through their head those are important, but it's another case where this happened

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:56.490
Almost every team I've I can probably recall dozens of examples of enforcing the policy

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.090
overrides doing the right thing

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:04.450
Yep, and that's kind of what happened in your case and then one other two other stories

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:10.330
that your story and reminded me of is I was on a team once where

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.930
half joking but half serious to

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.240
they

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.400
The director said we should send the testers home

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.470
So we don't find as many bucks. I they were half joking

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.870
But I don't think they're all the way joking and then then my favorite story is see that

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.070
Like what's the policy? Do you think that they're doing? Is it just oh in order to ship?

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.450
I think it'd be bug-free. I don't know. I think they were trying to get to maybe

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.710
Down to a certain bug count they wanted to fix the bug curve

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:46.730
So incoming wasn't as high as fixed rate and I think and they did this is one of those things this yeah and sure

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.730
So I think we're targeting the wrong

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.420
Goal right they do. Yes think and this is for leadership as well as those

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:01.800
Wanting to inform leadership. I think it's important to keep track of the goal you're shooting for

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.340
I was on a team once where the dev team was way behind

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.500
they were writing very poor code and

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.060
They all decided that they were gonna come in their direct side. We're gonna come in on the weekend

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.940
We're gonna we're gonna make some progress here get ourselves under control

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:24.020
And that gray and the developer simple what I mean the test team isn't coming in aren't we if aren't we just one team and?

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.620
Said alright fun

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.380
Test team we're gonna come in. We didn't feel like we were behind

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.140
but we came in and

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:40.080
Damn it if the dev team didn't leave their weekend of work with more bugs, and they started with be careful

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:47.260
But again we wanted the we need a team come around and really what we needed was a culture change

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.460
Mm-hmm, and that wasn't gonna happen over the weekend, but look we dug ourselves a hole and

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:59.500
Getting out of that hole isn't always the easiest thing in the world now in triggering and triggering weekend time

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.730
Right because everyone

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:09.490
Just wants to get done so they can go back home and spend time with their families that the

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.360
Forcing weekend time is a great way to assure

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.800
System thinking does not happen during that period of time absolutely absolutely hey

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.280
I almost want to jump to our fourth topic you said you had another story

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.720
Oh that was both of them one was oh what there were two in there, okay? When you go back and listen to this

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.940
I'll detect the segue yeah, you can you can get this so

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.460
We get this question

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.980
Not I'm not gonna call us a mailbag question

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:49.180
But we do we had a question a few weeks ago on you know what do test specialists do at Microsoft and then a little

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.820
Variation on that I had someone come my office last week and ask me a question

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:58.460
That wasn't the first time. I've heard this question. It's more like wasn't even the second more like the 10th and

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.700
It's gonna lead to a discussion that I'd like you to have with me if you can take that journey with me Brett

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.700
I will do my best

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.960
The story went like this they said I gotta talk

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.280
Said what's up cuz I do a lot of coaching mentoring what I call a test therapy. Well. I'm sorry

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.400
We don't have testers engineering therapy

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.470
He said I really love my job. I love what I love that term

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.540
Engineering therapist no test therapy. Yeah, okay. I haven't I use that before here no

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.760
Oh, it's my it's it should be my full-time job test colleges

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.590
That's no

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.590
It sounds wrong doesn't it yeah?

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.730
so anyway anyway now that I have awkward thoughts in my head I

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.060
Alright he came to my opposite. He's not a combined

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.320
Combined word I hate a unified engineering team an engineering team a team where oh my god

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.320
There are no testers the sky is falling. It's a former tester says I love my job

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:08.160
I love what I'm doing. I work with great people the technology is freakin awesome says it but the work. I'm doing is I'm

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.040
doing a lot of infrastructure work and

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.160
Making sure our inner and outer loop tests our short tests and our long tests are running and kind of making sure everything sticks together

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.400
Which am I head with yep?

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.920
This is the this is the value that the test specialist brings to the team at systems thinking its generalization

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.920
It's making sure the big picture all works together

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:34.440
It's the kind of crap. I love to and he says and my manager very supportive really likes me then I have my skip level

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.880
And he said and my skip level said you know really like the work you're doing

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:50.290
But you don't really have a feature to hang your hat on and Brent made the sound that went off in my head I said well

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:59.750
That's interesting, and I think a big transition teams need to make when they go to a team of

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.950
disciplines to specializing generalists and generalizing specialists is

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.520
That not everyone on the team the counting

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.400
Developer productivity by counting features completed is no longer the right actually never was the right math

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.000
But it cannot be the right math you cannot build in my opinion

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.720
I know I talked about this a quality product when everybody is just a plain old feature developer you

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:33.200
Those people that can be the glue to make everything stick together and define the holes etc the former testers the people with that test

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:40.880
Or system thinking or critical thinking mindset those are the people that are critical in my opinion to your the success of your product

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.450
So it was interesting that and again in this case it falls back to his

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.650
Management chain is very much work item driven development

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.000
Everything your bugs are not even consider. It's very much

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.580
Getting features done is how you're counted and how you're how you're

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.060
valued on the team

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.020
I have a lot of opinions on this but with that set up

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.380
I'll just kind of see where you are Brent if you're still with me Brent's

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.860
Seriously scrolling notes. I am a little posties

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.540
I'm not sure if he can read his writing or if he knows which order he wants to talk about them in

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.300
But Brent I will make it up as usual of course you will so

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.770
This very well aligns

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:33.570
With our theme today. We have a holy wait pause we have a theme it does we do all right go on

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.370
All the go us so we talked about generalizations

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.930
Now we're talking about generalists

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.890
Right and later generally enough

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.730
Um

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.050
Speaking of which

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.860
So you've seen those commercials where they replace the General Lee with like?

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:59.020
Like Corvette or something like that. It's so easy to bring you off target. It totally is

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.620
I just find I can't put my finger on it, but there's something wrong that I just don't like about the new car

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.420
Anyway, okay going on

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.180
So the team I just left

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.060
They're having actually a struggle and one of the struggles there was a

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.020
Non-trivial battle for about a month

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.420
around

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:27.180
So let me wind back a second the team I left just before I left they did emerge they had a

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.220
number of people who have understanding of agile and

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.660
They got another 50% of people who really didn't have an understanding and a good portion of them came from the dev org

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.950
Okay, and what you just called out is this this feature

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.950
idea

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.590
the

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.590
Dev management is trained

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:55.790
That the way you differentiate people is by what features did they build?

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:03.640
And how important were those features or how complex were those features right so the review process in the dev org is

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.080
Sort of in my view a dysfunctional supporting loop for the specialist

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.400
Mm-hmm. We want

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.560
deep

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.560
specialization we want

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.000
Those specializations to continue to be valuable

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.360
right

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.360
In my least favorite one is

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.560
specialists get rewarded for their ability to handle the complexity of

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.000
a particular feature area

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.900
regardless of how it got complex

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:43.100
Right I've been on teams where where a developer was the only guy who understood this code

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.140
And he was the only one who wrote that code for last five years and now it's hacktastic

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:54.260
And he's getting rewarded for over the period of five years of building crap

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.770
You can think of it as it's not really rewarded, but it's sort of

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.860
specialization blackmail I

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:09.120
Got away with job security. No one else knows how this works and no one wants to unwind it

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.510
And no one can there's often a window of opportunity

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:20.990
We we are gonna need seven years to fix all the hacks that you put in over the last five years

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.990
But no one's having that conversation

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:28.190
We've all seen that code my entire career. I've seen that I know that person I know that

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.110
In general that person and I know that code

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:37.490
the difference between in this context the difference between the generalization the generalists and

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.850
The specialists and we've agreed

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.210
Multiple occasions now that we don't like either of these guys

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:51.450
But the difference between in the model that we have right now specialists have something concrete that they can

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:59.030
Put their hat on and the generalists because they're evaluating the system. It's not concrete

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.280
It's hard to measure. It's hard to at a review cycle

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:10.200
I'm known for being a change agent. I can talk to a bunch of people every team. I've left in the last

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:18.750
Four teams has been extremely sad to see me go because they know how I've helped change the culture

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:26.230
And they know that I how they know subjectively from a personal standpoint that I've accelerated them and the culture

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.750
But you can't measure that crap. Well

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:37.260
Everything has don't you can but no one does not you're right and many many many podcasts go I

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.460
talked about

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.100
You know how I value people on my team's and I again

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:48.860
I don't manage people but I put a lot of effort into thinking how do we value these people and I think the traditional

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.670
dev

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.670
programming manager

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.170
Mindset is I value you based on

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:03.810
Output and maybe the difficulty of that output. Maybe those two factors

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.610
That's a little little bit of a twist and summary of what you just said

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:13.450
Yeah, how would you get done? How hard was it to do? It's size complexity and date

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.190
Hitting your shift date regardless of the quality on that date

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.170
Whereas I you know working

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.120
mostly with test teams in my career

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.460
I am looking at output output is something I value. I'm also looking at

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.340
It's like three or four things. I'm really gonna make sure that you do one is output

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.720
You're getting work done to business impact of that output

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:45.320
I've seen a lot of people do go off on researchy science project kind of things that are really complex really hard

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.940
But don't really impact how the team does work and business impact can be bottom line on the software product

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:58.250
It can be engineering efficiency on the team and then the other really important one is how well do you work and help with others?

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.050
And that's where the generalist

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.890
Can show some value the person is more of a generalist is gonna have lots of that you go

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.970
Well, I helped out here and I helped that here and I did this and I helped these people work together and

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:16.640
as you know at Microsoft at least we don't have a good any system really for measuring peer feedback or how

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Well others perceive you

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.160
And that blocks that a lot

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:27.320
So you have to do a lot you have to as a manager instead of spending your time in the work item tracking system looking at

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.360
Who's getting what features done instead as a people manager?

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:37.320
You actually have to interact with people instead of your damn tools in order to figure out how your team's doing

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:43.020
And to me it's not rocket science and I had I had I don't want to single people out

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.120
I had a director of dev come to me once and say if we were doing things in a more

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.600
Agile manner and we're doing things like you're talking about Alan. How do I hold my devs accountable?

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.560
How do I know if you know who is who is pulling their weight and who's not I said look

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.440
Get your head out of the work item tool if as a manager

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:08.400
So you're you're you're direct report if they don't know how everybody on their team is doing these aren't large teams

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.160
If they don't have an idea of who's pulling their weight and who's not outside of the work item tracking tool

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.760
They're not gonna know inside you need to get your head out and pay attention to people

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.120
I kind of crawled up on a soapbox without using the soapbox theme, but we have a soapbox theme

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.480
I don't know. Oh, but I didn't like yell. I didn't like announce I was getting on the soap

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.840
I didn't announce I was getting on the soapbox nor do I need to but I got there and

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.550
Went off a little bit, but I think you get the gist of it

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.330
You need to if you want a unified engineering team or an agile team

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.890
you need to get out of the practice of

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:55.490
Counting work items done and features done as the sole way of measuring how much value someone has for your organization

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:01.990
it's like the current problem as I see it is it's

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.430
Hawthorne's effect gone awry

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.690
You get well, yeah, you always get what you measure

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:13.530
You do but what what they have is that they have sort of this principle around

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.490
more features

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.840
right

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.040
Not even balance as to whether or not that feature added value or was a waste

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.500
Right the fact that you just finished the FUBAR widget feature

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.660
and

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:34.320
Three days early and it was a month feature and you got it three days early. Hey way to go Alan

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.040
Thank you the fact that no one's using it

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.930
And it sucks

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.170
Sure

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:47.810
That may be why no one's using it right the but in in the current model. That's PMS problem

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.810
I built the requirements I built to the requirements

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.170
right, whereas

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.170
in an agile model

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.450
when deployed

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:03.810
Right it the works not done until you validated that it achieved the goal not the requirements, but the goal

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.440
Why are we building this feature?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.250
I

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:13.530
Get that same question quite a bit. There's this concern about

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:17.850
People not being able to

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.410
differentiate in an agile process people

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.290
Not being able to scope to their to their ladder level

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:32.930
And how do I track these guys? How do I hold them accountability? I think it requires and to me it's just

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:40.290
It requires a different manager mindset different management style than the traditional command to control bean counter management

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.930
The thing that I I tell each and every one of them

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.910
I'm like look I'll try to argue and tell you how it works

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:55.640
You're not gonna believe me and I'll say the easiest way is you try to execute it for a few months

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.600
Because the one thing that happens with the model is that you become more it becomes more transparent

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.720
Actually how the team functions

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.840
You very clearly understand

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.160
there's a there's a couple of people who are very talented at accelerating and helping others and

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.350
You you begin to see

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:25.290
How that has positively affected the team even though in the extreme they may not even have an area that they directly own

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.250
right sure the

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:35.090
You it gives you the ability to see the system and begin to measure it and

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.510
In the system is what matters not the local optimization

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.430
Absolutely. So on my team. I

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.980
Shouldn't call out my team. So on a team very close to mine that is not Alan's team

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.060
so

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:55.620
Despite our best intentions we ended up in sort of a feature rush

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.500
So let's get the work items done. Let's get them done by the date

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.060
We said they get done and then we'll deal with another

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.080
Terminator not super happy with a stabilization phase

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.180
Yeah, where we try and test quality into the product or sorry where we stabilized, right?

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.140
and

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:19.540
What happens in these is when we we find and identify and remove all the bugs that we just spent

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.620
The last 48 hours adding to the product, right, right? So I

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:29.870
Want to ease into a little bit more on the hero topic and friend and I have talked about heroes before and and heroes are

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:35.210
Okay, if someone's role on the team is to be the hero and often that can be like the super

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.660
You know the super general stuking I can be the hero here. I can be the hero. That's my job

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.560
I gotta go figure things out

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:48.840
But I think what often happens on a team where you're driving towards a feature complete deadline is you celebrate the hero who?

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.960
Stays all weekend to get the feature done

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:56.700
Stays all night get the feature done and then you celebrate that same hero again when a month later

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.200
he stays a whole weekend to fix his backlog of bugs and

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:08.080
Is it just me or does that seem like the wrong sort of hero celebration? It's absolutely wrong

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.860
We're so almost a rhetorical question, but I'm glad you answered we're celebrating

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.190
Doing what it takes to hit the date

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:23.870
Yeah, and and again it goes back to we're talking about before think about what is the goal

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:27.370
If you want to celebrate and I'm all for publicly celebrating

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:36.150
Things on software teams, but you want to publicly celebrate the things that your team values because it encourages other people to adopt those values

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:41.110
You're gonna encourage hitting the date people gonna go. Yeah, I want to hit the date, too

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.790
I'm gonna write crummy code

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:46.990
But what you want to value is I want to celebrate Wow Brent

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:51.190
You did a lot of work to help the team out here you you improved our efficiency. I'm gonna celebrate that publicly

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.670
I'm gonna celebrate the fact that

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.990
Developer Joe or team fubar has

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.380
Finished their feature and say that zero bugs the entire way through

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:08.940
I want to I want to celebrate those things and I want to celebrate the behavior I want to encourage

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.860
Yeah, if I don't it's just maybe a better way to put that is I don't want to celebrate

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.980
Someone staying all weekend to fix a bunch of bugs they created because they were hasty in the first place

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.860
Because that is not the behavior. I want to encourage. I may just for morale

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.220
I make I may say thank you to that developer in person say hey

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.700
I know you know you were behind and under my breath

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.140
I'll think because you wrote crappy code because you're in a hurry and you relate in the first place and blah blah blah

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.460
It's probably not his fault

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.980
But I don't want to publicly celebrate behaviors that I do not want the rest of the team to adopt

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.790
Yes, that's correct and I want to do the opposite

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:51.150
If I want if I'm a people manager again getting my head out of work item tracking I

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.070
Want to think about what are the behaviors?

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:57.830
I want my team to have and then when I see examples of that

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.790
I'm gonna be do a big woohoo and celebrate them because people like that

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.430
That's even that's even more motivating people sometimes than than money or other things like yeah

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.990
I want to be celebrated like that person. I'm gonna do that thing, too

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:18.550
Yes, I'm big on team values and I and I think that sometimes we blow them the in software in general and

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:26.340
At Microsoft off my soapbox again. I gotta stop bringing the damn so you know that we got to find a way

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.860
to

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:36.390
Step wise kill the hill hero culture at this company and it's pervasive

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.690
Sort of a catch-22 death spiral and I think it yeah

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:46.410
It is and my belief is that we get it because we celebrate the wrong things, but I know you have some more thoughts

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.250
I'm gonna step off my soapbox

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.610
There's put my hand over my mouth. There is a

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.130
There it reminds me of a discussion

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.780
that I had with one of my

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:01.260
Mentees there's a guy who I'm training to be an agile coach

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.370
and

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:05.850
one of the

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:11.540
He wanted to have a discussion around. How do I how did he take the current system?

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:19.450
and better light up empowerment that with with some sort of the

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.090
the benefits of

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.890
Heroism but but align it towards business goals

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.430
and

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.830
We talked about a process

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:38.750
essentially similar to like the the 20% project that Google had

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.020
Has ish

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.060
Now our system that we do we have a

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.900
subjective way of measuring

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.350
How will we're doing in terms of delivering ROI?

00:37:53.990 --> 00:38:02.030
Okay, so we have a way of sort of accounting for business value of the ticket expected and then sort of a validation

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:06.070
process at the end, okay, and I said well, here's an idea

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.310
What if we were to say?

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.990
From here on out

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:19.060
We'll do 20% type of project now for a typical employee. That's one day out of a five-day workweek. I

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:27.080
Said alright, here's something that I would be perfectly content with doing I could I could lay out a rule to my team

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.170
Hey team from here on out

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.980
we're going to be

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:38.660
Measuring and improving. What is the the rate at which we're providing ROI?

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:48.560
Okay, so measure of business over cost business value over cost if you guys have an idea

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.660
that and

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.500
Your idea is likely to exceed

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.060
the general rate

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:03.120
Meet or exceed the ROI that the team has been basically doing off of our backlog plan

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:09.900
You are permitted to just do it as long as it costs no more than one day

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:17.830
To to complete that effort you'd so as long as it costs no more one day and it's a higher ROI

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:22.040
Just do it. You don't even need to talk to me if you have an idea

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.240
It's gonna cost more than that

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.360
then you

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.140
You have to talk to me before we do it because I want to hear those things if there is a way that I can

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.360
Use my team's assets to provide higher ROI

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.510
fantastic

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.830
What that is beginning to do

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:45.870
When you when you when you have those type of conversations and you say business value first

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.230
everything else is is

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.030
Some form of guesswork

00:39:55.090 --> 00:40:00.450
Then it changes their behavior they're focusing on this is my goal not

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.590
How do I make how do I make what I own?

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:11.190
Sound cooler than it actually is and then own it so that has the cheapest amount of effort required

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.550
right

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.270
Their goal is local optimization. Mm-hmm

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.780
Whereas I'm fine with local optimization as long as you're targeting

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:26.520
Something that the business values. I would love to be able to see in the longer term

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.520
I would love to be able to see people to have a simple equation. This is how much we paid you

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.040
This is the value we got out of you

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.640
This is this is a

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:41.670
Our profit margin on you Alan and then if it goes too high you're like hey

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.550
It's time for a promotion. I

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.820
Don't know I think you were a few years away, but I actually think that that's a goal that's achievable

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.460
Yeah, I think it's you're right that those things that ROI becomes more difficult to

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.580
measure in the generalist

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:04.660
Don't you think you need to have it a nice you never well give me an example

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.500
Not in it. So I'll give you an example. Thank you

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.700
I

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:14.220
met with with my my VP a couple weeks ago and

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:20.580
I said top of mine. What do you think is the number one thing? My new bosses org

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.180
Really needs to go after and he said he increased

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:31.700
Operational velocity of the team. Okay. Now if you think of those terms

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.560
That essentially means he wants

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.980
Quality to be high for the customer point of view

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.080
But he wants to

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.080
Sort of speed up

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.490
How long it takes to go from idea to quality?

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:55.860
From an operational point of view. So this means the engineering system

00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:01.700
This means the the preventative gauntlet and this means the reactionary gauntlet

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:08.460
Right my my part in this particular problem is to help correct the customer goal

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:14.420
Now if you take those pieces and break it down further

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.980
Right. There's there's essentially this long ass workflow and

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.920
all of them

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:29.170
Would likely have their own little metric. Mm-hmm as well as measuring the whole system

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.050
right the reason why

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.050
His goal is harder

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:40.720
Is because there's there's probably I don't I'm making things up 20 different things that I got to

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.040
Consider as well as come up with a whole in the end measurement

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.560
How do I measure operational velocity and then how do I prove that I increased it?

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.120
So two things come into Miami and tell that story

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.800
Three things one is I think it's great. That's a VP's goal

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.680
I wish my VP had the same goals. I'll leave it at that

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280
to

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.880
One of the ways I describe what I do is I'm a big fan of the lean startup and

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.680
What I do is try to improve or make more efficient the build measure learn loop

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.840
Yep sounds a little bit along those same lines

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:26.360
It is and then the other thing I'm a big fan of theory of constraints and figuring out where to optimize where not where it

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.360
It where there may be easy pickings, but it's not the best place to optimize

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:37.360
Looking at the system and figuring out this is the place where we need to target first and then we do that within and

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.080
Just watching the system changes you make tweaks to improve in different places

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.240
Like here's a thing where we take for granted takes a full day to do but actually

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.840
Do we need to what if we only did this much to still get the same value?

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.680
90% of the value in one hour instead of a full day. Yeah, let's make that trade-off. Yeah

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.240
The

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.560
You're exactly right and that's how I'm approaching

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.960
Yeah, because maybe we can get that other 10% back somewhere else where that isn't a bottleneck

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:09.680
But the first thing is I have to come up with a measurement for increasing operational velocity

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:17.400
That is agnostic to the system underneath. Yeah, and then drive that to be the goal everyone's going after

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:22.130
Because what I want is the high level goal to be the goal

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:24.450
so I want to

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:30.050
Discourage local optimization like if someone if someone discovers hey

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:35.050
We did this big goal. We break it down into these small pieces. We go this

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:43.090
Our ability to do deployments is the the bottleneck. Mm-hmm. So they speed that up. Okay, woohoo

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.650
Deployments have now shrunk to being only 1% of the cost of the originally were

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:53.130
But what they failed to notice is that by doing that the way they did it

00:44:53.530 --> 00:45:02.050
They changed the process and now they've made two other pieces in the system three three times more longer focus more longer

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:08.050
Focusing on longer focusing on the end goal is really important. Look at that. Like in my case a build measure learn loop

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:15.480
I want to think how what is the cycle from I got some feedback. I made this change

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.440
I deploy this change I get new feedback that helps to

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.800
Validate or give me more information on what else to do with that change

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.380
how quickly can we do that whole loop and that goes from everything from the from

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:33.840
Local development to our CI system to deployment to data systems and how that data is analyzed how that gets back to the

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.680
Back to the developer. So there's a whole bunch of pieces in there

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.520
It's really easy to optimize in the wrong place

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:47.760
But the goal is however that first thing all kinds things can happen and all kinds of different things you can measure

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:53.600
But if you focus on that one goal of I want to do this and then also taking time to step back once

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:59.160
Well, make sure that this is actually important and actionable and maybe asking questions like I'm getting way off on a tangent here

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.480
But is it possible to get too fast?

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.790
like say

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:11.000
Let's table that for Nick. Okay. All right, but let me let me it's our time is done, but I want to add

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.420
One thing to you so that that time through the loop is known as cycle time

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:24.260
Okay, but when I was talking about increase operational velocity, right? There's really two things there number one

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.460
This this thing called operational velocity

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.280
Which which is its own distinct goal?

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.810
But in my ability to increase it so I want to be able to increase this operational velocity

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:42.710
But over time I also want to increase my ability to increase the operational velocity

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.070
So there's this concrete

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:50.360
KPI that I'm trying to move and then there's this cycle time which is sort of

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:57.590
The speed at which I can move it. So if you think of just the term velocity, which is distance over time

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.870
It's the same thing

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:03.990
There's something that I'm trying to move and there's a speed element in which it's the speed in which I'm trying to move

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.670
It I can pivot each of these things if I could

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.720
Increase the distance of movement in the same amount of time fantastic if I can

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.480
Same distance but increase the speed

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:22.300
Also fantastic or decrease the time. So a lot of these things are really two different things

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.980
Anyway, anyway, I think we're out of time. I'm pretty sure we're out of time

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:33.860
So thanks for listening to our 20th episode. We back for the big 21 soon and our

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.580
Anniversary episode. Thanks guys

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.420
We can't sing the song because it's cop we have to pay like a fee to someone

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:46.500
No, that one's on public domain. Is it? No, it wasn't for a long time. Is it? Yeah, it's public domain

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:53.060
But I don't really write day, but a anniversary anniversary. I don't know a happy anniversary. So never mind. All right, everybody

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.460
I'm not Brent and I am NOT Alan and we'll see you next time. See ya
