Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.260
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.580
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show we're back again I'm Alan

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.780
I'm brain and it's an episode of a B testing it's to be clear our 145th

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:37.230
episode of season one of a B testing where did you go so here's the deal

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.190
where did I go Brent you well your voice like dropped like 25 decibels which is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.390
gonna be fun for me later but also Brent because he's on Windows can't get his

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.090
camera to work so now I can't tell where his microphone is I can't tell what's in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.010
his hand I can't tell what he's eating it's a it's a black hole on one side of

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.770
the podcast today yeah so we are me and the three are all gonna are all going to

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.850
enjoy how quickly does Alan trigger when he doesn't even know what the hell is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.690
Brent doing now Brent was a couple of minutes late and I was moments away from

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.890
just sending a message out to Twitter and saying first DM reply gets to be on a B

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.770
testing with me this week unfortunately I lost and it's Brent again but actually

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.490
you can still hear that no no no this is a conversation that the one I want to have at least a little bit today maybe the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.970
whole time we'll see what happens we'll see what once we get out of our

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.910
tangents is probably better for you and I how you been what's new anything

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.430
exciting yeah I don't think I mentioned this in our last podcast so I'll just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:08.230
proactively say I regretfully inform you and the three that I survived my surgery

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:16.350
last Friday Oh what surgeries you have oh that fear your wrist no no this is I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.000
was thinking about it on the way and wait did you finally get the lobotomy I'll

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.520
let you finish that's that was me attempting to do a drooling noise no I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.800
had a hernia repaired ah and they feel the skin back and shove it back in and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.080
sell you back up no and it's unfortunate I was like a horrible doctor I

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.080
would improvise too much it's unfortunate the camera is not working

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.680
for me because then I would absolutely torture Alan and show him all of the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.200
maybe it's the internet sparing me first and foremost up until then I did not

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.240
know what a hernia is do you know what a hernia is yeah I do do you okay for the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.250
listeners then I guess because I didn't I did not know I mean as we've talked

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.650
about before I'm in my 50s now I did not learn exactly what a hernia was until

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:31.610
three months ago and essentially as you get older and I hate going to doctors and

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.890
because I'm now at an age where so many doctors start their statement with those

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.840
three words as you I guess it's four words get older the the wall of your

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.480
abdomen can wear thin when it does one of the purposes of your abdomen is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.840
basically to keep your your keep your stuff for it belongs keep your intestines

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.320
right where it belongs yes unfortunately as a process of digesting things what it

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.240
does is it creates places in your intestines where it will push against

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.860
the your abdomen and normally your abdomen will hold it back what happens

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:27.220
though as you get older your your abdomen weakens and then your intestines

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.100
are able to push through this is so disgusting and gross ever everybody just

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.140
keep on hitting fast forward until we're talking about something else and

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.580
certainly overexerting like for me the cause I know what it was is I was doing

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.780
yard work and I was acting like I was 18 and and just aggressively moving

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.300
bags and bags of and anyway it can be dangerous when you have a hernia

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.860
because if it's if it's not reducible which is medical term for you can push it

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.860
back through the hole then one of the things that's potential happen is it

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.100
could lose it that part of the intestine that's poking through could lose its

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:25.900
blood supply and die and then shortly after it so will the host excellent yeah

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.340
but they got to put back together like Humpty Dumpty right yep and I got lucky

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.990
my my surgeon is actually known for being one of the best in the north

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.710
Pacific Northwest still I'll tell you that man yeah that's true

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:52.310
little trophy that says I'm the best and and I had performed a robotic surgery so

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.230
I have currently three scars on on my stomach and three itty-bitty scars and

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:09.270
one was for the the whatever the instrument they use basically a surgeon

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.710
chopsticks right itty-bitty little hole that these string whatever that is that

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.910
they do the next hole is for a camera and that that middle hole was is

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.150
literally like an inch above my belly button and then the third hole is where

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.190
they stuff in a tube and they blow me up like a balloon with carbon dioxide okay

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.630
so right now I'm just gonna say for our two listeners who are left could one of

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.070
you send me a message on Twitter in two weeks on Friday maybe midday and remind

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.390
me to not ask Brent what he's been up to that would be great I think it's I

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.510
think it's gonna help the podcast so just thanks in advance for that you don't

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:59.910
you don't want to learn about no let me check on my podcast maybe podcast testing

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:07.560
agile software leadership yeah it doesn't fit oh I'm glad you're okay my

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:15.640
apologies yeah boy oh boy man you are old I was teasing Brent Cronela I've been on

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.430
the planet longer than Brent but for whatever reason you just seem way older I

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:32.440
don't get it yeah it's it's because I'm wiser I think that's it I think it's

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.120
something else we'll figure it out have I been up to anything no yeah I've been up

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.760
to getting mad that the Covid rates are going back up again that's what I've

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.740
come on beeps we we run the risk of waxing political I know all I want to

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:56.340
say is everything I want to say is just gonna landslide into just be careful out

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.820
there don't you don't need I don't know why we're not ready to have big festival

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.380
concerts yet I'm talking to you lala Palooza we're not ready to have Florida

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:12.540
exist I saw a bumper sticker by the way that you'd love it said DeSantis 2024

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:19.740
make America Florida I wanted to I wanted to slap on a just say no sticker

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:25.660
right next to it but I didn't have one with me all right off of the political

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:33.260
podcast on to I I will just say I mean I don't want Florida but I would pick

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:40.860
Florida above California any day I'll just say that right now they're totally

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.500
different versions of crazy sauce and then since we're on it why the hell is

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.680
Cuomo not already impeached what the hell I don't get that either politics are

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.400
broken why why is it that Trump is still even allowed to hold public office again

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.480
in the future if you want why is DeJoy still in charge of the post office

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.840
there's all kinds of crap that's wrong I got two years till my daughter is out of

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.360
college and I'll be accepting free agent offers for the country that wants me to

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.200
move there the most so two more years on my contract and then I would like to I

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.240
like to explore new opportunities in new countries I'm frickin serious it's it's

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.590
just too broken and nobody gives a crap about fixing it no and the people that

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.590
do aren't in the position to do it so it's just it's all about power and money

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:37.350
and not about helping people and it pisses me off so anyway speaking of

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.310
being pissed off I think it's I'd like to talk about this a little bit although I

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:50.430
do find the absolute irony and potential in appropriateness of two white guys two

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.790
white old dudes having this conversation but I still want to have it I'm assuming

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.430
that you and or our listeners are both have at least heard of if not read a

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.270
lot of the articles and accusations around the Activision Blizzard lawsuits

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.830
I have not heard anything about I will catch you up and then I want to have a

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.870
little bit of a talk about it this topic is not the right conversation so is

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.630
Blizzard is Blizzard a customer of unity probably so I probably shouldn't go

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:27.740
into it all I'll say is there is some bad behavior and it's just it just it

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.220
just hurts me to see like someone told me a long time ago that the way to figure

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.580
out what your values are are to think of the things that really push your buttons

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.420
the most and your values are the opposite and fairness is such a huge

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.780
for whatever reason such a huge value for me I can watch a sporting event in a

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.540
sport I don't care about with teams I don't care about but if I see a bad

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.780
call or something unfair happened I just get riled up and mad I can't handle

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.100
seeing things that are unfair probably shouldn't go into the details of that

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:08.850
stuff but just yet another example of people being treated horribly and unfair

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:15.240
I can talk about the times early in my career when I see that saw this at

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.360
Microsoft again I'm not gonna name names it's not fair of me a second-hand

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:28.120
person to do that but one of my friends a woman was constantly harassed had

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.480
sexual propositions made to her by her boss the guy was married with kids it

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.000
went on for a year before he finally at least in this case he finally you've

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.980
heard this before Brent decided to spend more time with his family that's that

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:51.380
the Microsoft line when it went when an exec is fired it wasn't special projects

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.660
it's not well special projects means they're still employed they just take

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.140
them out of their team they removed that they just removed the sore from the

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.380
team but when someone's when an exec that's fired at Microsoft it was almost

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.380
always they decided to spend more time with their family it was kind of

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:13.590
hilarious but you know I saw what are they called microaggressions not as

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.070
much in my last few years there I do say that but early there was a little bit

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.370
more of a frat boy culture and I did see that in some teams and just and I think

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:29.380
given who I am now if I back then I would have done more about it now that

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:35.860
I'm who I am now I don't see it but it just I don't like well let me actually

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.500
take this out of the the negative into the positive a little bit as I can so

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.540
one I'm just mad I'm just part of me is mad this stuff goes on and part of

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.780
me is mad that people can't just treat others I just don't get it I see this

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.260
happen the golden rule man just treat others like you'd like to be treated I

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.720
don't get bullying whether it's male on male male on female female and male

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.870
etc I just it just irks me at all and I just don't want to see it and that got

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:09.300
me thinking about just diversity in tech because another thing happened this

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.300
week totally a different thing but it made me think so Stack Overflow did their

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.700
their survey and they published their results 82,000 responses to the

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.260
developer survey and you're not gonna believe this is a segue alright so and

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.660
they've published the information it's just demographic information nothing

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.690
really exciting here's the languages people use here's the salaries etc but

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:39.490
one thing kind of stuck out with me 82,000 responses 82,286 open to any

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.010
developer going to Stack Overflow who wanted to fill out the survey so they're

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.970
getting a little bit of it there's a bias there I forget which one it's gonna be

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.730
what's the bias when all you have is the people that actually responded

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.920
information and not a full gamut of people whatever that one is right but

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.260
just short of go ahead it there's definitely a selection bias selection

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:08.180
yeah okay so of those 82,000 sorry to keep saying the number 92 just short of

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:17.810
92% of the responses were men just over 5% were women with non-binary and

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:24.610
prefer not to say filling in the rest 92% of the responses were men I don't know

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:32.850
what your teams were like like I was on a team once at Microsoft that was almost

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:38.370
it was like 45% women never been close to that before I went and looked just for

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:44.090
transparency I went looked at my current team and it's 23% female so I have a

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.770
couple questions but I want to go over today there there's the big lead at

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:55.880
Brent's going Alan this is I'd rather talk about my surgery man yeah so anyway

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:02.360
they blew me up like a balloon with the carbon yeah no no this is this is an

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.200
important topic you know I can commit on this podcast into my team it's like as

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.600
my team grows and next year I'm definitely doubling down on getting a

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.680
more diverse team and not just diversity men and women but all the

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.560
different flavors we can get there I've talked before how on the podcast we have

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.320
and I didn't Brett and I didn't have our yearly business meeting yet well I

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.120
actually have never had one as I mentioned before on the podcast we I

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.880
take all any money I get for talks or courses like the course on ministry of

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.760
testing comm on an introduction to modern testing which is excellent any

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.080
money I get from that anything about modern testing where I'm paid for it

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.440
that money just goes into the AB testing podcast bank fund and it may be

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.360
testing is an LLC just so I can get a tax ID so I can open a bank account for

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:54.040
it so there's some money in that account and I think with your approval no

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.840
pressure man as we're recording I could just delete this part if you don't

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.360
think it's cool I do want to donate $500 each to both girls who code and the

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:08.920
women in tech charities there's 501 3 C's on behalf of a be testing it's

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.520
only a little but hopefully it helps just get a few more women people of color

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.840
etc into into tech because I think we're losing out I just again I go to

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.760
fairness we're losing out by not having I can pick on ourselves just having a

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.710
bunch of white dudes doing the job we're losing out so what do you think

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:34.630
is that cool with you guys spend our money that way certainly I like the

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.790
idea of girls who code like that one a lot when when we talk about the the

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.550
other one that you brought up I'm wondering if it's actually called girls

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:50.510
in tech I'm sorry it's girls in tech org yeah I'm wondering wondering how we

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:56.190
diversify right because it's why don't we do this this is better actually let's

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.430
let's get our listeners help us figure it out I want a be testing to give a

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:05.790
thousand dollars to wherever is gonna we think is as a group gonna make the most

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:12.790
as a community the most difference in helping diversify and in my words make

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:18.510
fair the tech world and it can be one place multiple places I am willing to take

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.990
input on that but I would like to put our money where our mouth is and see if

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.350
we can just make even the smallest little difference here because you and

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:32.350
again you and I sure we're in charge of teams we can do we will definitely do our

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:39.590
part in hiring but we can't do it by ourselves here's one thing and I think I

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.190
may have shared it on a podcast before but I feel like I have right because you

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:50.430
keep talking about two old white people and I'm gonna push back on on that as a

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.830
concept the fact that we're two old white people is meaningless here right

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:01.790
I've done the research and I can sit and I can waste the rest of the podcast

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:07.870
explaining to you why diversity and inclusion are important and it will not

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:16.900
be at all about body parts or color right it it's it's I don't know if I've

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:24.300
I've shared this right so I grew up so I come from what is turned as white trash

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:32.060
roots so there is a lot in my familial history that's in alignment with a lot of

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:39.460
the the poor downtrodden type phenomenon or classic demographics that's what I'm

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:45.860
looking for that that we hear about non-trivially I do not feel any

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.540
association with the term white privilege I personally find that term

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:59.520
offensive because of my family history but ignoring that aspect right the

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:06.320
diversity and inclusion it is let me let me let me just try to summarize it like

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:13.860
diversity why is it important diversity is not about demographics it's about how

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:19.700
you experience life okay and how you experience life is also associated with

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.660
demographics in other words diversity inclusion like what race you are what

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.900
gender you are is not causal but heavily correlated are you following me so far

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:34.100
I am so far all right I'll let you go a little farther before I really back in

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:42.280
all right for example women there's been lots of specific studies around gender

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:49.320
studies that show that women in in leadership positions actually boost

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:57.680
company's performance and it is it is in no small part because women's experience

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.280
of the world is often more they're often less risk-averse they're often more

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:09.520
collaborative they they want to hear the opinions of others right however it's

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.480
not solely owned by women and then there's a lot of aspects where where I'm

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.240
sure you've encountered these where whether certain women that by their gender

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.860
are women but are there actually their style and their training their culture

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.740
or whatever I don't know how they got there but their behavior is very toxic

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:37.040
masculine the benefit of diversity is getting these other different definitions

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:44.800
into the pool of what's right and going these other right ways of approaching

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:52.360
problems are all just as right but they come from different so if you yeah I'm

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.280
losing myself I'm going I'm gonna really in here because I think you're you're

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:03.320
you're walking a thin line and I I am not in a thin line I am and I will I

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:10.040
will assert this like what I am doing is I am trying to share the science behind

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:15.960
diversity and inclusion and around the studies that have been done here and

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.480
diversity getting at the end of the day okay I found a way of doing it at the

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:29.800
end of the day diversity is around getting a diversity of ideas into the

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.940
ecosystem okay and and when you get multiple different ideas what happens

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:44.420
Alan you get great ideas and right I we are stifling we are blocking our path to

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.660
get there because we don't have a way to get those diverse ideas into our teams

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:54.860
right and that's where inclusivity comes in because everybody has their own

00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.020
personal identity they have their own sense of do I feel included or not and

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:06.180
what the science has shown around inclusivity is you will not gain the

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:11.460
benefits of diversity if people don't feel included if they don't feel

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:17.660
psychological that's exactly the topic I wanted to get into I will I don't want

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:23.060
to dwell on this I will say I will disagree with you on on white privilege

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.860
being offensive I think it's a thing and I think there are plenty of studies that

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.540
would show it would exist but I want to move on because what can happen exactly

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:38.060
what you said is the problem is is we read and what I saw what I have seen is

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:43.700
that you can get into a situation where people are afraid to speak up they're

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:49.500
afraid to put their ideas in there they don't have psychological safety and you

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.620
don't get psychological safety by itself it has to come with transparency and

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.180
accountability though to me those three things have to work together so what is

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.240
psychological safety Britain I kind of already defined it but go ahead no no

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.960
no but before yeah because before we continue on like the one thing I also

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.400
want to call out you and I being old white guys is not what matters here what

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.520
matters here is that we prioritize collaboration psychological safety and

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:26.650
the birthplace of ideas those who don't like in your position at work Alan if

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:34.560
you got replaced by someone who fit this other characteristic but lost that

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.880
environment that goal that initiative you have around psychological safety I'm

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:45.000
gonna say is harming that company okay yeah no I agree that's that's all I'm

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.560
gonna say I think there's too much of this focus on on on birth characteristics

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.560
but I'm gonna get I disagree but let's go on psychological fair enough

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:02.600
psychological safety is essentially the construct or it is where you have an

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:11.000
environment where people can feel they can say what they view is a true view of

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.960
the world and not be bullied by it feel and not face any repercussions and not

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.720
face repercussions right and it's critical to call out but there's no way

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:30.480
to have like one of our values unity is best ideas when that statement can not

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.560
it can never be true without psychological safety because you'll never

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:42.480
you never have even a remote guarantee of hearing all the ideas well and actually

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.320
you don't even want to hear the I mean you just want the ideas to be breeding

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.800
with the other ideas right right and if the ideas are silent how is that gonna

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.280
happen and I have a bunch of ideas throughout here also but it's I think

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.760
it's worth it to talk about what are some things what are some things you do

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.640
in your order what are some things you've seen that work to help build a

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.160
culture of psychological safety so I am constantly working through this there

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.920
are two things that I have done in the past that worked very well on this

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:23.690
number one is I ban well the very first thing that I did is I would have an

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:29.810
individual speak up in detail what they are going on and then I would give them

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:35.290
permission and I've shared this on the podcast before it's essentially during a

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:39.170
retrospective the person who's sort of walking through what happened is often

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:46.450
generally the person who did the work and I say all right you are to you are

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:51.560
to tell the story and everyone else in the room is going to operate under the

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:58.040
assumption that you were perfect in every way right and that it was actually

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.200
the rest of the team if anyone's to blame it's the rest of the team we let you

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.380
down and the team's job is to figure out how how did we let you down like if this

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.640
ticket usually in retrospect we're talking about tickets that went into

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.800
the weeds and it could be in that creates it a an environment where each

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.840
individual as they listen to the story they're they're now thinking through

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:29.890
okay how did I actually let this this person down like I actually saw like

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:35.470
stand up two weeks ago I thought this thought but I kept it quiet right and and

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:42.620
now now this this ticket suffered the the team suffered so I started thinking

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:48.420
through the consequences of this independence in a way that forces

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.580
individuals to collaborate together other times other times I've I've as I

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.580
mean a very simple technique is you you look for and you simply ban any

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:03.180
semblance of blamewang which just ban it that's like setting the framework for it

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.180
but I've also found you have to keep kindling the fire because even in an

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:13.380
organization that has a pretty good level of psychological safety you'll

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:20.240
still find occasions or people feel afraid to make a mistake or they they're

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.200
not public enough with their mistakes which of course eliminates the ability

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.560
to or the opportunity to learn from those mistakes which is the thing I want for

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.440
example we review as I mentioned before we have a weekly review weekly team

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.400
meeting where we look at projects and dates if someone has to move a date the

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:44.500
only real question is okay cool what did we learn and emphasizing that learning

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:52.430
another thing is one thing that helps in my org is my pure what would I call this

00:27:52.430 --> 00:28:01.520
pure unabashed oh I'll put it this way I consciously or unconsciously I you know

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.960
my idea thing the way to get good ideas is get a lot of ideas and throw

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.080
the bad ones away they watch me screw up all the time by or watch me propose

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.680
dumb ideas and when there's somebody pushes back I won't give the exact example

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.360
I posted something hey I was talking to so-and-so we thought it'd be great if

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.800
we did this what do you think and what can happen in an org without

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.240
psychological safety or a hippo or where the highest paid person's opinion

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.160
matters the most they would just be yes sir we'll go do it but instead even

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.080
one of our newer employees it was great he pushed back and told me why it was

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.920
a bad idea and then I very quickly and publicly said thank Tim for pointing that

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.760
out and said you're right we shouldn't do this makes a lot of sense and just

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:47.520
it's continually finding those examples of showing people it's okay to speak up

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.880
it's oh there's not a hierarchy or a rule you have to follow one of the

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.760
things that pushes my buttons of has to do with fairness or just lack of

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.480
safety is the there's probably a name for this move you know when I'm when

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.720
Brant when I can't get you to do something so I get I tell my boss to

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.560
tell your boss to tell you to do it that up and over and down if that ever

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.840
happens I just flip out do you yeah I cannot handle that if you need

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.080
something ask for it yeah I have it probably nothing to do with safety but

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.240
it just it got me thinking on that track no so for me I don't I actually don't

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:37.310
flip out on that one I internalize that I introspect I go I now at a point where

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:43.420
I operate on the assumption that I had not earned this person's trust and

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:49.580
that's why they did it and I so and then that actually is also the way I then I

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.700
then go and do the confront yeah and to be clear I don't flip out externally

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.380
just it pushes my buttons inside I just I will just have them go contact the

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:06.180
person directly but right but I will tell you I will tell you if the reason

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:11.780
why they did that so where it happens with me the most often is because they

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.920
did talk to me and I told them no and they didn't like the answer right and in

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:22.560
that one they still need to have that discussion I right I believe in managers

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.220
but not hierarchy and I tell my team that all the time we have managers but

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.700
not hierarchy and sometimes people who are a skip level or two below me they'll

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.140
ping me on slack say I'm sorry to bother with you on this directly but you know

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:41.380
it's like and I remind them don't be sorry we have managers not hierarchy and

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:46.260
anybody and that's one good thing about it's usually a new employee one thing

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.860
about unity in my org especially because I care about this is everyone is

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:56.780
everyone feels comfortable or should feel comfortable talking to anyone and of

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.860
course as my organization grows it's a bigger fire to keep kindled and that fire

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:07.220
is psychological safety accountability transparency the the other thing that you

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.180
just called out just to shift back to that like I do think one thing that's

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:16.700
really important is to lead by example on that one as a leader I admit my

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:24.180
mistakes all of the time I will publicly do stuff self-deprecation all of

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:31.140
the time I I I apologize to my team and go wow you know what if you guys didn't

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.180
report to the world's worst manager this would have happened this way but it

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:40.340
didn't it happened this other way right leading by example where where

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:49.340
specifically I acknowledge my mistakes and that I show what the preferred

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:57.710
behavior of the preferred action would have built basically creates trust within

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:04.550
within the team and we have much more friendly conversation yes and let's talk

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:08.630
about trust for a minute like actually you're going so I want to pivot yeah

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:13.470
that that's where I was going I think trust is that basis of psychological and

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.030
there's another model that fits in well with that term it's it's the the

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:22.830
pyramid from Pat Lynch on his five dysfunctions of a team talks about the

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.470
first dysfunction is trust if you don't trust each other if you don't have that

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:32.990
safety you can't have the in his words you can't have he calls it conflict I

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:38.350
like I prefer debate if trust is missing we're afraid to have that debate

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:43.830
and we and we or we take the debate personally and we can't flesh out those

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:49.110
ideas the way we need to if we can't debate over what about this what about

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:54.550
this what you think we should do this we have to be able to have a debate and

00:32:54.550 --> 00:33:00.630
discuss and not be afraid to tear someone's idea down or to build someone

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:05.190
else's idea up in order to come up with the best solution but without trust you

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:10.670
can't have that healthy conflict and then once you can have that debate then

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.950
something Amazon calls disagree and commit a lot but that and again not

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.870
putting Amazon's in model company but without that debate people aren't

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:24.630
committed you have a lack of commitment people feel like okay they're doing what

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.910
they want to do I think it's the wrong thing I'm not going to support it if

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.510
you feel like your voice was heard and decision is made that wasn't entire you

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:34.350
know wasn't the thing that you wanted to do you've you've had enough debate

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:38.190
about it that that commitment can be shared across the team without commitment

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.190
you can't have accountability because I'm not going to be accountable for a

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.110
thing or I've shared accountability for a thing that I didn't believe in and was

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.590
thrust upon me by the hippo and without accountability you can't get results so

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:57.270
this basis of trust or psychological safety is critical for flow of

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:03.030
productivity and output and well team health which has also been studies

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.310
shown as correlated to organizational health is directly correlated to the

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:11.830
quality of product that organization produces whether it's software or

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.990
whatever but organizational health is critical and it all starts with that

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:19.910
trust a psychological safety then you can build on that and get a team who

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:25.150
actually gets crap done yeah yeah actually you said it in a different

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:29.470
distinct way than I would have but I completely agree with everything you said

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:33.910
the because I'm absolutely right go on like the single most important book

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:39.980
I've ever read on this topic is one called getting to yes and it was written

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.900
by a masterful negotiator and it's a it's around how how do you have

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:50.680
discussions and it's still very valid value today and one of the key things

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:57.000
is how do you how do you convert what they call a positional argument to a

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.040
principled argument so a positional argument in this particular case is for

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.480
example let's say I disagreed with the topics that Alan wanted to present for

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:15.360
A B testing okay well he is in the position right he has all the the

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:23.360
editing equipment he has the recording equipment he absolutely could say well if

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.680
you don't agree with me Brent then I guess the podcast is over for today but

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.880
he I could I don't imagine you would ever do this but you could always do

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.220
the I'm gonna take my ball and go home strategy because you're in the you're in

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:42.540
the position of power on that discussion okay but a better approach would be a

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:49.780
principle one okay okay Alan I propose this as the the topic so one of the

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:55.700
things that I do with that focus is I try to convert it to anytime I see a

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:01.900
dispute anytime I see a discussion right how do I turn it into a principle

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.900
discussion versus a positional one and just as a metaphor when I'm very fond of

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.780
a a difference in this is this a Alan you and I were we're disagreeing on

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.180
something I'm not gonna try to flesh out the podcast metaphor it'll be too long

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.860
winded right in a positional discussion you and I are sitting on opposite sides

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.660
of the table and then generally one of us is gonna win and the other one's

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:34.900
gonna lose a positional discussion is is often always about it always results in

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:41.000
a win-lose proposition in a positional or a principal discussion what what we're

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.800
trying to do is move you to my side of the table and let's put the problem on

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.900
the other side there are times where where hey I want this this and that and

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.370
I'm like okay but the current implementation is going to take too

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:01.530
long and I need it by this date so can we can we can we come up with a different

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:07.890
strategy right I'm I'm laying out a principle that hey delivering this bare

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:13.670
minimum by this date is an important principle for me and yours you're

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:19.710
stating I'm I'm lost in the metaphor you are yeah but the more you change it

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.910
to say what are the principles that you're making your decision on Alan how

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:28.270
are you how are you thinking through this right the more I can encourage you

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:38.100
to say I move away from hey I'm the guy in charge and I I get to decide and the

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:42.660
more I can shift you to go okay here's here's the principles that I the

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.100
constraints that I wish to have satisfied for for whatever the final

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.700
product is then we shift away to okay how do we invent a new solution and

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:56.500
includes my definition of win along with your definition of win totally get it I

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:01.540
read that book many years ago it's it focuses primarily on sort of the

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.060
mediation negotiation aspect which you've described very well but it's also

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:11.020
knowing when to use those tools versus other tools to make sure everyone's ideas

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.460
heard so I would use it as part of a suite there I did look up though by the

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.020
way disagree and commit was it's a while while it's an Amazon principle

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.740
it's actually attributed to Andrew Grove at Intel whose high output management

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:33.100
book is excellent so that so for me me that book what it what I use it that one

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:40.740
for is it is to sort of help teach my folks how to communicate in the way right

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.260
yeah my everybody every one of one of the things you hear from me all the time

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:53.220
everybody on my team everybody I have ever met is awesome their ideas may not

00:38:53.220 --> 00:39:00.140
be sufficiently thought out and their behaviors may may have some negative

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:05.900
consequences in the context that they're in but they are an awesome human being

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:11.340
and part of my job as a manager is to do the right matchmaking or the right

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.940
behavioral suggestions or teach them how to communicate so that they get their

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:22.700
stuff across in a way that will construct the win-win environment yes and

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.380
coaching employees on communication and framing and all those things and

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.580
listening is critical the one thing missing and again I thought the book was

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:40.910
good it focused a lot on and I guess been 15 years since I've read it that

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:46.710
that mediation negotiation like I said before what it doesn't tell you is what

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:53.230
I recall it telling you is some of the best advice I can give a leader who

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:58.230
wants to have an organization where best ideas women where there's trust and

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:07.100
their safety that they don't do enough of and that is shut up give you got to

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:12.660
give your team room to talk that's how you walk the talk because there's so

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.340
many people who say oh yeah we have psychological safety because I tell my

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:21.540
team we do and and they blah blah blah blah blah and they never shut up I

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:28.120
shut up and listen sometimes I will I will agree with that and I will take it

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:33.600
I don't know if I'll take it at one step further one step back but if you're

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:42.260
in the leader slowed down give additional time like resist your urge to

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:50.700
give advice for as long as you can and get better and better at better at it's

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.500
like learning to breathe or it's learning to hold your breath right

00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:01.220
practice holding your breath for as long as you can and keep practicing it

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.300
because the more your quote-unquote giving giving this advice the more and

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:12.260
more instead of giving the advice ask questions that's the right question and

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.460
let me point you to another book that I think is great and this is not you you

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:22.840
being the three or you bring the coaching habit and so do more coaching

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:28.880
as a manager and when you a good coach a bad coach of crochets give you advice

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:34.160
throw the ball higher hit the ball farther move your leg back but a good

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:40.080
coach will ask you how does your right leg feel there or how does it feel where

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.150
your hands are on the bat what position is your hand in when you release that

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:49.110
shot they'll ask questions you get you to reflect and internalize what's going

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:52.630
on of course there's been some advice before that he can't do coaching it you

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:57.750
can't grow entirely via coaching but as a manager it's getting people to

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:02.870
reflect so they can learn if you give advice that's all you're going to do and

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:07.190
you're gonna spend a lot of time giving advice to your team so they can get

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:12.150
their stuff done instead ask them those reflective questions how did it feel

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:16.830
when you gave that feedback what do you think is what do you think is the best

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.350
way to solve this turn stuff around ask questions the coaching habit is so

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.150
excellent it's a book I've it's not even that old I reread it three times

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:30.750
now because every time I get some ideas that help me help me help other people

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:37.540
grow recommendation over five stars on Amazon that's what I give it if they've

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:43.500
turned it into required training and actually I've just here at Microsoft and

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:50.500
I've just yeah I keep I keep telling you my company made drag its ass out of

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:56.060
the gutter someday after all yep I keep telling you since Satya took over it's

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.620
it's a different place sorry took over when I worked in a toxic environment at

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.940
Microsoft so there is that right but he didn't have enough time to fix that and

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:11.820
I'm I keep hearing Xbox is still a an epic nightmare so I don't know that it's

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:17.060
fully done yet but he's on the right path I absolutely agree with that no I

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:23.260
hope so because yeah as the frat boys grew up and you have 45 year old frat

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.620
boys running the company it was a mess so I'm glad to hear it's getting better

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:30.860
and I trust you and we talked about why team sucks last time so you can go

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:36.700
back to the last episode for that anyway I do want to give our listeners Brent had

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.620
no idea what I was gonna make him talk about today so thanks Brent for that

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.660
conversation when I sprung it all on you but I still have one more thing I

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.980
do it quickly cuz I gotta go have another meeting fair enough trust is

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:56.220
everything okay the they actually the best manager I have ever I ever had he

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:02.080
passed on one rule in these days if you only do one thing as a manager the

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:09.610
only thing that matters is you need to recognize that when you start off

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:16.360
managing people you have not earned their trust and work towards doing so

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:23.130
that is the only thing that matters and I will tell you in my experience that is a

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:27.410
hundred percent correct right you have to do it within a business context but

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:34.050
but recognizing that you cannot be reorged into earning their trust and

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:41.360
that it is on you as a leader to do so if there's any secret rule I would say to

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.080
my success as a manager it is that one all right so I'm gonna build on that and

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.040
then we're gonna close cuz that reminds me of yet another book I want to

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.400
recommend which is Mac Maxwell five levels of leadership and he says at

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.660
first you're put into a position of leadership that's it the next level is

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.900
people have to give you permission to lead them and that's your trust and

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.860
until you do that these bill just like the chonies five levels once people

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:12.020
give you permission to lead them then they'll actually work for you and

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.260
they'll follow through and they'll do work you'll get shared results and then

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:22.420
the next level of leadership is you focus almost all your work on people

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.420
development because people see you as a lead I'm not gonna go into the deeply

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:31.280
in the book to have people development then at the pinnacle it's your job is

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.880
to create leaders and people just follow you because of you because of who you are

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.440
not because they have to not because of hierarchy but because of your leadership

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.360
attributes but you can go read the book but those first two levels really sunk

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.100
your point home for me when I read this book again a book I've read a

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.800
couple of times but first you're in a position of leadership and then people

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.880
have to give you permission to lead them and there's definitely something to

00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:02.040
that people who felt like I'm the I'm a whatever level leader you have to respect

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:07.240
me I just hate that crap no I do not you get nothing from title you get nothing

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.850
from position you still have to earn it screw you and you know who I'm talking

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:18.330
about you I do but well I have one person in mind when you say that and

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:22.530
I'm pretty certain he would fall in that category I've never worked for him

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.810
no I have I have probably another one you're talking about when I was in

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:29.210
engineering excellence and crap I am so late for the other meeting oh my god I

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:33.890
just want to finish one point okay make your point not and I'll bitch on Peter

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:43.950
later all right the last thing I would say on this is be anti-NIH be anti not

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:50.630
invented here in all forms if you see in a team meeting that everybody's sort

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:54.990
of cow-tailing because the one person who is the domain expert is the one

00:46:54.990 --> 00:47:01.720
that's suggesting the advice that means the other rest of the team doesn't feel

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:07.480
like they're part of the solution the way the more you can get them integrated

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.880
and feel like they're inventing it along with that person the more you're

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:18.360
gonna see this inclusive behavior the more you're going to see psychological

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.680
safety that that's obviously gonna start creating some conflicts and some of

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.960
some of the advice we've given today in the podcast will help you mitigate

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:30.240
it but you need to get them having the conversations first then make those

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:36.240
productive I am done go ahead and no I already did so yeah just already done I

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:43.160
am NOT Peter LaFort nor am I we'll see you next time man thanks for the time

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:49.200
today and I'll have a good weekend you too all right
