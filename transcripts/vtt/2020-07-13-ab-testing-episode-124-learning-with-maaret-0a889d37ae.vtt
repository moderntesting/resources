00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.580
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.980
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.660
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hello again, everyone.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.780
Howdy. We have a guest here today. Say hello.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.940
Hello. This is the one and only, and I'm going

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.260
to do my best to get this right. Marit.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.310
I got a B plus. I got, I got a thumbs up. I got a thumbs up. Super happy to have you

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.920
here. How are you doing? I'm good. All good. I think everyone who has listened to the podcast

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.550
probably knows who Marit is. She's a huge body of work, presentations, papers, books,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.900
blogs. You are, and you've slowed down a little bit over the summer, but you crank out blog

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.560
posts like nobody's business. And they're all, it's not like these blog posts that have

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.000
a little blurb of, Oh, Hey, I went to the store today and I saw that cheese was, was

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.760
really cheap, like in depth, well-written stuff you can learn. Uh, which I just saying

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.120
that cause it's not what I want to talk about, but such a breadth of knowledge is what I

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.720
want them to say. Huge knowledge of testing and of development. I've had a lot of different

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.120
roles, but I'm curious. I know you moved on from F secure a while back where you were

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.780
at for a long time, but I'm not sure what you're doing now. So, but how would you do,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.860
what do you do or how would you describe what you're doing now? And maybe I'll just,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.840
we'll, we'll dig into that as we go.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.720
So I took a position as a principal test engineer in a company called Vaisala that does measurement

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.320
devices. I kind of wanted to get into the embedded side of it because I haven't done that yet.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.000
And I wanted to figure out if I can still mix up roles even more than I have ever before.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.960
So I figured I'd rather have my foot, like hold on, on testing. That's why that testing part is

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.120
there. But the principal part is, is giving me a permission to do whatever I like around

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.120
software development, quality, whatever. And my role kind of right now is more like threefold.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.750
I work as a tester in one of the teams, one of the cloud-based teams, but then I work with

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.350
the whole product kind of like end to end. I think we have about seven teams in that product.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.030
So, so get to work with all of those teams. And then on top of that, I get to develop

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.550
testing around the whole company. We have some hundreds of developer people. So,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.390
so I get to kind of pick and choose what I, what I like to do out of that.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.860
Well, that sounds fun. Not the job for the, for the unexperienced person. It's very similar

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.540
to things that I've done as, as Brent will probably tell you, which I love. I'm, I'm,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.340
I'm happy and jealous. And I think it's a great role to get into. How would you,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.500
because I've never had a good answer for this. What if someone comes to you,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.740
Martin says, I want to do what you do. How do they get started?

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.410
I have no clue.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.130
I don't either.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.930
It's really difficult actually to say how to do that. I, I think the thing that I needed to learn

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.210
the most is that you kind of create a mix of all kinds of things that you don't just get stuck on

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.850
one thing, but you create this kind of like, you know, this week I'm doing this and the next week

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.850
you make space for doing something completely different. So kind of making sure that you are

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.810
never missed in your team, that you don't take a role where you can be away. And for example,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.210
going to conferences was a great way for me to learn to do this, kind of like not to create

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.650
that kind of like, you know, I'm the bottle. Like I need to be there for them to release or

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.890
any of that. No, they knew that I'm going to be away because I'm going to be traveling all around

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.890
the world and speaking conferences. So they needed to kind of figure out how to do things

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.410
without me. And it also created this idea that, you know, I can be elsewhere doing something else if,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.970
that was something that I deemed best for the company. And again, there's a lot of people

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.570
that I can talk to, to figure out what's best for the company at a given time.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.650
I think you said a lot of, I can't, Brent's picture is so small. I can't see if he smiled,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.450
but a lot of the words we love, like we don't want to be the bottleneck. And your description

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.810
reminded me of, we talk a lot about generalizing specialists or specializing generalists and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.290
to me, that's what you described. It's like you're a lot about a little, a little about a lot.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.610
But also like 25 years, you can be a specialist at first and kind of like pick up things here and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.770
there. So it's kind of like this idea that every day when you go to work, you can always learn

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.690
something new and it doesn't have to be only about testing. It can be about anything. Like,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.450
if you learn how to cook better, maybe, you know, that might be a useful skill. At least,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.170
you know, you get to eat something good if you learn to do that better. So it's not like you

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.330
need only one kind of skills. And in 25 years, I've had quite many days when I go to work

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.410
with the attitude of wanting to be something kind of like better than I was before. So I think

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.000
that's pretty much how you get to the place, actively learning and volunteering for things.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.420
So many comments and I'm only going to give Brent a chance to interject here, but

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.760
I think you and I both contributed to the around the world with 80 software testers book.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.960
And the article I wrote in there is about this exactly about some advice I was given 20 years

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.770
ago from a VP at Microsoft said, always put yourself on the steepest learning curve.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.410
And which is not being afraid of my story in there, I won't give the spoilers away, but

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.410
just not being afraid to take on new things and like even being aggressive about, Oh, I'll try,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.210
I'll try that and putting yourself in a position where you can try and learn new things

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:13.770
and doing that over and over and over is so valuable. And that's, yeah, I guess I didn't have

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.490
a good answer, but now after listening to you, maybe I do have an answer to that question. Just

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.140
try new stuff. And that's what's kept me interested in, in, in this field for so long.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:32.820
Yeah. The, the thing I'm thinking about, right here in Mark talk, it did also reminded me greatly

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.300
of sort of the generalizing specialists or specialized in general, you know, whatever you

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.060
want to go with the tee sheet person that we talk about so much on the podcast. And

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:54.970
what I find myself thinking is, okay, right. We're, we're all in the industry, 25 plus years,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:06.410
right. And let's, let's imagine some, some fresh new college student just leaves college,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.410
comes and joins our company and they're like, okay, how do I be like you when I grow up?

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:19.780
And part of me goes, you know what, the context in which we were that fresh out of college,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:30.860
that world, I don't think exists at all anymore. And so I struggled with that question because

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:40.250
I think the world in which we started that environment was critical to how we got to where

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:46.440
we are today. So part of me thinks, okay, you know, the generalizing specialists,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:54.280
that is going to persist and solidify. And there's actually a lot of science and research

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:05.260
that agrees with me on that one. But to be like us, when we grow up, from their context,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.300
something specific, like a lot of times it'll be, Hey, I want to be like Alan and be a quality

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.580
coach when I grow up. You know what, honestly, I don't think that role exists in 25 years.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:25.770
Right. It's something else. That's, and so part of me kind of wants to sit back and guide them

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:32.620
towards, you know what, that's a great North star. Let's see what happens. But let's start

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:38.060
talking through what's the most valuable thing to do in the next, in the next year towards that

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:45.610
goal. And then just sort of built, build in the, how do you stay adaptable? And that's where they

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.290
learned something every day and all that comes into play. And I think it's really critical.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:57.050
My random two thoughts. There you go. I think there's a lot to that. It's just, I figure out,

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.050
you know, my, I've described my job for a long time, Mark, I'd love to hear your opinion on this

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:08.650
is I sort of figure out what's not getting done. And I have a good track record of figuring that

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:15.290
stuff out and having the solutions I put in place, whether it's coaching or, or dev work or whatever,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:22.490
I tend to learn how to fill those holes. Yeah. I think of myself, kind of around the ideas of

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:29.370
inertia and entropy, like something isn't moving. I make it move. Something is moving too much. I

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:35.190
slow it down. I love that. I love that. I love that. So Brett mentioned coaching a little bit

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:41.430
and I wanted to ask you about this because there's a tagline on your website, which says,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:47.940
I make people awesome. And what are some ways you make people awesome? Because I love that.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.640
So I think over the 25 years, one of the biggest things that caught to me is this idea that,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.840
maybe we should pay attention to the positive a little bit more.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.560
It's kind of like a thing that test has come with that we notice a lot of bugs and things

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.960
that are wrong and things that need to be fixed. And that kind of feels the days. And at some point,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.080
I realized that if there's a balance of more positive than negative that I notice, it's

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:22.200
probably going to be creating better results for me. It's moving me forward to the things that I

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.660
want to do. And I started really paying attention to all the things, not just the things that were

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:36.020
given to me by the trade that I was supposedly doing. So a lot of the turning people awesome

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:42.070
is working with them and telling them what they're good at and just turning up that

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:48.390
good that they have already. So giving them positive reinforcement. But also a lot of times,

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:54.890
it's like noticing things where we're doing good things and we don't appreciate them unless

00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:00.010
someone tells that I've actually seen people do this elsewhere. And it wasn't that easy. Like you

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:05.530
made it look easy. And since my career has been one where I've been traveling different companies,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:10.090
like every two, three years, I usually change companies and I go and help a new team grow in

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:17.210
some way. What is important is that the team is left better after I leave. So it's not about me

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:23.530
being there, but it's about them growing. So that seemed like a good way of phrasing what I do.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:29.620
So I try to notice what's going on. This is, of course, what Brent and I talk a lot about with

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:38.540
modern testing. So it's just much more eloquent about it than we are. She very aptly kind of

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:49.180
described like she got really close, Martin, you got really close to multiple speeches that I've

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:58.700
given my own team. You're not a manager now, but I'll just tell you what you just described,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:11.350
aptly describes my management style. I refer to myself as my employees MSP. I'm not their manager,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:18.300
I'm their management service provider, which essentially means I don't fire them,

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:25.100
they fire me. They are my customers. My job is to provide management services and there are

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:34.870
distinct goals aligned with that. Anyway, I love that approach, I love that style.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:45.030
My perspective is everybody already is awesome. It's sort of like when Michael Angelo described,

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:52.890
I think it was Michael Angelo, when he carved David. He didn't carve David from his marvel,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:03.610
he pulled him out of the marvel. It was already there. It's just people couldn't see it, he could.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.010
And that's kind of my approach as well. It sounds like that's your approach.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.290
It's very much my approach for the short while when I was a manager myself.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:19.770
It was interesting to notice how many people who should have been given raises before got them

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:26.250
while I was being a manager. So again, they kept telling me that the thing that I do is mostly

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:33.910
marketing. So definitely, the perspective is that it's already there, but someone needs to pay

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.470
attention to it and talk about it in a way that others also appreciate.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.390
Yeah, the term servant leadership comes to mind, which I've read a lot from.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:50.980
I almost said Steven Sinofsky, not it. Simon Sinek has written a lot about that and it's a

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.980
constant around for a while. But yeah, that's what I tell my team too. My job is to help you be

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.340
successful. It's about helping them be successful. Or I like his Brent put it, they're already

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.100
awesome. Help make them awesome or help highlight their awesomeness.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.900
Pull it out.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:15.620
Yeah, yeah. And something you said also, Marta, is as managers or as leaders, even if you're not

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:21.780
managing people, highlighting good things, highlighting awesomeness is really valuable.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.140
Yeah, but it's also valuable for the people who get that appreciation,

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.980
but it's also valuable for the person giving that appreciation.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.740
I find at least that for many of the steps that I found difficult to take,

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.620
kind of like growing and taking bigger roles and getting more responsibility,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:49.220
it came with the positiveness. It came with enforcing some of that,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.180
of course, still kind of fixing whatever is wrong, but noticing all the things that I did.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.500
Your philosophies align so much with the things we've been talking about.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.160
So I wanted to bring up something you put in Twitter a little while back.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.000
And I'm sure you recall the tweet, but you said,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.160
I'm reconsidering my position around the need of testers and teams.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.160
And as a tester, I am not doing this lightly. I am starting to believe that with Agile and

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.520
learning cycles, developers get smart enough not to need manual testers around.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.120
So what's up with that? I kind of want to hear more of the background on that and what led you

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:37.370
there and just more of your thoughts on that. I think that was around when I was changing jobs

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:44.090
and I was looking at my team that I was leaving behind. And I was looking at what the testers

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:49.050
needed to contribute at that point. And they really didn't need to contribute much.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.250
And to some extent, when one of the testers then became a manager for the team

00:15:54.250 --> 00:16:01.450
and started this months-long training into the management world and no longer had time to do any

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:06.920
of the testing, it became really obvious that the team wasn't really missing that.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:18.540
So I started thinking around that tweet. I started thinking this idea that we talk so much

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:24.140
with other testers in the testing communities. We talk about this idea that it's so important

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:30.380
that someone like us is there. And actually, it's important that someone who cares is there,

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:39.100
but it doesn't have to be a tester. And I've seen so many awesome developers taking the role of

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.060
caring for quality and really building in quality and pulling in other people

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.860
for perspectives, including customers, all of that stuff, kind of like every different kind

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.260
of perspective that you might imagine. Not doing it alone, but being kind of the person who pulls.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:05.820
It just feels like the framing that we still have, that you must put someone like us in.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:12.540
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. And then we carve the shape into a world team

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:19.510
that has still a place for us. Yeah, there's a lot of times. A lot of times.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:26.070
So I've spent most of my career as a middle manager in test, although I keep saying that

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.350
and time keeps advancing. So I'm not even sure if that's true anymore.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.800
Right. There's a, oh, you need more testers because you need more testers.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:46.120
Right. It's sort of a cyclical argument. And so then, you know, what are you then

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:54.600
saying? Are you saying, and I'm going to be purposefully sarcastic and assertive here,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:01.960
but are you saying that customers should be testing the code then? Or are you saying,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:11.640
are you, you know, as we all know, Dev can't be objective. So, you know, it seems like you're

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:19.300
saying it's okay to ship bugs. I don't know. I feel like devs can be a lot more objective than we give

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:26.980
them credit for, especially since they work in these short cycles nowadays, where you put things

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.180
in production and you have telemetry where you're looking at how is it actually behaving in the

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:39.220
customer's hands and you care about it even after you delivered it. So it's not like hack and leave,

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.900
but it's much more kind of like continuously building it and making it something that is

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:51.460
worthwhile the time that you put into that. So what I'm mostly saying is, is this idea that

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:58.820
it really doesn't matter that we would have these specialist testers in our teams. It matters

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:06.020
that we have teams and that in the teams, we can collaborate with the other people. And what

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:11.540
maybe concerns me most is this idea that, you know, 25 years ago, you talked about this idea

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.860
that the world was a very different place when we started, when I started growing into being a

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:22.020
tester. I'd still like to give new people chances of learning software development, like I learned

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:29.940
by doing it in the companies, taking smaller roles and then bigger roles. And that's kind of the

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:36.820
position that I leave for junior developers and testers, junior testers as well. Kind of like,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:42.500
you know, getting into some of the easier work first and then very quickly growing

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.660
into different directions. A million percent agree. Part of my agreement statement is that

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.500
I have data, I have helped hundreds of developers now learn how to become pretty good testers. Some

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.460
became great testers, some not as good, but they can learn it and they can be objective.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:05.820
I think I've mentioned most people know that on my team, we don't have any, I'll ask for assistance

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.500
in a second. We don't have testers. We don't have a dedicated QA team. I do have two people on my

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:18.220
team with extensive experience in testing and quality who function as quality coaches for various

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:24.170
parts of the team. Because what I've found, and I'm curious what you found here too, is

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.250
like my boss will ask me, how is our team doing at testing? And I'll say,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:34.330
they're doing all the testing they know how to do, which is good because they're not afraid of it.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.210
They're doing testing, they're running tests, they're running lots of tests and not just

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:43.370
unit tests. They're actually really testing for things. But as you know, I think you'd agree,

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.850
there's always more they could be doing. Other ways to think about approaching testing,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:54.330
other test ideas they could use. So we try and help them continually get a few more of those,

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.090
get them used to evaluating risks so they can figure out which those tests are most important.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:04.090
That's an ongoing learning, I don't want to say struggle, ongoing learning challenge.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.330
But curious what you think about that, David Bart.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:14.550
For me, it's been more on this idea that it's very easy in the team to get in this crunch mode of

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:19.190
you just do whatever you know that you need to do and you do a little bit more of that

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:25.350
and then some more and continuously deliver something. Whereas stopping for purposes of

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:32.390
quality or for any purposes of growing is not as straightforward for people as they would like

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:41.030
to think it is. So whether it's a quality coach or some other kind of coach, making space for that

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:51.590
learning that enables you to grow so much, you can grow in the way that you can be a better

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:56.630
version of yourself. So I often kind of refer to this math idea that if you're 1% better every

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:03.590
single day and 365 days a year, then you're 37.6 times better than you were yourself a year ago.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:10.790
So nothing is as powerful as learning. And sometimes looking at software development teams,

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:16.550
I think the quality related aspect that I bring in is this encouragement that

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:24.950
striving for something better and collecting ideas all around is worthwhile effort as well,

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:31.590
not just crunching code and crunching features and crunching testing into production. So whether

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:38.950
it's a quality coach or something else, I don't really care. I think people have interests that

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:45.750
drive them more towards testing type of roles first, and then growing from there. And I think

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.910
it would be a shame if we lost all of that potential that we have in those people who

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:56.870
right now doing testing roles. But when I'm teaching new people, like I right now, I have a complete newbie

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:03.270
for this summer. She's my kind of like experiment guinea pig. I'm doing all kinds of things with her

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:12.730
and reporting on my results. The way that I teach her is already a mix of programming and testing.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:17.610
And it's already kind of like, you know, you go and fix things, you don't just report them,

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:22.490
you're always balancing the idea that would you already would this already be a good stretch for

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:32.250
you to fix rather than just report and then run away and leave for developers. I love that.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:45.190
Yeah, I love that. I think that's the right way to train. I do think anyone in today's world that

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:59.980
is highlighting that a testers job is to report is saying they're doing a disservice for the younger

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:07.900
testers is just a huge under exaggeration. There's in my mind, there's an element of

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:16.780
of it. It's immoral to do such a thing in to those younger testers in today's environment.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:29.320
Right. That world is I don't want to re execute the test is dead meme. But that world is very

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:37.290
rapidly ending where that sufficient. And I was thinking through additional what you said,

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:44.810
because it reminds me, like what I see Marit doing is sort of she's, she's living.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:53.780
She's sort of a living personification of agility in today's world. She's like, okay, I'm going to

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.260
help encourage collaboration, I'm going to help encourage bringing out the best of folks, I'm going

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:06.890
to help encourage ideas. She's mentioned short cycles, right? And sort of evaluating the ROI of

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:13.930
how people are contributing towards these goals. And she does it with a gentle touch. I think this

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:23.800
is just absolutely fantastic. For me, and being the thing I discovered is that the short cycles is

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:31.320
what really, really sort of motivated Dev has this talent, the problem is, they've never been

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:42.710
motivated to use it. Right. The but the short cycles does that. Right. It in being I said this

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:48.390
over and over again, in being we had the ability within 15 minutes, a check in would be in prod.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:57.800
And under under, under version control or version flighting in a dev would know within another 15

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:07.510
minutes of how key metrics are performing in and whether or not their feature got pushed to the

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:20.010
next bigger flight. And in that world with fast feedback, it's really hard to argue for, you know,

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:29.370
large test teams with sort of a proactive or prevented, you know, prevent this thing from

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:36.060
shipping mentality. That's let me rewind your stack just a little bit. I want to highlight

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:42.220
one thing from Marat that's that could potentially get I do see it get missed on teams.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:50.060
Teams can get addicted to the iteration. Teams can focus so much on deploying 50 times a day

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:56.860
that they don't take the time to learn. And something I bring up a lot too is like you said,

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:02.940
that 1% every day ends up being a pretty big improvement over the year. It's we had a episode

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.940
three or four ago on retrospectives and reminding people, don't try and overhaul the team,

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:15.940
but take some time frequently. I think it's the 12th agile principle and just try and get a little

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:22.180
bit better. I asked teams, don't pick one or two or three things to improve. Pick just one. Start with

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.980
one. Pick one thing to improve this week and try and do a little bit better than you did before.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.780
You do it at the team level, at the individual level. But I love emphasizing the learning

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.820
because the quality and the agility and the predictability and the delivery cadence

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.660
are going to improve from that probably more than anything else.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:47.060
I think pretty much for all of my career, I focused on exploratory testing. That's the thing

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:53.700
that I'm always looking at. And over the years, I've really found learning to be the core of it.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:00.580
The kind of like looking at the application or whatever you're looking at. And it's kind of like

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.540
your external imagination. It's speaking to you. It's telling you what to click and what kind of

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:12.180
things to do and where to use your time. And kind of this active learning while you're doing things

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:19.380
as an attitude. It's the same way that you can approach anything with a learning mindset.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:27.780
So I find that it's become really key to whatever I work on is to look at the way I learn

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:36.650
and look at how others learn. And in the last five years with the pair programming and

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:43.850
mob programming, which I nowadays like to call ensemble programming. I saw that. Yeah. It's been

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:50.410
really great way of not just speculating with other people what they were thinking while they

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.890
were testing, but actually seeing if their actions match what they claim they're thinking.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:02.300
So working together and actually testing together is a lot more powerful way of learning about

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.820
how we learn while we test than anything else I've done before.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.980
I want to talk with you about mob programming, but I'm going to put a pin in that for just a

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:17.100
second because it's not just the tweet I quoted earlier. I wanted to talk about there's a

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:22.140
follow-up reply, which I get all the time. I talk about modern testing and how I've helped

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:29.100
teams move to having no or few testers on their team. People inevitably come up to me after these

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:36.780
talks or after I post something and they say, Hey, this is all great. I'm glad it worked for you,

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:43.780
but my developers don't want to test. And they, for whatever reason, they don't feel like it's

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.660
their job. They prefer having a tester to test their work, which I think is pretty close to the

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:55.300
statement someone said to you. And then something I've saved because it's a great answer is you said

00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:01.300
in reply to that, I'd like to have a personal assistant around too, whether I need one or

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:07.940
whether it makes sense for my company's business is another thing, which is much more eloquent and

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.260
well put than any of the sarcastic, flippant answers I've given to that question.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:20.020
Yeah, it goes into the sarcastic flippant answers category, definitely. But sometimes I feel like,

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:26.900
you know, that some of the developers that I work with are like people who come to our living room,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.540
we eat dinner together, we eat pizza, and then they leave the pizza boxes around.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.980
They assume someone else is supposed to pick up the pizza boxes. It's just, you know, garbage

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:44.340
magically goes away without you doing anything. And not realizing that it's an actual work,

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.860
there's a lot of labor going into, you know, keeping the place tidy and, and remembering

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:58.360
which notes are still untied. I don't appreciate leaving that to me. And I think it might also,

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:08.200
you know, other things around the the idea that, well, we do notice, it's hard not to notice that

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:17.020
my team right now is 50% female. And we have me, the summer trainee, who is a woman, and our UX

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:22.860
person who's a woman, whereas the other three people, the men are the the so called developers.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:30.700
So a lot of times we get also kind of typecasted a little bit into this, almost like a secretarial

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:37.100
role. And I feel there's so much more that we can do in testing that it's almost like, you know,

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:42.140
it's my responsibility of saying that I'm no one secretary anymore. If I

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:49.980
I kind of almost based on what you just said, I kind of almost I love that that pizza box metaphor.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.820
But I kind of wish I could temporarily go back to test just to use this new line

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:04.060
that you inspired. And it's essentially, I want to be able to tell the developer, look,

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.660
I am not your mother. Clean up your own damn mess.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.060
Well, it goes back to her comment earlier about not being the I mean, even in her current role,

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.860
she can't be the bottleneck to do their work for them when when she's there.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.420
Of course, they're doing it better and they have more ideas and she's accelerating

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.780
what they can do. But if she's gone speaking at a conference or enjoying the two weeks of

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.820
finished summer, that was my slight little dig on Finland. But it's okay, I have enough

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:37.100
finished employees to pull that off. But she can be gone and stuff can keep on happening.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:42.140
If you rely on your testing like I've had cases in the past and Brent, I'm sure you remember these,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.580
like, oh, we couldn't deploy because the tester was on vacation.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:54.740
Yeah, the I mean, those happened rarely. There is a lot on that one. It's like the the the

00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:01.220
fact that it's interesting, the fact that my team can survive when she goes off the

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:07.780
conference is probably right. I think about my my my metaphor around type work blocking.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:14.940
Right. Hey, she was gone. The safety net disappeared. And it just so happened no one fell

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:23.740
this time. Right. I think through how we make this more purposeful, how do we make it?

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:34.710
How do we change the conversation like testing is Dev's job. That's the statement I want to make in

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:42.630
and everyone else who's who's trained in this. Our job is to help teach those people how to succeed

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:51.660
in that, in that world in that constraint in that change. That's the change. Right.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:58.540
Short cycles is one of them because people I think that's a great way to sort of change the

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:05.820
environment. So you don't have to have this this conversation head on, which often ends up being

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:16.980
very polarizing. But if you can, if you can shift it to various short cycles and hey, look,

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:24.900
you you get way more way more feedback in shorter time than an army of testers could have provided

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:32.730
you. Right. And now let's figure out how we take advantage of it. How do we even how do we reduce

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:39.850
that cycle time even further? And then it becomes a conversation around. All right. How do we change

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:48.100
the direction around adaptability? Are we going in the right direction? That's the the heart when

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:54.980
you brought up the iteration stuff earlier, Alan. That's the thing I see is the problem. We

00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:04.180
we get used to these super short cycles and it's kind of like going hiking and you're hunched over

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:10.340
and you're looking straight down at the ground. Right. You don't you lose your sense of where

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.880
you're trying to go with that and with it with so you still have to sort of maintain that hey,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.800
put your head up every once in a while making sure you're heading you're still not heading

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:29.000
straight forward the edge of the cliff. Anyway, enough of that. I love having Marit on here.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.280
I'm actually looking I was looking at her website. I'm looking at an article right now

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:44.280
that she published in 2003 titled and she's like, oh, dear God, what is she what is he bringing up

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:52.060
titled increasing understanding of the modern testing perspective in software

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.540
product development projects? Well, that predates our use of modern testing. Oh, well.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.420
Right. She even has an MTP there, right? The modern testing perspective.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:07.660
I do want to highlight the and I'll put some links to this when I post this. But just as I said

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:14.300
earlier, a massive body of work. You have a page even on not even you have a ebook on exploratory

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.540
testing. You have a page with I forget what it's called, but it's exploratory testing notes,

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:25.180
but it's links to it's like you've collected all of your articles and I thoughts on exploratory

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:30.470
tests. Put them on one page massively valuable. But there's one thing I wanted to talk about

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:36.550
as I put opinion earlier. It's something that I have other than watching your presentations on it,

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.750
really no experience. I want to spend a little bit of time talking about

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:46.310
mob programming and mob testing. I've done pair programming and pair testing, but

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:54.120
and I've seen your demos of mob, but I'd like to know a little bit more about how you like,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:59.480
where did this come from and what's been your success and with that and

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.280
and when and why should teams try mob programming?

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:09.930
Five years ago, I organized a conference, by the way, conference organizing

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:17.580
awesome thing to learn new things. And I needed a keynote. So I invited a guy called Woody Zuille

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:26.410
all the way from somewhere around the ocean, US based. And he would fly to Finland to Tampere

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:32.730
and he would talk to us for 45 minutes about this crazy idea that you would have a whole

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:38.890
group of people on a single computer. They would only be allowed to use that one single computer

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:44.010
and they would all be working together on the same code at the same time in the same space.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.610
And I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:56.090
And one of the things that I've learned about learning is that emotions and how I feel about

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:01.530
things is very much of a kind of a thing that you need to listen to. So when you have a strong

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:06.600
emotion, even if it's kind of like, this is ridiculous, saying it's ridiculous without having

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:13.100
any experience on that yourself, doesn't feel like the right thing to do. It's kind of like,

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:18.700
it's not as thorough or honest as I would like to kind of hold myself to.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:24.140
So I went to my team and said, I'd like to try this thing. I just learned in a conference.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:31.340
They pretty much laughed me out. Like, no way we're going to try that. Over six months, I found

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:38.220
the argument with my then team that, you know, humor me, do this just to keep me happy.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.500
And we started doing it so that we would do it every two weeks for a couple of hours.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:51.640
And at first, I was convinced I'm going to hate it. Like, I wrote this blog post where I talk about

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.960
this idea that I will hate it. Like, I have to spend so much time on this boring code and I don't

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:04.200
get to do any of this interesting, you know, user oriented exploration. And then it was really

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.560
funny to read my own notes because I was publicly blogging all the way through this kind of like

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:15.480
how I really changed my mind about this whole idea of sitting there and sneaky, you know,

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.640
saying like, we have been half an hour using the same browser, maybe we should open it in a

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:24.200
different browser. And all of a sudden, nothing worked. So kind of like, you know, anything that

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:30.840
I would want to try, I could introduce it into that group at that moment. And when we had so many

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:36.360
things where I could kind of report that we avoided mistakes, and we could do things that we

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.240
estimated was going to take us like 40 days, we could do it in a day and a half instead.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:49.690
It started making a lot more sense to me that we would do this. So I took it from there to open

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:56.010
space conferences, I learned about how to teach and learn testing in this format. And I've been

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:01.450
doing a lot of testing courses, this is basically my go to way of teaching testing nowadays to anyone

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:05.530
is just getting them sitting together and doing testing and just giving them different kind of

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:11.130
problems and constraints. And you get them learning a little bit different perspectives.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:17.740
That's so cool. You made it sound so fun. I have a follow up question. And well, actually,

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:25.480
two follow up questions. One is, you, even though you thought it was ridiculous and figured it wasn't

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:32.230
going to work, you tried it anyway. What gave you the courage to like, what advice do you have

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:38.840
for people who may feel the same way? I think there's been many things in my career so far

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.720
that I feel that they are ridiculous. Like, for example, I've gone on books saying continuous

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:54.740
integration is insane. That was way back in the days. Can you just briefly summarize

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:04.950
why that was your perspective? I can just briefly. About 25 years ago, it felt like you needed to

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:11.610
control change, that you could test anything you needed to slow down change so that you could know

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:18.500
what you tested. And I was convinced for some reason that instead of giving me the control that

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:24.100
I now know it gives me, that it was taking away all the control that we thought we had back then.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:34.230
And I was convinced it was the worst idea ever for a while. And it's fine that I was wrong.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:40.390
But I have so many of these examples where something that turned out to be kind of core

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:46.790
to the way that I think of things after I kind of give it a chance and learn more about it.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:54.040
And that was what took me into more programming as well. So a lot of times,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.160
the idea of judging something you have never experienced, well, it's just not a good way of

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.920
living. Yeah, I think that reflects back on a lot of things we've talked about today.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.560
But I love that. I think that's good advice for anyone listening, anyone who's

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.800
newer in the industry is you have to get over that fear of trying new stuff. And maybe it fails for

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.650
you. Maybe it doesn't work. You will still learn something. And that's really valuable.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:28.970
My other follow up question to that is, have you tried mob programming or mob testing in a fully

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.730
remote setting? Or does it work better if everyone's actually in the same room?

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:39.930
We do a lot of that in remote setting, especially nowadays when people are just forced to.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.930
There's definitely context for my question.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:49.590
Yeah. So I've definitely experienced that it's easier to get started in a room. Like reading

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:56.070
the room is so much easier. But the basic rules of rather having your camera on and

00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:03.110
making sure it's easy to change who is holding control of the keyboard, you can get it to work

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:08.550
remotely quite as well as anywhere else. And again, if you already know how to work with that group,

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:13.350
then it usually works out just as fine in a remote setting.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:21.910
Yeah, I'm going to commit to trying that. It may just be a feature or a sort of a hack project or

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.910
something in our deployment pipeline, but I'm going to figure out how we can do that. I think

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:31.540
my feeling is I'm a little afraid. People would like, I'm not afraid of it working or not.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:38.020
My fear is that not that I will think it's ridiculous, but everybody I invite to do it

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.220
with me will think it's ridiculous. But I want to try it anyway.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:47.700
You join us. We're trying that next week, Robot Framework Community, which is Finland based

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:57.690
community. They just created a playwright library. And well, one of my old colleagues is working on

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:03.370
that, that Robot Framework Playwright Library. And he was worried that he's not getting any

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:10.250
feedback for his library. So I kind of called it out on him that we could mop together and let anyone

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:15.530
who wants to join us, then join us. And this is pretty much how I learn most of my things nowadays.

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:20.250
I just go on Twitter and say, hey, I want to do this thing with you. Who's volunteering this time?

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:26.890
And I've done sessions, both group sessions and pair sessions with people all around the world.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:34.730
I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner and I challenge myself to learn new things.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:41.130
I'm learning Rust right now just for the heck of it. But I have never met someone so proactive and

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:47.450
I'll say aggressive about learning new things consistently. I think a lot of us want to be more

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:55.690
like that. You don't stop. I think you're motivated by, maybe you told me I'm wrong,

00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:00.250
learning for you is a motivator. It's, dare I say, an addiction.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.870
It's almost an addiction. Yes. It's so cool.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:18.330
Her last idea, I was just like, for me, so the mob programming. So I run a data science team,

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.490
but we do a full stack. So we do data science development and testing now.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:31.480
And this, one of the speeches I tell my team is the three most important things to me.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:40.200
And number one, business value. Number two, calendar time, because it's the one resource

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.800
that I can't scale once it's lost, it's lost. And then lastly, engineering time.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:53.100
And investment in learning is really critical, particularly when we're in the knowledge worker

00:45:53.100 --> 00:46:04.010
space, which all of us are. This idea that, that, okay, all three of us have 25 years of experience,

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:12.760
but this subconscious idea that we all have, that any of it is still relevant today is something

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:21.080
that you have to battle. Right. I constantly go, okay, this is what my gut says I should do this,

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:30.700
but is it really right? The world's changed. But this idea that you just did around mob programming

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:37.740
in an internet context is fantastic because it creates sort of a safe environment. For me,

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:44.620
it's the risk adversity. What's the risk of taking? I have a big team. If I spend them all on this

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:51.980
and it results in an ROI, right? It's the risk of uncertainty. But what you just shared is,

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:56.940
no, no, no, no, no, just find some random open source thing that you love and,

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:04.380
and call out the Twitter. Hey, does anyone want to try this with me? It's then the only thing

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:14.220
that you sacrifice is your time. I think that's a fantastic idea. I think a lot of the new ideas,

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.900
I think the biggest blocker to learning on this front is risk adversity.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:25.980
People, you know, what happens if it's fear? What happens if we spend that time and it doesn't work?

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.660
That's what Mar is, is she's fearless.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.730
I think more than she's taken her head no, but all right.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:41.370
Yeah. I think more than that, she's figured out how to sort of with, with any sort of agile

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:46.810
approach, it's not an all or nothing. It is basically, all right, try a little bit and then

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:53.370
let's, let's pivot or let's pivot from those learning. So she's doing a small batch learning.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:59.130
Yeah. So I'm going to interrupt you and let Mar close us out here. But, uh, I mentioned Philip

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:03.850
Armour's, uh, five orders of ignorance a lot, and they really come down to you need to have

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:09.610
in order to learn for learning, for knowledge acquisition to happen, you need to have a suitable

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:15.610
environment to discover what you don't know, you don't know. And these mob programming sessions are

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:24.840
a prime example of that. I want to do one last challenge to, to Mara, not challenging her

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:31.430
perspective. It is a, I challenge Mar to do this because I think she's one of the few people

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:40.440
in the world that can. So you have a lot of experience of exploratory testing, write a book

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:48.300
around exploratory development. That's all I'm going to say. I think you understand what that

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.980
means even more than what I do, but I think that's the thing the world needs. That's my challenge.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:03.020
We'll wait a couple of years and see what you do with it. All right. Okay. So we need to wrap up

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:08.060
here, but man, this has been great. I thank you for, thank you for coming out of the show. Thank

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:13.260
you for letting me ask my own questions. Um, I, I feel like it was a good conversation, but

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.540
what, uh, what message, what other message or something we didn't talk about or how do you,

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.700
how would you like to close out our podcast today? What do you want to say?

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:30.630
Oh, that's a hard question. Hard one in the end. Yes. So again,

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:37.860
I think all of the stuff that we've been talking about today is really centered around learning

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:44.180
and trying out different kinds of things. I really love what Brent was talking about on the

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:48.820
short cycles. And I wish we would have had more time to, you know, geek out on the short cycles

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.620
and how those change the organization. And what are you doing in two weeks?

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.860
Brent, I managed the calendar, but yeah, you're definitely welcome back anytime.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:06.900
All right. We can talk about that later, but, uh, this whole idea of figuring out the best ways to

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:12.660
learn and sharing in the community sense. I think that's kind of my call to action that I always

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:17.780
have to people. I don't have all the answers. A lot of the answers that I have nowadays came

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:23.530
from people who reached out to me and wanted to have a chat. And, and that's kind of the,

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:28.570
the power of, of having people all around the world who want to figure this stuff out.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:34.250
So if there are any people who are kind of into this stuff, I would be happy to, you know,

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:40.490
do some work, uh, do some mobbing, do some pair programming, do some pair testing, whatever it is,

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:47.050
uh, with, with random people and be open to learning much more new things, uh, in the world as well.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:53.930
I will put links to Twitter blogs, website, everything I, hopefully I remember here, uh,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:51:00.760
