WEBVTT

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.110
Hey everybody. Hi. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we are here for episode 44.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.530
Baby testing. How are you doing Brent? I'm doing swell.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.450
All right, great. How about you? I'm doing swell myself. Also swell.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.650
We are in Brent's building, the palatial offices of Microsoft Building 22,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.800
which I did not bring this up in the pre-show notes like we plan. But this is the very first

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.320
Microsoft building I ever came to. Really? 25 or more years ago.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.800
I did not realize this was a Microsoft building that long ago.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.720
It has been a Microsoft building that long ago. I was a bicycle messenger in Seattle. I did not ride

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.200
my bike all the way over here, but part of our bicycle messengering was involved picking up

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.760
something in a lawyer's office or something downtown, coming back to the station, getting

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.640
in a car and driving it somewhere in the Northwest. Was this a Microsoft building back then? It was

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.720
a Microsoft building. Because the rumors have it that this used to be part of the group help,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.780
a group health. No, I remember when I pulled it. I hadn't been in this building probably since then

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.600
and I pulled it and I thought, no. And you know, believe me, I have read all the studies on how

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.080
memory is fallible and I could be completely wrong, but I'm reasonably confident. This was a

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.360
Microsoft building back then. So what we've learned before we moved into this building

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.920
was that this was an old medical facility. And in particular, floor one used to be the morgue

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.440
and floor five and six used to be the psychiatric ward. This is like the Arkham Asylum Dork

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.590
Edition. Right. It could be coming up right. We're on the insane asylum floor right now,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.490
which I find appropriate. Yeah, could be. Could be. So shall we get on with the episode?

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:27.780
We can try. We can try. So the theme of this episode is data driven. Data driven-ish. Data

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.340
driven-ish. Yes. So we've gotten feedback from many of the three. I guess that would be. Many

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:46.270
would be at least two. Right. Two of the three. That, hey, this data driven culture, this change

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.270
that you guys have been talking about for a long time is interesting to us. How do we do it?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.720
So I thought today has a good theme we should talk about as a tester or even that's we could even

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.520
potentially go further back and just say as a black box tester, if I run a black box test team,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.600
how can I get into the data game? Does that seem reasonable? We can start from there. So the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.800
premise is like my org, we don't use data. We don't believe in data. How do we turn the corner?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.320
We have I know an executive mandate from now on this org is data driven and then it's just done.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.360
Right. By definition. Yeah, that's it. Okay. So all you got to do everybody. Yep. We'll be back.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.830
We're going to keep going. So one of the challenges people have by first and foremost,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:56.340
they don't know what it means. There may not be buy off. There may not be data. You may have a culture

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.580
of where I find pure intuition riddled. You'll find executives or program management.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.740
They're all sort of Steve Jobs people just asked them.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:19.520
So these are sort of the challenges that people in this arena are facing.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.320
And as a side note, because this show is not a show without tangents to give you the name later,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.320
but I was in a meeting once with a a manager who is known in circles for not being particularly

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:40.990
awesome. And he I had to bite my tongue because he pulled out the to make his argument. His point was

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.790
to make it to prove that his point was right because it's what Steve Jobs would do.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.700
Which deck of geeky I'm awesomeness playing cards you have you pull out the

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.780
that's what Steve Jobs would do discussion over. Yeah, there's an equivalent one that I've

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.980
never encountered that blatant of the card being played, but I've encountered similar ones, right?

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:21.250
Like there's a rule in these type of meetings and it's generally I'm making up numbers,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.170
keeping the number theme alive, but generally the first person in a debated meeting

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.020
that claims guys, we need to do the right thing for the customer.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.330
The first person to do that is already winning the argument.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.540
Everyone else gets on the defense. So it's like the Trump card that wins all the intuition battles.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.590
You know what, Brent? Yeah, screw the rest of the episode. Let's make let's make ourselves

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.150
a engineering game. It's like a card game or like a magic thing, but instead of like the stuff I

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.390
don't understand, we have cards like but that's what Steve Jobs do. What would the customer do?

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.750
Oh, plus five. We'll figure out the rules later, but there's there's something lurking there.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.860
I haven't played card games in a long time, but this sort like magic the gathering. I used to be

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.100
all about my I know nothing about it, but a big game player board games, card games,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.700
etc. And I'm thinking like the goal is to ship the product and or is the goal to have the

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.700
customers like it? You decide. I don't know. No, the goal is to get the better review.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.500
Oh, shipping the products is entirely irrelevant. Yeah.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.420
Okay. Let's rewind the stack. As long as you can blame all the product failings on someone else

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.260
and you get the better review, it's a win.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.590
Brent. All right. Winding back.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.710
Yeah, winding back. Once upon a time, we were talking about data and moving and

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.790
moving your team culture or to use data more or something like that. Remember that?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.860
This episode? Yeah.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:12.740
Oh, yeah. So let's do that. All right. As for first time listeners, I'll go back and I'll

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.020
talk about sort of the three phases of data, data driven cultures of the team.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.700
First and foremost, there's data oblivious. Hey, we are populated with Steve Jobs. We don't need no

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.900
stinking data. It's all driven by intuition and customer feedback.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.980
Or we don't need data. I know what the customers want.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.500
Yes. That succinctly is the problem space there.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:50.420
And then you'll hear variants of this like, I have done this for the last 25,000 years.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:57.940
Therefore, I know. Absolutely. The Experience Card. In that book that I wrote, I talked about the

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.420
Hippo and I knew I didn't invent it, but I could remember I finally just figured out recently

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.140
where I found that out. Roni Kohavi came up with the term, the Hippo, the highest paid person

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.220
in the organization. Did he really?

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.380
Yeah. That's like worldwide now.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.100
It is. It is. It is. It is. And he has the first document and I

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.780
weirdly and oddly indirectly also, I was one of the first people to grab onto that because I

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.460
used it in the book not much after he talked about it. But the point is we've all been in

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:34.400
orgs. We've all been in orgs where the highest paid person in the organization, the Hippo,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.720
decides everything based on a lot of intuition because they're experienced and they know.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.760
So the wine back there is, I'm going to give a more objective reason why that is true.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:54.640
Number one, in a lot of these organizations, they don't have data. Number two, this is a guy

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:02.610
who's being paid a buttload of money to be accountable for the decisions.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.970
Absolutely true as well.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:16.640
And it can be a risk to these folks to be accountable and I'll make up a term, over empower.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.160
I think you're right. I think that's one of the biggest obstacles to moving towards a more data

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.640
driven culture is getting over that. Not entirely their fault. It's a tough thing to get over.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.960
If I was ever the Hippo in the room, I know that I'm stupid enough that I would want to use data.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.160
That's just me.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:47.470
I would as well, but for me, it would be critical to use data. The biggest issue is,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:10:00.110
again, in the market today, you don't have a lot of free time available to be wrong.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:09.150
So you really want to be able to fail fast and fail cheap so that you can quickly adapt

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:15.740
and then go into a better direction. In today's market, that's a much better way to mitigate risk.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.940
We can probably move on. I think we've beat data oblivious.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.540
I think it's pretty obvious to everyone.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:30.350
We will need to talk about how do we get that executive to buy off.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:39.070
But let's first off, to go from data oblivious to data driven, you have to have data.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.470
Yeah, exactly. Because it's interesting you brought that up that way. How do you get them to buy

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:52.690
off when every time in my career, I've had to convince an exec of some change, you use data to

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.220
show it? Right.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.620
We have a little bit of a catch-22 here.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:03.660
I have been in situations where you have to try to convince the executive or

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.340
the executive surrogate, which is often a challenge,

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:20.830
right, to invest in the data where they don't have any data. And that's a challenge because it's viewed

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:27.230
as, wait a minute, I have to deploy a multi-million dollar data engineering stream and spend three

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.350
years before I even have a data point? No.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.310
You don't. But that's kind of their fear. That's their worry.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:39.390
That it's going to suck all of their budget and all of their engineering hours to have a stupid

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.730
chart. Right.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.690
But if they have the stupid chart, they can say they're data driven.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.020
All right. Yeah.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:52.220
Brent's making a face, but that was my awkward transition into what does it mean to be data

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.900
driven versus data oblivious?

00:11:54.620 --> 00:12:04.880
Data oblivious is, again, you're not relying on data. You're using beliefs and derived beliefs

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:12.080
from customer feedback. Data driven is essentially intuition validated by facts.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:21.840
You're using both of them together. You rely on the intuition, but you find ways to prove it before

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:33.230
you lock down the action plan. On the data stuff, so let's imagine, let's do the way back

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:49.440
machine and imagine we're on a product. Let's make it a non-service product. And we're black box

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.640
testers. Okay.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.180
How do we get into this game? How do we, obviously the first step is getting data.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:04.880
Where can we get data? Subjective data from customer feedback forums and from customer support?

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.460
Yes.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:12.060
We can still collect telemetry off of our application. It's just slower than with a service.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:12.940
Yes.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.300
We have bugs. Bugs are data.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.500
Bugs are data.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.100
We can measure perf and have perf data.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.260
All kinds of things we can measure and have data.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:31.890
So, if we had, so I'm going to step out. So, I was talking about black box testing.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:40.700
If we had a white box testing where we had an automation suite, we have a lot of data

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.540
potential from the output of the automation, perf test and all that.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:51.180
Stopwatch testing, that's slow. The very first thing on the black box test is you need to be

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:56.300
able to figure out how to automate your tests as well as automate your data feeds.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:02.160
Let me back up even more. Just to be clear, black box doesn't equate to manual.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.060
True.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.100
Because I have done plenty of black box automated testing in my life.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:18.770
Completely agree. From my experience though, a pure black box is a UI tester. Perhaps I'm being.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.370
All right. Maybe you should have said manual tester versus black box tester.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:30.860
So, even with manual, right? If you're a manual tester and you're on a product and your product

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:42.500
doesn't have some form of a diagnostic feed for dev, then really your product has so many things

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.020
to work on. It's probably not time to begin this journey.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.740
Sure. And to further dig in this tangent, because I think these terms get a little

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.540
confused, I can do manual white box testing.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:55.970
Yes, you can.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.850
That's code review. That's stepping through stuff in the debugger?

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:08.980
I've been in the past. I think it was last episode we talked about code generation tools.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.540
Yes, it was.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.020
It was.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:21.760
One of my first patent applications was a tool that essentially, in my view,

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:30.400
was likely the beginnings of reflection in the .NET library, where we had a UI, you pointed it to

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:37.760
a comm library and it generated a UI for that API and now you can ad hoc away on this artificial UI.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:47.440
But let's go back to, all right, so we have data, hopefully, communicated by the developers

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.880
into some sort of log feed.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:50.740
Got it.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.380
Right? Okay.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:16:01.650
So there's multiple places to get data. The other one, four test teams in particular,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:10.560
test teams that have automation. One of my most favored strategies to start getting into this game

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:17.760
is change your automation. And you change your automation to,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.280
the typical automation will perform actions and then do a validation. Generally, doing a validation

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.440
via some actions against the product itself, using the product as a deriving state.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:38.480
That validation, I recommend people to not do it against the product,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.350
but change their automation code to validate against data emitted from the product.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.700
What's the difference? You lost me a little bit. An example would be good right about now.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.580
So let's say you're doing performance cases. Okay.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.340
Okay. And you want to know page load times.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.700
Sure. Okay. So.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.100
From my non-service app, from my web app.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.180
Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be page load times.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.140
So transition times from screen one to screen two.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.100
Perfect. Okay.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.840
Just keeping you honest.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.480
Change your automation. Well, first off, your automation probably already has

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.360
automated the transition from screen one to screen two.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.240
Correct.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:32.420
The practice that I did back in the day, and I haven't been a perf tester for a long time.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.580
We're all perf testers.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.940
Was essentially you would set up a timer.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.620
You would start the timer before you perform action one.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:54.020
And then when you finally did the final action, you would wait until the load event completed,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.980
and then you would stop the timer and then you record.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.700
Then you do math.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.340
Right.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.620
You have a transition time.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:17:59.860
Right.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:09.570
What I'm saying instead is log the load times into your diagnostic feed.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.680
Using the same math?

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:12.770
No.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.730
Oh.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.170
So here it's.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.210
Oh, I see. So the.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.170
You have the developers say, so every time there's a transition,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:26.700
you have the developers log the start and end events.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.780
Okay. So that's no longer part of the test.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.620
It's part of the.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.340
The data.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.020
The application logging, the data emitted from the product called logging.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.500
Okay.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:35.740
Yes.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:42.060
Now you in your validation of your perf test.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.180
So your perf all your automation becomes load generators.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.750
That's it.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:54.990
But when you want to go and look at what was the time you have the validation part of your code.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.150
Go to the data itself and extract the time from the data.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.450
All right.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:06.210
So let me see if I compare phrase this old school was I get the tick count.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.930
I get the time I do my action.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:09.890
I wait for it to complete.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.130
I get the new time do math.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.330
Now I have the load time.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.650
I can track that in my own stuff somewhere and then I have load times old school.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.890
New school is just write the automation knowing that.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:28.370
The application logs all those times and you can use those times rather than rather

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.210
than calculate them yourself.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:30.450
Yes.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:39.600
Now in some cases you may need to leverage a hook in the application where you pass a unique ID.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:39.840
Okay.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.920
So let's back up a second.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.080
Let me just talk about what I understand as the Brent's playing genius here.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.600
I'm playing data idiot because I'm pretty good at it.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.080
So the advantage here is is now the developers on the project as I see it.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.640
Now see data generation about the product as part of what they do.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.360
Okay.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.320
Step one towards that.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:04.270
They may.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.270
I mean in some cases they'll go what just do it in your automation.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:09.650
Right.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:18.780
So the way I've done this in the past is I've essentially taken my guys and they've

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:26.540
changed that instrumentation because a lot of dev it can be very reluctant and resistant to adding

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:35.010
additional instrumentation that that isn't inherently useful to them up front.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.920
They're like wait I got to add all of this code to the product when you could just do it inside

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.120
your automation without me.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:43.360
Okay.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.080
Right.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.960
What's an example of a place where the developer may have actually have an answer for this.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.280
Okay.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.600
I think we're a developer would also want to add logging in addition to performance.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.560
What's another place where.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.410
Logging like air conditions.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:57.810
Sure.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.410
That's what I was saying obviously.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:03.730
Yeah.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.330
I'm driving but driving a blank.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.090
No I think I think it's actually a good example.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.370
I think if you think about any of the things that traditionally gathered for web

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:17.490
apps and services via telemetry a lot of that you want to of course avoid the coverage.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.090
You don't want to log everything under the sun.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.970
Now on line 10 now on line 11 now on line 12.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:26.130
No.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:32.210
No but I have seen teams go over the top logging too much like I'm in this function.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.010
I'm calling this function.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:33.730
I'm back from this function.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.610
I'm exiting this function maybe over the top.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:42.770
Yeah but there are if there's things you want to know about how the customers use the product

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:43.490
you can log this.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:49.650
Yes the key secret here for lack of a better word is number one.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.770
If you're a tester and you're trying to get into this game like the first thing

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.900
adapt what you already are a master of.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.980
So you already know how to drive the product.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.180
You already know how to test.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.700
You already know how to find bugs.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:13.730
But now what I'm suggesting is find bugs via the data being emitted from the product.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:24.020
So if your dev has log streams master the art of using those diagnostic streams to find bugs.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:37.390
Okay change your automation to use that same data feed to generate true false on your test passes.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:45.070
So that is interesting because one of the most difficult things in automation to do is the Oracle.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.470
Yep.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:51.550
I've done action A and action B and now C should happen but often verifying C is very very difficult.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:59.340
You just do action A action B action D action F and then analyze the log files to see where

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.980
the errors may have occurred or if things worked as expected.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.620
Yes.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.340
So I have a calculator app.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.540
I'm going to put right on the spot here.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.820
I enter two plus two equals.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.790
Do I verify that four shows up in the output or do I just count on the logs to verify that's

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.190
correct.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.740
I would count on the logs.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:24.850
You could.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:33.840
I mean that that's going to cause some consternation because hey well it's entirely possible

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.200
that they write four in the log and write five in the UI.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.770
Right.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:52.560
It is and that's something that this is a shortcut that I recommend taking because the data stuff is

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.440
far more valuable.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.740
But that UI validation leave it to the dev.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:05.260
If if again if you are on my my view is if your dev team is

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:16.400
moronic enough such that the there is a actually a possibility that what shows up in the log

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.400
file is different than what's in the UI.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.240
You have bigger problems and that's at least another two episodes of it.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.480
I think it's a little bit of a trust but verify because you're going to have it's not like you're

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.600
good just like automation isn't going to eliminate the needs for humans to look at a product with

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.240
the UI.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.760
You're still going to need to look at it.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.000
Yep.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.920
Like why did all these actions and the logs don't tell me the screen turned pink.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.960
That's okay.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.760
You're not going to release this without at least looking at it and and furthermore

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.200
doing some actual testing on it.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:50.270
Right.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:58.620
And then if you do find that hey I'm in calculator and I add two plus two and it comes out to five

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:05.100
logs as four you're going to notice and you're going to root cause figure out who is being an

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.380
idiot developer on the team.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:14.560
There will be there will be another process right an easy mitigation for that is you you build up

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.720
your your suite based off of using the logs.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:25.280
You create an adapter to your automation that could actually drive it from the UI and then you

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.760
infrequently run that UI only pass as a validation to make sure that the logs and the UI agree.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:39.760
I would never do that because I would simply go to the dev team and say look guys if that's

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.600
something that I need to worry about then I want my test team involved in every one of your code

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:52.080
reviews because you're just telling me that your concerns around the quality of your craftsmanship

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.160
are so low that I need to pay attention to even comments.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:04.000
All right so in a nutshell one step towards data driven is to move the Oracle to the output

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.200
emitted from the product versus something you try and do in your test.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.920
Yes and the reason why we're doing that is number one people already find value

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.400
in results of test passes and finding bugs.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.960
All we're doing is we're making a change in the system to get that value from a data feed.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.200
Now the nice thing we were talking about sort of an on-prem product but the nice thing is

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.910
you build this asset on a service product say on pre-prod.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:43.360
Now once this bad boy goes live now you've already built up a facility

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:52.980
to use the data from customer generated actions to prove true and false on your on your tests.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.060
Yeah if you can pull this stuff off on a desktop app.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.960
Many parts of it get much much easier when you're doing a distributed app, service app.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:10.290
Yeah and if even if it is a even if it is a desktop app right if if you as long as you have

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:19.180
some form of a log shipping mechanism once this thing goes live you've already garnered

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:25.520
the skills around processing customer-derived telemetry.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.440
Sure right you may not have all of your test suite because you know the the instrumentation

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.290
costs can become expensive as it relates to CPU processing.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:42.900
And one thing I actually don't know enough about Mac and Linux to know I assume they have

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:49.540
equivalents built into the system but on Windows you have ETW tracing which it's don't brag a lot

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:56.780
about Microsoft but one thing I'll mention it it's a nice it's a nice logging mechanism with

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:03.180
APIs that is very performance non-intrusive. A lot of devs will worry about if I'm gonna write

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.940
to disk all the time our app is gonna slow way down. Right so you want to that may be something

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.820
you have to consider and look for mechanisms either open source or built in the operating

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.700
system that allow you to do a lot more extensive logging and then you're probably doing now

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:24.540
without an impact on performance. There is a challenge so I do know this there's a challenge

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:34.910
with Apple they have very hard to consume APIs to get to think like the equivalent of a crash

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:46.690
dump information. Not surprisingly Apple kind of runs their OS like like they do many of their products

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:52.530
as a as a walled garden like there's there's act there's places that you're allowed to access

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:58.050
in this places you're not allowed to access and a lot of the interesting information is in the places

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:05.970
that you're not allowed to access. Linux I haven't had any direct experience with Linux but I got to

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:14.610
imagine like Linux being an open source platform I got to assume that they're probably easier than

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:22.130
Microsoft on on getting this type of information. Yeah just trying to address a potential feedback

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:27.010
bit of feedback you might get like we can't log everything but there are ways to do it that are

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:35.570
going to be non-performance intrusive. And you don't need to log everything but

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:43.170
these making this move will be logging a lot more than they have before. They will and as they gain

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:52.940
success they'll also gain knowledge around what information is useful to log to really move things

00:29:52.940 --> 00:30:00.780
forward. Right. So what else does it take to be data driven? So that's that's a I love that I'm going

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:08.910
to use that what else what what else makes me data driven? So what we've really done here is we just

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:17.890
got we got the test team starting to use the data okay for work and value propositions that

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:26.420
they're already accustomed to. Is that enough for us to get executive buy-off now? No. No not at all.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:38.380
No but what we've done is we've got the testing getting used to the data okay and we've now

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:53.020
mastered using the the the data for our test pass work to derive customer behaviors in a in a very

00:30:53.020 --> 00:31:01.140
high level way right. As we just discussed that this thing goes out to the world we now can look

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:07.780
at the data feed and go oh this is what customers are actually doing on the product okay.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:18.290
In the limited scope as it relates to what we've done to support the the test cases right. Now what

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:29.520
we need to do is convert that into new value propositions. I want to talk about my North Star

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:36.610
so I'm going to go way to the data centricity thing because it is I think it's useful to say

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:44.510
instead of as we walk you know step by step along this path where the hell are we going

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:53.020
and the rallying cry that I use for my team is essentially deliver the right knowledge at the

00:31:53.020 --> 00:32:00.800
right time to the right people that accelerates actionable and valuable decision making.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:07.120
Okay so the first thing that we've done is we started using the data the the first step

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:17.170
towards that adriven is create visibility where none exists. So we've created a brief element of

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:30.080
visibility around customer utility. Okay next thing we need to really focus on the next two things is

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:39.310
using that data in a much more frequent fashion to drive actionability. So now we've been using

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:49.870
it to validate the test passes. Yes you can ship no you can't okay. Now we need to go we need to take

00:32:49.870 --> 00:33:00.450
this data and use it to drive decisions on the product. I'll give you an example of something that

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:06.050
that I did when I was in the early phases of this. This was during my time in Xbox.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:14.930
Okay I am. Brett and I overlapped in Xbox for about a month? Two? Maybe two weeks it was really.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.410
First first thing when I got there I said this guy's got to go.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:32.000
And it was positive that I was already on my way. Yes yeah um yeah so from Xbox I went to to Bing

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.850
but in Xbox one of the things that I did there was held my own against the PMs in terms of their

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:46.690
intuition. There was this one app that we were doing for the Kinect. No longer remember the name

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:56.670
but it was intended for essentially teen literally the target audience was teenage girls and the

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:06.750
belief was teenage girls would like to use Kinect and Xbox so that their avatars could chat with each

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:15.790
other. So it would be like you and I going into a chat room. Yeah and I wish I could translate

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:31.500
a face palm into a podcast comment. Do it harder Brett. Now what I started doing so

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:40.300
I didn't own this but I hated it. I thought it was completely stupid so I started asking precision

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:51.100
questions and getting data. So this was at at the beginning phases. I was one of the first people

00:34:51.100 --> 00:35:00.860
on the the Xbox team to use the Microsoft big data store. Xbox had been emitting data to this

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:07.820
big store forever. Cosmos. Yeah yeah. But I was one of the first people to actually use it. What

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:14.940
Dev had been doing was just stuffing data. PM had been adding sections to their spec that says this

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:22.780
is the data that must be instrumented. Checkbox development. But no one actually had any plans to

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:28.400
use it. So I was one of the first people there. So is there a step now between data oblivious and

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:35.600
data driven. It sounds like there is an interim step data aware. I guess so. I'm just going to add

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.480
that my model. It's like we're not oblivious like we know there's data. We don't do anything with it

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:47.920
but we we know about it. Right. Oh yeah. Yeah. We have data look. It's all instrumented. Terabytes

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.760
of it. Yeah. What do we do with it. We don't look at it. Oh god. That's too much. Yeah actually and

00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:00.800
that was part of the problem because it was too much. So we had. Let me not go into that. Sorry.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:13.550
Anyway so I I looked at once we started going to beta. I looked at the data around who's using it.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:20.510
I spent I looked at the org chart of the team that was developing it

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:34.240
and came up with a rough heuristic around cost. And I basically showed that this is stupid.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:44.640
We were paying a huge amount of money not counting the technical the the technical assets we had to

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.640
pull the bear when we shipped this on life site because we're talking about

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:58.800
these constant data streams. But essentially we were paying just a crap load of money per launch.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:05.700
So someone launching the app how much did how much did we pay every time they launched the app.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:13.200
I did some basic research. I really didn't understand data like I do today. Like today

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.080
if I were to go after this it would be a much different story. A bloodbath right. Yeah.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.720
But but I was trying to then go OK well what are we going to gain from this.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:32.000
Right fine. We pay a large amount of money per each launch. But that's going to.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:39.900
So when everybody who launches this what are they more likely to buy from us later to. Obviously

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:47.660
the app isn't going to convert into profit. What will. Nothing. I went and talked to the team and

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:54.220
it was it was from the executive down. So your intuition said this was a bad idea. So you use

00:37:54.220 --> 00:38:01.520
data to go help prove that point. Right. He ultimately ended up shipping it and then about

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.400
three months later removing it from the product for the card game we're developing. Yep. There's

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.480
an I told you so card that you can play at this point. I told you it would fail.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:18.770
I would. I would play the fail faster next time card. That would be my equivalent of that one.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:25.490
Sure. Now. So if we want to get the right information at the right time for action

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:30.690
ability. Now what we need to do is think about what does. So let's talk about buy off. Let's

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:35.730
spend the rest of the time talking about how do we get executives buy off. We have not the whole

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:42.880
rest of the time because I want to get more into what's beyond data driven data centric data centric.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.570
This probably another podcast. We only have 10 minutes left.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:55.010
But how do you get by off. So I'm getting data. You're getting data. I'm getting some insights.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:39:00.050
I feel like hey this is I'm getting the hang of this a little bit. Now how do I get buy off to

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:08.670
go even farther from the higher ups who may be leery of what I'm doing. Because damn it

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:14.510
Brent. I just want a red yellow green test pass result and I'll make my ship decision

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:19.600
based on that. That's enough. You don't. That was my point here at boss.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.560
So that's what bosses are accustomed to. Let me ask you Alan. Brent. Where do.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:39.250
New ideas come from other ideas. How they meet and they fester together.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:44.290
They coagulate and they have they sometimes they love each other very much and they make

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:51.810
new ideas together. So when two ideas really love each other. Yeah. All right. So let me give you

00:39:51.810 --> 00:40:04.830
a new way of viewing the the data science buzzword insight. OK. An insight is an idea buried in data.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:14.540
So where do new insights come from data getting together making making making new insight

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:21.020
babies making data babies. Right now. So what you have to be able to do is take the data

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:27.820
and connect it to something that's valuable to the executive. So an executive says if you can sit

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:39.300
down how do you get by off. You go. Hey look at the success we've had improving the the automation

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:47.900
the proving the accuracy by leveraging this data. And we did this data investment because now we have

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:57.260
visibility to how the product works in a customer reality much better than we've ever done before.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:05.820
Executives will have an intuition view based off of their customer segments. The way I have done

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:14.030
this in the past is that you can get the executive to give you a clue around their business KPIs

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:19.790
around how they want to how they're trying to sell this to customers how they're trying to grow

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:32.190
usage. What are the key goals in his review. These are these are the things that they're

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:38.750
thinking about when they lock down control around how they want the product to function.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:48.350
What you need to do your ultimate goal is to say hey I can help reduce your risk and increase

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:58.740
your speed towards your goals and you start small. Before you go and present that to an executive

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:07.860
you need to figure out a way and honestly you may need to do this via the dark matter factory. It's

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:15.070
a term a buddy of mine uses up meaning I just do it and I go dark and I don't tell anyone.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:23.260
Okay right because if you have to articulate if you have to argue the biggest challenge with

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:30.300
getting an exec buy off is you're asking them to make an investment and take a risk on something

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:36.140
that no one in the organization knows or understands and no executive I have ever met will ever do

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:49.090
that. To me if you have to show it's less risky. Yeah and honestly if you've done it right up to

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:55.330
this point if you've got enough if you're at the point where you have data permitted from the

00:42:55.330 --> 00:43:02.480
product showing that you can get insights. Yep. And you can get the wheels turning on that exec just

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.680
a little bit like so. So what's something you want to know about what's important to you. What do

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.520
you want to know about the product. They're going to go. Well I want to know blah and blah and

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:17.740
blah or A and B and C. We can measure those through data. Let me show you how and then

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:25.300
we talked. I'm going to show it to Keeler for me the second here. We've talked about this before

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:32.350
but I think insights are addictive and the moment you get someone spinning going I can use

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:38.110
an insight data idea buried in an idea buried in data. Is that right. Yep. So once I have one of

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:44.750
those it's like oh I want another. So if you can just get them hooked a little bit and which

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:48.670
again if you've gotten to the point where you have enough to prove to them

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:56.690
I think hooking unless they're actually the pointy here boss from Dilbert is not a stretch.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:05.920
And once you get them hooked you got them on your side. You need all you need is so unfortunately

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.760
this is context sensitive. So every executive and every business has their own different

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:20.340
set of KPIs that they worry about. Yeah. You set up and say hey I want to try something. It's nothing

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:27.700
you need to worry about. I'll figure out how to fund it. None of the plan will be at risk. But

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:33.650
tell me as it relates to the product what is your top of mind. What keeps you up at night. What

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:40.210
are you worried about. OK. It could be I don't have enough developers. Do I have the right features.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:45.090
Am I going to make enough money. Whatever. OK. Hey I can't go fast enough.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:55.280
Generally you can apply this data or the data in some way towards the goal that he's looking for.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:05.060
All you need is one of two things from the data which again by now you've you've learned to use

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:12.380
because you've you've changed your tooling to live off of it. You need data that shows

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:23.520
he's making a big risk or she or you need data that says hey wait a minute. There is this huge

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:29.120
opportunity that the data is showing that we're not taking advantage of. And I find these things

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:39.730
are easy. Right in my office right now I am probably 75 percent the way through a data insight.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:47.090
It's one of my favorite things to do is show the executive team that the product does not

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:56.850
work the way they think it does with data. And every time I have done that the business has

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:09.380
changed. There are often really simple insights that that people beliefs. Let's go with that one.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:15.700
There are often common beliefs. Sorry. Common beliefs within a team. So when you're in a data

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:21.620
oblivious there's intuition going running rampant. Right. You've got the Steve Jobs character at

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:28.100
the top saying this is what our customers want and you have developers generally marching to

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:38.750
that drum because they let's say it's positively the distrust that the PM knows their stuff.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:51.740
So pick one of these beliefs that you personally find likely wrong.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:59.860
Or right. Or right. I find actually I'm going to take that back. That you find likely wrong.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:07.860
Because one of the things that tests are very good at is investigating wrong.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:15.310
Investigating broken. So leverage that as a strength. Then go through and see if you can

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:23.070
prove or disprove. Now here like the key principles number one we talked about the very first thing

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:30.270
you're trying to do is make the invisible visible. You then need to drive action off of that

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:36.740
and you also need to target interesting. Okay. And the interesting is what you're going to

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:41.620
target is those things that we just talked about that the executive is going to find interesting.

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:48.660
You're looking for things that will cause the executive to realize that he's taking a risk

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:57.060
or that there is a better opportunity. Either one of those good. As you've mastered that you're

00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:03.660
going to want to speed it up and simplify it. They make it so that they don't need you. But

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:12.690
that's more of the data driven to data centric transformation. But truth is probably the hardest

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:18.300
part of this. How do you make sure you're telling the truth. Even though it may not be the truth

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:26.060
people want to hear. At these beginning phases making sure that you're telling the truth and

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:32.860
not so coming even to your own subjective bias. Right. Hey PM says this I believe this I went in

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:40.190
the data and unbeknownst to you you did what's known as confirmation bias. You proved you were

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:47.440
right. And you did it in a way by only loading in the sample set that proves you're right. Right.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.400
As you go through this journey developing truth as a key principle is critical because

00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:02.800
that's how you eventually win on this on this data culture shift and build trust.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:11.840
Okay cool. And that about wraps the A B testing episode on becoming data driven in almost data

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:18.300
centric. We'll get that next time. That correct. Yes. All right. Hey everybody. Thank you very much

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:23.340
for listening. I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we'll see you next time. Bye.
