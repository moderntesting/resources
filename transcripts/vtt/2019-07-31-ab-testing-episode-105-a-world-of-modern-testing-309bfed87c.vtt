00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.780
The Modern Testing Podcast. Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.680
I am mindless agile robot. I must iterate.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.680
As we talk about software engineering, software quality, leadership, and whatever else comes to mind.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.680
Now on with the show.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.680
Hello again, Brent. Howdy, Alan. It's good to see you again.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.680
It's good to be seen by you.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.680
We're on the summer schedule of A-B testing recording where we don't record as often because crap is going on.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.680
Oh my god, speaking of crap. Oh, what episode are we running?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680
105.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680
105? That's a cool number.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.680
Speaking of numbers.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680
Is it?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
The number of my house address is changing.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.680
I saw that on...

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
I'm freaking moving. Oh my god.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680
And you got a killer stove.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.680
Did you see that?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.680
I did.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.680
That's like a $3,000 stove top in this new place.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680
So, wasn't planning to move.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.680
Wasn't looking to move.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
Had a company picnic a weekend before last.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
Driving back...

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.680
I think there's some houses over here.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.680
Maybe there's some...

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.680
Let's just drive over here by this neighborhood.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.680
My kids really wanted to live close to their high school.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.680
They're both in the same high school next year.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
And so we drove...

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.680
Oh, hey look.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.680
This house is open house tomorrow.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Maybe we'll come back.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680
Oh look, there's a realtor there.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.680
Oh, she's going to let us in.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.680
Oh, we look around going, you know what?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.680
Let's move.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.680
So, over email, we negotiate an offer.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.680
And buying a house now versus 11 years ago about the last house.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680
Only 11 years.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.710
It's like all of...

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
Like the entire negotiation, email and texting.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.030
The loan application.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.030
I call my loan guy.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.030
He's forever.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.030
He's great.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.030
And get everything taken care of over email and maybe two phone calls.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.030
All the real estate documents, all online digital.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.030
It's fantastic.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.030
It goes super fast.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.030
The house is nice.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.030
We'll close probably early.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.030
We'll probably close in less than 30 days from we made the offer.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.030
But all that streamlined stuff.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.030
Title companies.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.030
The people that do like...

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.030
The one where you go and you spend eight hours just putting your initials on hundreds of documents.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.030
They like traditional testing in many ways.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.030
They embraced 1990 like it's nobody's business.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.640
It's like one quick story and then we'll go on to even less random stories.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.640
They sent me a whole bunch of docs in a random order with weird names and they forgot the names.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640
And I signed...

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640
One was a two page thing.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640
Only need signatures on the second page.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.640
So, I printed out that page, signed it, sent it back.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.220
And they said, hey, I need both pages of that thing.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.220
I said, only one page needed signatures.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.220
Do you want me to send back the page you sent me as is?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.630
The answer?

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.630
Yes, please.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.800
It's like, oh my...

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800
It's like I...

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.800
My whole thing is I abhor inefficiency.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.800
I want things to be easy and streamlined and straightforward and that made me mad.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.800
But the bureaucrats, Alan, are protecting us from making mistakes.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800
Oh, shush.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.800
If you hadn't sent back that first page, you were at risk.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.800
Ten years from now, someone would have done a challenge to your title and you'd be out on living in cardboard boxes.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.570
I'm curious to see when I edit this later how much thumping comes out from Brent fondling the microphone, but we'll see.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.600
So, I want to do a quick...

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
And you get new sexy microphones today.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600
Self-advertisements.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.600
I've been working on recording with this exact same microphones in our new recorder here.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600
We'll see how it goes.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.050
We should make remote recording easier when we get back to that.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.050
I think I've mentioned on the podcast, if not, surprise.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.050
I'm working on a modern testing course for Ministry of Testing.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.530
I am very excited about it.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.530
I want to say I'm a third of the way done, but I'm way more than a third of the way done.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.560
I've done all the planning.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.560
Everything's all figured out what's in each session.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.560
I've recorded the first three.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.560
There's an intro, which is sort of the hook on why modern testing isn't as boring and stupid as you think it is.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.660
I phrase it much better in the video.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.660
I don't think it's boring or stupid.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.660
And then I know.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.660
And then I've recorded the first episode each on the first two principles.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.660
I'm going to do one episode, one course, whatever they're called, per principle, and then a wrap up at the end.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.660
So a total of nine episodes.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.660
They're all five to seven minutes.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.660
So it's enough to, which I guess would be a 45 minute talk if you watched them all at once,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.660
which is about right for kind of getting a good overview.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.660
But then we'll have lots of discussion with the people that take the course on the dojo.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.660
I think it's going to be pretty cool.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.660
I don't understand how it's a course.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.660
Can you explain those details?

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.660
Like nine, seven minute things.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.660
Those feel more like YouTube nuggets.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.660
Remember, we're talking to the YouTube generation.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.660
So if you join the Ministry of Testing, if you join the Ministry of Testing, you join the dojo,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.660
you have access to all the courses they have online.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.660
And they are a whole bunch of these things.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:46.690
And the idea is within these courses, I have within each class, each section of the course,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.690
there are one or two or three places where I ask the viewer to pause and reflect or answer some questions

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.690
or do a little bit of exercises to help reinforce what we're talking about.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.690
For example, in principle number two episode, accelerating the team,

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.690
there's a reflection exercise where I ask them to list the things they're doing that help speed the team up.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.690
And the things they're doing that help that are slowing things on their team that are slowing them down.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.690
Just so they start thinking about those.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.690
So there's things like that.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:26.690
In the first course of this series, the intro, I give them your very first glance for some people at the modern testing principles.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.690
I'll just ask them to take some time before they go any farther to think about which ones are which ones like yeah,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.690
yeah, yeah, head nod, head nod, which ones they go.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.690
I'm going to skip to that right now.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.690
See if I want to go any farther.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.100
That kind of stuff.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.100
So I'm pretty excited.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.100
I will.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.100
So I'm trying to wrap up this course.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:52.100
The folks at Ministry of Test being very patient with me because I'm behind in getting them things and I'm moving at the same time.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:07:00.100
And the day job, which will be able to talk about a little bit later, is a bit on the busy side.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.100
Now I'll get into that later.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:11.100
But the cool thing is in modern testing, in this course, in doing this course and then watching what's going on,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:22.520
we are seeing and this is the very subtle transition to something more like a podcast than the previous 10 minutes is we're seeing,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:31.610
Brent and I are both seeing more and more people and teams doing things that are a lot more like modern testing.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:42.750
And it's what's the word I'm thinking of how it's awesome, exciting, a little scary, like what if we're wrong?

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.750
We're not, but we've let the world astray.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.750
No, no, no.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.750
If we're wrong, then there's a whole bunch of.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.750
Then I don't want to be right.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:59.750
Then there's a whole bunch of giants whose shoulders we're standing on who are also wrong.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.750
So we won't be alone.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:14.820
But the thing is the chances of that are if this is something that we didn't have any direct experience on, I'd be worried.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.460
But we do.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.460
It works.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.580
And for now, it's right.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.220
Yeah, we had I won't name any names, but I want to.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:34.220
But one listener who I hope and I hope gets the job.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.220
But they in their interview, they had their interviewer pull up the modern testing principles.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.760
Yeah, which is which is awesome.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.760
I was going to say brave or I'll go with brave.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.400
I don't the way the way they describe the scenario.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400
I'm not so certain.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400
Right.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:01.400
I don't know that I don't remember the details of what they mentioned, but this is a company that didn't have a QA.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.400
They were apparently struggling.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.400
They looking to hire one person.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:17.560
They knew up front the company, the hiring manager knew up front that they were under heat because QA had a reputation already.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.560
That company of slowing things down.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.560
And that was something they didn't want.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:31.910
And this listener just immediately went and was like, oh, fantastic.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.910
We're aligned here.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.910
Let me show you modern testing principles.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.910
This is whether or not you hire me.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.910
This is what you need to do.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.190
Very cool.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.190
I was talking to someone.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.290
I think it was.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:56.450
I think it was Melissa Eden, who is one of the three for sure.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:10.450
Just gave a talk recently on modern testing, which is the which is kind of cool to see people besides us more and more also talking about this thing called modern testing and in turn taking some of the heat for us, which is pretty cool.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.930
Oh, I didn't hear that story.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.410
No, I mean, not about her taking heat.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.410
I haven't heard any stories about that, but she's talking about modern testing.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:31.410
And I mentioned to her that like when I first I didn't know what to make of the first talk ever on modern testing external, which was at test bash year before last in Brighton.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:39.630
Test bash Brighton because there's 18,000 test bashes a year and a couple of cool things about that talk.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:48.660
One, the coolest thing was afterwards how many people told me, thank you for giving a name to what we're already doing or I want to do that.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.660
We just we're not ready, but I want to do that.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.660
And I was expecting more, much more hate.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.660
I thought it would be much more controversial instead of inspiring.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:05.660
And if I can manage to inspire or lead or provide any sort of value, I feel pretty damn good about what I provided.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.660
So I'm excited there.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:17.920
But the other thing I'm excited about with the with that talk was when they scheduled it, they asked me if I do the after lunch slot.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.920
I said, you need to you need to we need some of your colorful language.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.920
Maybe they said I didn't want to wake up the crowd, wake up the crowd, which I do and did.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.920
And in doing so, apparently not the last now because people have taken my lead.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.920
But at the time I earned the first ever explicit tag for a Ministry of Test recording.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.920
I didn't plan it.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920
It just kind of came out that way.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.920
I was excited.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.950
These things happen leading into and you can help me.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.950
Let's brainstorm on this a bit.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.950
Fact.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.230
I'm channeling Dwight Schrute from the office.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.230
Fact.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.160
We're seeing more people do things like modern testing.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.380
Fact.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.420
Many of them, including myself, are in roles that don't have testing in the title.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.420
Fact.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.740
I am speaking at Auradev in November.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:14.740
Haven't started working on the talk yet because they have to scrape the information because what I want to talk about the topic.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.740
Wait fact.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.740
My topic is talking about what people do.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.740
You don't watch the office going, Alan, what the.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.740
What the are you talking about?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:32.220
I want to tell stories of how people are living in this modern testing world.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:41.220
So I'll need to track some people down, probably via Zoom calls, potentially to be recorded.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.220
Guests on our podcast.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:49.220
But over the next few months, I want to start tracking down and talking to a lot of these people who are doing things that are modern test.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:54.220
We had a listener and Brent is never going to get a word in because I have all these ideas on my head.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.220
We haven't talked for a month and he gave me coffee.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.220
We had a listener who works at a bank on their mobile app.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:07.220
So it's not like oh, who is also got Brad all excited.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.220
Is this the one in Germany?

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.220
Yes. Yes.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.220
This is fantastical, which is not German.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.220
No, it's not.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.220
And I'll let you talk about that in a minute.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.220
But the idea is I want to collect all these stories.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.410
No, this is really, really happening, which is amazing.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.410
And people were and to be clear, this is happening and would have happened without us.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:39.410
What we've provided is a framework to talk about it, some common language, a way to a place to point and say, yes, that's what I'm doing.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.410
And so that's the value we provide.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.410
We haven't.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.410
I don't think we've caused people to go.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.410
Well, in most cases, at least to go.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.410
This is the way I want to do it.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.410
People are going, oh, this is what I do.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.410
I have a way to talk about it.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:58.410
But I want to tell those stories to the folks at Oradev who may or may not get what this whole idea is about.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.410
So I've been thinking a great deal around what did we do.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:09.410
Right. Because we stole a lot of the modern testing principles from book here, book there, book everywhere.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:16.410
The lucky thing is we read all the same books between Flo and the lean startup and a few other things.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.410
The principles emerged fairly easily.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.410
And we both executed.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:27.050
But I've been thinking about what is our product.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.300
Right. And is it ours or not.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:40.820
Right. And what I realized is what we've done is we've constructed a rallying point.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:51.820
These thoughts were out there, but we gave them a place to converge and grow and be healthy.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:59.670
And that's what I think we've done.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.670
Yeah. I am a firm believer in the rallying cry.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:09.670
And that's which is a big thing of Palantioni's work is business novels.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:15.670
And I think, yeah, we provided that probably not just subconsciously.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:26.630
I'm looking forward to I think the next step is when it takes on a life of its own that we couldn't control even if we wanted to.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:37.820
And don't you think if with people pulling it out in interviews and people giving talks about it that aren't you and I that maybe it's on its way there?

00:15:37.820 --> 00:16:01.390
No. What I'm thinking is the next step is when someone does something like realizes we have a an open source license on it and they go create their own modern testing dot something reference it and start moving on their own.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.650
Now, I think just you by saying that that may happen.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:09.650
And to be clear, the modern testing principles are free to do whatever you want with attribution.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.650
You can you can make a whole product around them.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:22.650
Oh, that's when we know we've lost when some tool vendor talks about their ability to accelerate their team using modern testing tool.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.650
There is one thing we need to do though.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:31.710
And that is we need to modify that license to ensure certain things never happen.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:36.710
For example, I do not ever want to see a certification course for modern testing.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.710
Oh, yeah. Let's have this.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:46.710
Actually, spoiler alert coming out next year is the modern tester certification black belt.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.710
No, just kidding.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.710
Yeah.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.710
No.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.030
There's there's nothing right now.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.130
I mean, maybe you and I should talk off.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.130
Okay.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:10.860
There's a lot of risk with our current where we are with how it's going viral and and how open the licenses.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:21.930
Did you want to talk any more about some of the things that you've seen in our slack or elsewhere on people adopting things that are like our modern testing?

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.930
Well, you brought up the earlier example.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:40.600
One of our listeners, I'm getting to a point where so one of the things I like to do on the select channel, as you know, is when a new person comes in, I like to give them a free taco.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.600
Okay. And you only these are these are virtual tacos.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.600
They're virtual tacos.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.600
But they're tacos and they're awesome.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.820
And every person only gets five per five per day to give away.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:18:00.820
And by the way, shout out the hey taco for helping us out with our hey taco license and keeping us going with tacos on one of the three dot slack dot com.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.820
Yeah, they were fantastic on that.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:09.300
And Alan was fantastic on getting them to agree to that.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:17.300
But I'm I do think perhaps even sometime this year that there will be time where I cannot give out.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.370
I only have five a day a day.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.370
Right. I can't give out all five or I need more than five.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.530
Sorry, I can because people are coming in.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.530
I love hearing when they when they join the community.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.530
I get it. If more than five people join in a day, you run out of tacos.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.530
Right.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.530
Just connecting the dots for everyone.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:40.530
Sorry.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.530
No, I'm good. I'm good.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.530
I'm good.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:49.350
Words working not in a love here in their stories.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.350
Yes. Yes.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.350
There was a there was a new listener that came in.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:19:03.090
They are applying again MTP like practices.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:18.090
But they they're a German company and they're a bank, which is a highly regulated industry in a country who adores regulations.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:31.090
And so seeing these companies break through what we've been told when we started doing modern testing is oh, you can't do that because of this bureaucracy or that issue.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:36.090
For example, we only do client products on prem.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.410
People are pushing the boundary.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:51.720
And I love that the Slack channel is a place where those who are interested are learning how to from each other now.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.720
Things are really picking up.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.750
Yeah, I think so.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:06.750
And including and we probably don't have enough time to go into it today, but including as things get pick up.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:18.100
Right. The the opinion leaders on the other side are going to start being more visible, more out there and more directly against these concepts.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.810
The 80 haters.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.810
Yeah.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.810
Probably worth mentioning.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.810
We'll go too deep into it.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:26.810
But we do.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:36.810
We aren't without our controversy with aren't without those who think what we're doing is harmful to the business or worse harmful to the craft.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.160
Remember, modern testing isn't about testing and it's not really that modern.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.160
That's our that's our tagline to add somewhere.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.160
It's about accelerating the team.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.160
It's about building software.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:59.160
It's about it's about helping the team build a sustainable and profitable business or successful business, I should say, because it modern testing works in nonprofits as well.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.380
In some regards, though, I'll just speak out.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:08.380
I do think depending on the context, I think in some regards, it is harmful to the craft.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.830
Right.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.830
Not the testing activity, but the tech testing discipline.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:21.830
And when I hear people say it's harmful to the craft, sometimes they're it's overlooked.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:28.990
Right. Sometimes they're saying, hey, you're going to encourage businesses to ship shit out in the wild.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:38.990
And sometimes they're saying, hey, you're adding adding fuel to the fire towards the direction of removing the discipline.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.990
That latter one, I absolutely could see.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:57.470
We're not telling people what to do or what not to do, but we are saying it is a whole team effort and you need to do the right thing regardless of fear.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:03.260
Yeah. Yeah. Let's transition to make this about me.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.260
OK.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:10.260
I want to talk a little bit about what I'm doing in the postmodern world, if we want to call it that or the modern world.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.260
I don't think it's a postmodern. I think you're post traditional.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:19.260
Post traditional. Post traditional world in my non test, but kind of quality role.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.390
I have a weekly meeting.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.390
There's a lot of all kinds of weekly meetings.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:37.620
One meeting in particular, I was meeting with marketing and a product manager and my boss and his boss to go over one of the projects a little bit more.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.620
One of the new things, a little more interesting, a little more risky.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.620
So just kind of a check in.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.870
We were talking about and I'm asking you about this.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:56.940
We had a good discussion on the difference between what's the difference in products, Brent, between testing and validation.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.220
And these could be terms that are that maybe I just use.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.220
So I want to ask you this before I go on.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.740
But do those terms mean anything different to you?

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:12.700
In my text on me, testing is the super set.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:20.530
Testing is the if I were to break it down, testing is an activity.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:24.530
Validation is one key aspect that you're doing.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:31.530
Another key aspect would be ad hoc or exploratory testing.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:40.460
Validation in the vernacular I used to use is essentially, hey, we expect this to do certain things.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:48.460
Does it actually do those things in a tactical sense, not in the strategic like we're targeting with MT?

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:56.460
So when we talk about principle number five, and I didn't phrase this very well, kind of on purpose because I wanted to get that answer before I rephrased it.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:03.460
When we talk about, when we say the customer is the only one able to evaluate, we use the word evaluate, the quality of our product.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.460
Yes.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:16.900
And then people freak the hell out because you're just asking customers to test your product because you're lazy and you're harming people and you're a jerk and I don't like you, I'm going to go in my corner.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.900
But I don't know about you, but all of those are true.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.900
They are.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.900
I am lazy.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.940
What are what are customers?

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.940
What is it that we want from customers to do to the product?

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.060
I am.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.060
I'm going to lead you along here.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.060
They're not testing it for they're not testing it.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:49.060
We're not trying to use customers to figure out this is the difference I'm driving towards is we don't use customers to test for functional correctness or to or to make sure it's working.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:25:01.700
We use it to validate that we're building the right thing or what or whether there's product market fit or or to learn more about what we are doing right and wrong with the product.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.700
So what I was I did I particularly left the word customer out.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:18.960
But the conversation in this meeting got to a point of like it was a little bit of they're worried like there's a little bit of worry from the exec that the customers were going in this early release.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.960
Customers were going to be finding quality issues and absolutely not the case.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.960
The quality of this product is very very good.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.960
It just is feature lean.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.110
OK.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:39.110
But enough it has enough functionality and this is what a minimum viable product is about.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.110
This one is actually bigger than that.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:50.110
Actually tangent tangent inception had a nice conversation with my boss yesterday about the concierge MVP.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:54.110
But anyway we it was a good conversation.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:26:00.110
I made the point that quality is something we build in and a little bit of collaboration how we do that.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:10.110
And one hundred percent what we expect from having a customer use this product is validation of whether we're building the right product not a validation of whether it's going to be a product.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:14.110
Validation of whether it's good enough quality for them to use.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.420
Yeah.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.420
I'll tell you I just use the language from Reese on this one.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.420
I talk about the pivot or persevere meeting. Yes.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.420
Yes. And I think that I'm actually driving a lot toward that.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.420
I think my hunch is I'm not going to leave this.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.420
I'm not. I'm going to wait and see.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.420
My hunch is that we will need to pivot that we're building a good product.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.420
But the product we're going to build is a subset of what we think we're building.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.420
But I'm going to wait and see what happens based on the customer.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.420
I think is going to be a nice pivot in there.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:54.420
But the cool point I brought up was I was able to bring up only the customer only the customer is able to evaluate the quality of software in the meeting without anybody freaking out or screaming.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.970
But the quality work gets a little over.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.970
No. And that's because you're the test guy.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.970
And I'm not the tough. No no no.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.320
You get number one.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.320
That's fantastic.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.320
That response number two.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:17.440
So I have as an aside I am formerly from test.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:38.080
My manager is formerly from test and recently my VP was getting heat from his boss around quality issues with respect to co correctness and old school PMs were going to my VP saying we need to get a testing back.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.080
Oh now's our opportunity.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.080
We need to get a testing back.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:49.590
The VP ran through the motions and was talking to some people around God.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.590
Yeah.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:28:07.580
So both myself and my manager were were in those informationals and my manager and I had multiple private conversations around.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.580
OK.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.100
First thing we got to do is stop this.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:19.640
We need to make sure that no test manager comes in here.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.640
Like we do not want that role here.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:32.640
If we can't succeed in that then we need to absolutely make sure this is not a role either one of us are asked to take on.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:43.580
I have a reputation in certain lights of I call it being punished for being good.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:54.650
I get assigned things that I don't want to sign to me because I have experience in credibility about closing that loop quick.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:58.030
I don't did not want this role.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.030
It was an interesting segue.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:15.030
It's funny because when I first joined the monetization team so it's been about 10 weeks now we had a couple of major incidents due to just developer error lack of testing lack of.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.030
We normally do very good testing.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:26.030
We just messed up two big ones expensive ones and my boss because I think because I was branded to the team and he knew my background he was threatening to hire a test team.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:32.030
So do I just need to hire a test team to help you and I'm going no no no no and it was an idle threat.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:42.450
It was just like get the team just as it was a conversation starter and through no work of mine through just a general the team does very well.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:52.270
In fact all of our incidents effect can I say this on air most of our incidents now are probably because of.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:57.270
Yes you can say that especially in the Microsoft.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:06.270
I shouldn't say most but a chunk of them so but there's no reason we shouldn't be resilient to the platform or under so that's another stage of maturity and growth for us.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:16.690
But my role is interesting in that I have the way my boss puts it.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.690
I have I.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.880
How does he put it.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.170
I'm the director of program management and this is different than Microsoft program management.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.170
I don't know what they do.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:33.170
This is making sure our larger scale projects are nothing actually good.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.170
Good describe it is I make sure there are no surprises.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:49.260
Making sure it's a lot of just asking we do I do a status reporting thing just a quick little week log every week to my manager rolls up to a org wide mail.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:55.260
But one of my summaries recently was mainly I just asked a lot of questions.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.780
Okay which is kind of like branded at the real estate class.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:09.780
So I just ask people questions and try and lead them in a direction and then I plug myself in and my boss will plug me in the places.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.780
Hey this is weird.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.780
Go take care of this.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.780
That's go figure out what's weird then go take care of it.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.780
So I'm at my fingers in just about every part of the org.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.780
I run a weekly meeting where I go over not quite a status meeting.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:35.780
It's really more for product management product marketing about release dates to make sure we understand where there's risk to what we're planning to deliver and an org of about 160 engineers to 50 ish overall.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.780
There's a lot going on.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:41.780
So keeping things organized making sure a lot of just making sure communications happening.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:55.900
Then I have this quality lever and I don't know if it's a if I don't know if my charter is quality with program management as a tool to get me there or if my role is program management with quality as a lever to get me there.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:03.900
It's been interesting to see how well those two work together.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:17.860
So if I'm looking at a program like how we can deliver this complex project it's getting I think the team's pretty good about most testing but it's like asking questions like so what's the developer experience here?

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.860
How are they going to use this?

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.860
What's what's that going to be like?

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:31.900
Oh yes kind of crummy and or what are getting them think about load or for latency up front is part of what I do.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.900
And then sometimes I realize I get to the end of the week.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:43.900
I didn't think much about testing this week should have I I don't know. No no no no because what you're trying to do.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:51.900
So what you reminded me of is the acceptance review in in scrum.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.900
Are you familiar with this concept?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.900
Oh yes.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.900
So you have a product owner.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.900
They set out the requirements.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:04.900
And then an ideal acceptance review occurs after when the developer says it's done.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:09.250
The ideal acceptance review is an interview.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:21.250
The PM's who I know of who do acceptance reviews badly will load up the product and essentially be a test team for that developer and fine bucks.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.250
That is not what you want to do.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:27.760
What you want to do is you want to interview them.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:33.760
Don't load the product because that keeps you objective and say OK.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:41.100
So how did you assure that latency isn't going to be an issue for our customers.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:48.100
How did you assure that this is going to scale to an outage.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.100
Like for example there's a new end.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.100
And this is the PM interviewing the developer or the development team.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.140
This is whether or not right.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:01.140
So it's essentially you ask a bunch of questions very similar to what you're doing.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.140
You do not load the product.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:11.220
And what you are trying to do is gain confidence that they did the work necessary.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.610
Yeah.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:13.610
Right.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.860
Makes sense.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.860
I have a I have a service that I'm shipping.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:27.900
It's about to be customer facing matter of fact just two weeks ago I shipped my first customer facing model.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.410
I'm very excited about that.

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:38.410
And but the particular scenario I'm doing only triggers during an outage.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:47.440
OK so there's an outage happening so then this scenario is is intended to ease the customer pain during an outage.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:58.780
And I'll tell you I don't have a good sense on the concurrency that my service is going to be called in the in terms of an outage.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.780
And I'm worried about that.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.780
So I'm like OK can we figure out how to fake an outage without pissing off customers.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.780
Is there a way to do that.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.780
Bring back staging environment.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.780
Bring back int.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:18.330
We have multiple staging environments and trying to get rid of at least two of them.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.330
Yeah.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:27.900
We can go back to another way to describe my job is I am simultaneously trying to accelerate the team and improve quality.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:34.060
And because when we have those outages I don't think you can do that mutually exclusive.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:44.060
I could make the team go super fast and break things or you can't accelerate quality or I could stop deployments that would that would slow down incidents.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:57.540
So ideally I find if I'm successful the quality of the services improve overall and there's tons of ways to measure that with downtime or incidents or whatever.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:13.540
And our ability to deploy quickly and we know from we both read accelerate with another good book from modern testing is there is correlation between deployment velocity and quality which seems weird.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:21.540
But it makes sense if you're if you deploy lots of small changes probably you have a system where you're you can recover from quality issues quality improve.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:34.540
So I another book we still from a lot is accelerate if you read between the lines if you haven't read accelerate we just had a book club on one of the three dot slack dot com where people talked about that.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:45.540
But the quality culture transition guide it was in my head for a long time you've heard this story and if you haven't seen that go to one of the three dot slack dot com it's pinned to the general channel.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.540
When I created that it didn't gel in my head until I read accelerate.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:58.930
So you'll find some of you should find you should be able to get to the point where they talk about maturity models and how they work and how they don't work.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:08.930
And they talk about some attributes you'll kind of see hopefully because it happened some influence of how accelerate led to that maturity grid.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:19.930
But let me make that I just finished I finished reading accelerate in the end.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:26.440
One of the things that I found super insightful.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:32.440
So I talk about co correctness and quality of separate things.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:41.440
And co correctness is the bug side and quality is the customer satisfaction side.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:56.180
What I realize where the dots are connected and you just brought it up co correctness is very important but it's very important especially for given.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:09.840
What accelerate is saying in today's modern society modern world is still very important but its purpose is to speed up cycle times.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:19.510
You cannot scale crap right so the purpose of quality is to be able to build things faster.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:32.670
Now building things faster is has never been a traditional testing role but it is all it has been a traditional additional crap job test gets assigned.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:43.210
Now in this world where you are responsible in the service world where speed wins.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:50.460
Yeah you need to make sure you're building a quality product and then you're getting it out there fast.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:39:08.720
Reading that book what it did for me is it reinvigorated my belief in principle seven because we need to get development understanding how to get their code correct.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:18.700
The first time once that happens testability concerns go out the door right.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:31.700
We've already mentioned it several times accelerate has shown that when test or when dev owns the test automation is correlated with positive business and outcomes.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:40.760
But you can't really focus on that right. A lot of the lot of the old school traditional testing they want us to focus continue to focus on bugs.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.340
Speed is important. I've said it over and over again the last several years.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:58.620
But going a hundred million miles an hour and building a product no one wants is perhaps worse than going two miles an hour.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.620
Building a product everyone wants. Absolutely.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:17.190
That second piece the customer quality point of view is where I think test is better suited than doing death job for them and helping them to slow down the product.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:28.190
I just yesterday I was reading going through Reddit and I'm subscribed to the software testing subreddit and I should just get off there because it's it's 1990s encapsulated.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:37.190
And there was a question just yesterday someone asked who does the who does the was just unit testing who does the testing on your team.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:48.190
I read an article said that developers do some of the testing and their apply is no on my team the QA is right the unit test the QA is right the unit test the QA is.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:54.190
Yeah. And yeah. There's a whole idea of QA testing bugs the crap out of me.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:41:01.190
That's a team that's throwing away money. I want to have my dream. I have a dream. I'm not sure how possible this would be given.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:10.190
I think I don't think we're worthy of it but it wouldn't be fun to see if we get Nicole Forsgren on a be testing.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:19.190
It would that would be fantastic. I'm going to work up to that. I got it. I got to work out my nerve get my get get something going to convince her.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:27.190
I have a hunch that she's super super busy. I suspect to maybe we can get her for a half hour.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:34.350
But that book actually has multiple authors so we don't have to just try for Nicole. Yeah but she did all the research.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:40.350
So I'm really interested. So definitely the lead author on that. I want to pick her brain. Yeah.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:51.350
All right. The other thing I was going to mention before we close is that I didn't get to earlier. It was how much coaching I do.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:42:00.350
And it's interesting. I thought when I joined this team I would be coaching the team on writing tests and on how to think about testing.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:05.350
And they actually understand it pretty well. Oh my God developers know how to test. Oh my God. What kind of crazy world is this.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:09.350
Yeah they do a pretty good job. There's some larger end to end or integration things that they need some help on.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:20.350
And I'm helping with that. But I end up doing most of my coaching although I'm not certified in just how to do something.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:25.350
I mean we call it agile how to do something that makes sense. Too late really bring this up.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:32.350
But things like no that's not a story. It's phrase like a story. So yes it's a story.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:41.350
But that would take three months to finish. So how can we break this down. So things like that just little bits of coaching like how can we.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:47.350
How can we. What if we wanted to ship every week. What would that look like. How could we do that.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:55.350
I don't know if we do. Let's go a little deeper. So lots and lots of things like that just getting people to think about.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:43:05.350
It's again I am not that smart but sometimes I'm good at coming up with the right questions. The Socratic method of the difference. Yes.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:20.350
The Socratic method is fantastic. Where it feels with me is a lot of times I know the answer and I'm impatient. So I'll go. That's true.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:28.350
Hey Alan have you thought about this. And actually that's a failure in the Socratic method never.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:37.450
You're using a Socratic method never ask a question that can be answered with yes or no. That's the first lesson I'll give on it.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:47.450
Yes. And then if you do use it and you know the answer then and you have a problem with patience as I do.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:44:05.860
Then I found a little trick and that is make it a game. And that is can you get them to say the correct answer before you lose your patience and say it yourself.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:14.860
So you know how some of those games have little timers. Yeah. Yeah. Another one I've used and we'll go. Well nobody's waiting kicks out of the room yet.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:24.890
Another one I've used is and this is again I don't. Maybe it helps that I have made a lot of mistakes in my life and in my career. It does for sure.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:32.890
Because the other one that works out really well is just asking them like things like if I help someone prep for a meeting yesterday.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:39.210
So let's think about what questions are going to be asked and what questions. What do you mean.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:47.210
Like there's another one of these exec reviews today of this product said. So what are they going to ask about. They're going to ask about how we're going to validate.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:53.500
So they're going to ask about probably going to ask about what customers are we bringing on board. What's your answer there.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:59.500
And just putting you know thinking about. I guess it's a lot like you and a prep for like an exact review.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:11.500
And I guess it's like thinking about the like put yourself in the other person's shoes whether it's the example I gave earlier like what's the developer experience or let's anticipate what questions are going to be asked.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:19.070
That's a better way to prepare and it's like laying out agenda and trying to overwhelm them with information. You know one thing you haven't talked about.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:27.030
And I'm surprised because I remember the last time you did it you came back and you communicated it's hugely successful.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:36.030
That's the hypothesis testing exercise I taught you back in 82. Have you done that yet. Yeah. I'm done a little bit a lot.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:48.030
OK. I even in fact I'm going to talk about the hypothesis testing exercise specifically in the Ministry of Test module course that covers principle five.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:55.030
Nice. All right. So yeah I use that a lot. I even did a workshop on that.

00:45:55.030 --> 00:46:06.030
I included that at our we had a quality team offsite in January that I attended and gave a presentation that. So yeah. Yeah. No it's a good thing. It's a good way to think about things.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:13.800
The team is. Yeah. They're pretty good at that sort of thing. So I haven't had to do it much in this or. But we talk about it from time to time.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:21.800
That's it in a nutshell. We'll have. We're going to go in two weeks again. Do you think maybe four weeks. Two weeks. All right. We'll figure it out.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:31.800
I have a vacation the third week of August. I think I'm going to England then anyway for work. OK. So we'll figure it out. All right.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:39.800
Thanks for sitting through our planning session. As always I am Alan and I'm Brent. We'll see you next time.
