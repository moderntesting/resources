WEBVTT

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.390
Hello again.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.390
Howdy, I'm Alan.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.390
I'm Brent.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.430
Another episode of AB testing.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.990
Another principle being knocked off, episode number 84, principle number 83.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.710
No, no.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.970
Yeah, we greatly expanded the principles between last time and this time.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.590
There are now 83 principles.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.670
No, principle number three, as those of you who are just catching up, maybe it's your

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.630
first episode, AB testing is a podcast.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.510
If it is your first episode, please stop and go back to episode number 60.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.010
You've missed a lot.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.710
But if it is your first, thank you.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.510
The context of previous episodes will help.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.430
But we are a podcast about software testing, software quality, agile, process improvement,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.350
leadership, random topics including squirrels with hats and things like that.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.390
And most recently, over the past over a year now, maybe longer, I don't know when we first

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.950
started talking about modern testing.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.950
We've mentioned the word for a while, but we've been talking in depth about something

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.270
we've been calling modern testing for quite a while now.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.030
Yeah, we've been talking about it for a long time.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.110
I think it is about a year where we capitalized the letters.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.910
We were talking about it for a while when I submitted a talk on modern testing to Test

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.910
Bash Brighton.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.040
Anyway.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.480
Yeah, I think in terms of the numbers.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm so prepared with my facts.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
As usual, I'm sure.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.820
I could be a speechwriter for Donald Trump, where facts don't matter.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.820
So back on track, we've been talking recently about modern testing principles.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.300
We wrote seven of them.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.980
They're still a work in progress, but they've actually remained static for the last several

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.980
months.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.460
It's a pretty good sign.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.330
You can read them on moderntesting.org.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.490
And today we're going to talk about the third modern testing principle.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.010
But before that, let's take a moment to see what's going on in the world of Alan and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.290
Brent.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.490
It's part of our pitter patter fast forward like five minutes if you don't like this

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.490
part.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.490
What's new, Brent?

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.400
Are you surviving review season at Microsoft?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.300
It's almost over.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.860
But yeah, I'm surviving.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.420
I will probably be sacrificing another weekend to close it out.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.940
So at Unity, of course, we don't have that heavyweight blood pressure inducing ego driven

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.660
review process.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.060
Three times a year, we have a discussion where we have we asked three questions.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.700
Why is your mission at Unity important?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.380
What are you doing to accomplish that mission?

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.380
And how are you doing?

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.410
And you told me.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.530
About a quarter of the way through.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:14.260
It is such good conversations and little prep involved, a little prep, but just a little

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.860
prep and nobody on either side has their blood pressure go up.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.860
It's great.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.860
I love it.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.380
You've mentioned this before, but the one thing that you shared with me off air was that there's

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.780
no written component to this.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.780
Yeah, we don't.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.780
Yeah.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.940
Oh, so literally when you say conversation, it literally is a conversation.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.940
It's a focused reflective conversation.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.190
I love it.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.270
Yeah, it's pretty great.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.590
But I take notes.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.790
So I mean, they're just for me.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.510
Because my job as a manager, of course, is to help them be successful.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.190
In fact, after those three questions, the question I always ask is, what can I do as

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.030
a manager to help you be successful in your mission?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.950
What can I start doing, stop doing, continue doing those sorts of things.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.190
And I'll take lots of notes there.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.260
And that helps me throughout the year.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.780
Until we have that conversation again.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.340
And things change direction, mission can change, but it helps me do a better job.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.500
I really like that aspect.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.700
So there's a language that rolls around with my team.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.540
I'm not, I'm pretty sure I've shared this before.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.380
I am not their manager.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.460
I am their MSP.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.460
I am their management service provider.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.060
Which means they are my customer more than they are my employees.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.220
And so, yeah, I'm really interested.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.220
How can I help you succeed?

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.020
How do I support that?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.460
So are you aware of the concept of servant leadership?

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.460
Yep.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.460
So tell us very much like that.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.900
I'm a big fan of that.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.260
And Simon Sinek for a plug has a great book called Leaders Eat Last, which talks a lot

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.260
about that.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.620
That's very much my view.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.620
Yeah.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.700
Yesterday, as an example, we had a, my team had a morale event.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.420
It's one of those escape room things.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.660
Have you ever done that?

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.660
Oh yeah.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.660
I've done a couple of them.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.660
Yep.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:18.090
I still have not because there was a logistic error and we thought we had three rooms scheduled

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.650
we only had two.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.090
And I'm like, yeah, I want the ICs to go.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.810
My manager was like, but I'm like, no, there's only eight people.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.810
They go.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.890
Did you go to the one right down here?

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:31.890
In Redmond.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.890
Okay.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.450
There's one, there's literally one walking distance from here.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.690
No, we didn't go to that one.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.690
I've been to that one.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.180
Of course, people listening going walking distance.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.180
What?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.180
Shut up.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.180
Tell me the damn principle.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.180
Yeah.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.180
I did one in San Francisco.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.340
The one in San Francisco was elaborate.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.260
We did it as almost my whole ads quality team.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.660
So it was, it's made for a big group.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.420
There were a lot of puzzles that could be solved independently and they, and they require

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.900
like people solving two different puzzles to share information.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.340
It was, it was like two, two plus hours with 12 or maybe 12 or more of us.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.940
It was pretty, it was, it was a ton of fun.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.020
They, we didn't, they gave us a little extra time, but we got it done.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.020
Yeah.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.020
No.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.020
So I was actually really looking forward to it.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.660
I mean, I knew it was going to be something that I would have to wait for a more relevant

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.460
to be able to go to it.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.780
And now it seems like I'm probably going to have to change teams if I ever wanted.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.950
Well, you and I can go.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.950
Sure.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.950
If you're going to do something with unity in your team, invite me along.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.390
I'll be happy to join.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.390
Okay.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.830
And so the other thing, uh, what about you?

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.830
What's new?

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.430
I'm a little tired.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.190
I woke up at two 45 this morning.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.190
Okay.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.310
To take my kid to the airport, uh, for like a five 30 flight.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.990
He is going with his eighth grade class, just finished two days ago to DC in New York for

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.990
a week.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.990
Nice.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.230
And then I came home, slept a little bit, went to the gym, came home, showered, came

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.230
here.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.150
So I'm, I'm a little bit of fumes here, but, uh, everything else is going great.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.150
What's the occasion?

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.720
Um, eighth grade trip.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720
Is there no point to it?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.360
Just, Hey, eighth grade, let's go to DC.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360
No, no, no.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.040
It's a massively educational trip.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.320
They are packed from morning to night with, uh, all over DC for two days, then all over

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.560
New York for three days.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.240
And then, uh, New York city, New York city.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.240
Cool.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.800
So they're going to have a good time.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.280
He's looking forward to the view from the top of the empire state building, which I've

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.280
done before.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.630
It's a long way down.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.630
It's pretty cool.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.630
Yeah.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.150
I've done the view from the bottom of it.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.150
Oh, great.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.700
That's a long way up.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.700
Yeah.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700
All right.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.460
Well, uh, anything else before we get started?

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.820
Where in the world is the weasel?

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.860
Like we both, we both did the, uh, Oh yeah.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.780
I am doing a virtual weasel now.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.380
I'm as I've mentioned many times before, I'm trying to cut way down on the, at least

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.980
the travel I do for conferences.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.170
I'm still doing star.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.530
I have some gripes about that.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.930
I'll share offline, but I'm doing star and at very beginning of October and then PNSQC,

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.090
which I'm really looking forward to, uh, doing an invited talk there on modern testing.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.090
Nice.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.490
It'll be a definite huge evolution or a large evolution from what I gave it.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.650
Test Bash Brighton, but something along those lines.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.410
And then I'm doing virtual world.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:31.810
I did two, uh, webinars Wednesday, one for the online test conference, one for the test

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.810
automation guild.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.530
I'll be doing another webinar with perfecto mobile on Monday, which you'll probably

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:42.480
hear about, which probably over by the time this episode comes out, uh, on continuous testing,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.120
which overlaps with our pro with our, our discussion today.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.440
And then I just, uh, got booked this week.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.720
I'm way, way, way excited, especially relevant to AB testing listeners.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.520
Uh, administrative test has invited me to give an AMA and ask me anything about modern

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.920
testing eight o'clock UK time.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.400
That's noon here on the, uh, on the West coast.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:11.720
So at a time when most of our listeners can probably check it out live and ask questions

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.550
and it is on July 10th, just like I said, I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.350
There'll be a link to it on my blog.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.630
You can find that on Twitter, all kinds of ways to discover it should be a ton of fun.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.070
Here's what we should do.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:31.430
I will do the AMA and what happens on these things is a ton of questions come in that

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.000
you can't get to.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.280
We could probably shove a couple of mail bag episodes full of those overflow questions.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.280
Uh, yeah.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.760
Why don't you just, Hey, we can continue the conversation, blah, blah, blah.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.400
Join the slack channel mail bag channel.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400
Yeah.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400
Right.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.480
Or I'll just, yeah, just, or listen to the podcast and I will, and I will just take

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.280
all of those, anything we don't get to, I will take as a mail bag fodder.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.280
We have right now we have a queue on the mail bag.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.830
I think we're like 10, 15 questions behind.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.980
We are not, we are not that many behind.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.300
We have a question around ethics.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.740
We have like, well, I thought we'll have like one other question.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.740
No, I don't know.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.070
Well, then there's one in my email inbox that I haven't bothered to bring out yet.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.350
So maybe, maybe next episode, we should, we should catch up on the, yeah, at some

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:29.710
point we should do a mail bag episode and then we can continue trucking on the principles.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.710
Oh, and I've recorded a new mail bag sound.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:37.910
One of the things people didn't realize is when I do the mail bag thing, it's

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:43.150
live every time that I go add some reverb while I'm editing and I got tired of doing

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.150
that.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.430
So I just made one mail bag sound, a little bit of harmony, just a tiny bit of

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.150
reverb, not as obnoxious, but I will never have to sing that in front of Brent

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.150
again.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.030
So that's the good part.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.990
And that's, we should probably get going.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.990
It's caught up on the news.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.310
I'm sorry if you fast forward to five minutes and I'm still talking about BSC don't

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.690
care about, but let's dive into modern test

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.090
testing principle number three.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.050
If that's okay, Brent says not yet.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.050
Not yet.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.130
So there's one thing.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:13.130
So earlier this week, earlier this week, Alan and I were on a panel for the online

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.130
test conference.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.130
Right.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.130
I mentioned that a minute ago.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.130
Yeah.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.630
And so the one thing that I found fascinating.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.170
So Joel gave me the data beforehand and there's one.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.890
That's Joel from practice test, the host of the online test conference.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.690
There's one thing that I actually found interesting.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.490
Where, so I did some, some very lightweight data science.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.050
I looked at the, one of the questions were, are you concerned about your job

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.050
stability?

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.690
And one of the things that I found very fascinating was essentially there's

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:58.310
evidence in the data that, that those folks that are sort of snapping to, I

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.290
won't say necessarily modern testing.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.450
We don't actually care if you follow modern testing.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.650
If you, if you pick up the same principle and you think you're following lean,

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.850
great. That's fine.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:15.290
But those POVs or those point of views that were more aligned with modern

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.290
testing, they weren't concerned about the job security.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.330
Those that were more traditionalist were very concerned about the job

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:30.090
security. So one thing I take away from that is our work here that we're

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:36.800
trying to do, the more that we can get people to see that there is this other

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.520
way forward, the less anxious potentially they become.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.400
I think so. And one of the reasons I'll continue our tangent here, maybe it's not

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.170
a tangent. I am really enjoying talking about modern testing at these

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.450
conferences and bringing it up because there are people who are scared.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.610
We can't, I don't want to do that.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.850
And there are people that go, I want to do that.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.490
And a surprising number of people who are saying, yeah, I'm doing that.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.290
And it's like, whoa, this is really cool.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.410
I wanted to share something, a private conversation that I had on Slack on our

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.930
one of the three dot slack dot com channel.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.450
If you go to anger weasel dot com, whack AB testing, you can find a link to

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.370
join yourself, but I'm going to abbreviate and Michael, I apologize.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.050
I didn't ask for permission, but I'm probably violating all of GDPR.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.730
I will paraphrase here.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.530
It says their engineering team is adapting to work in a way that is aligned

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.010
with the modern testing principles.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.050
We're doing some of it already, just kind of naturally, but the head of

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.450
engineering has told the department to get on with it now as testers.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.970
We've been pushing it since your talk at test bash this year and a few

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.410
minutes I'm showing your talk to the whole department.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.230
So that I, wow, it's pretty cool.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.070
I said exactly that font.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.310
It says the video went down pretty well.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.870
One of the leaders just said, this just sounds like common sense.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.510
It should just be engineering principles, which we should probably address.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.030
But I think that's great.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.030
You know what?

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.030
It should be.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.270
They're going to monitor the uptake of things, do some more pairing and

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.910
told them to stay in touch and we'll, uh, and we'll see what happens.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.910
But that's, that's so exciting to hear.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.510
Yeah.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:25.190
No, uh, uh, hey, if, if, if we're somehow being the last spark of

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:30.630
credibility, that it's getting leaders to, you know, flip the switch.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.190
Fantastic.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.420
That yeah.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.340
Anyway, yeah, let's go.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.380
Shall we go modern testing principle number three, if you haven't

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.860
memorized it already, it says this.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.690
We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:55.210
optimize in order to succeed rather than providing a safety net to catch failures.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:56.970
There's a lot in there.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.810
There is.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.770
Where do you want to start brand?

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.730
What does that mean?

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.090
So we're going to talk about not the what, but also the why and the

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.690
how, if we are, if we're lucky.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.130
If we do, if we do it.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.690
All right.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:09.370
All right.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.330
So I am going to take it on from the reverse of the principles.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:25.110
Well, so what this says is to me, we are going to favor continuously, uh,

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:31.790
improving and adapting above a safety net prevention model.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.770
And, and actually I realized I said that very agile manifestly.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.890
I don't actually think it's even a favor.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:46.130
Like my preference would be thou shalt kill thine safety net.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:47.570
Right.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.930
That that's how I simplify it.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.850
The way I put it, we talked a little bit about this, uh, before we, uh,

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.090
press the record button, but this ties to the last principle.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.970
A safety net is a great example of a bottleneck.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.530
For sure.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.800
Uh, and it also doesn't allow it's, it talks, it builds that co-dependency.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.600
We've talked about where like, please, here's my code.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.720
Please find my bugs.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.640
Oh, here's, here are some bugs.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.040
So thank you for finding my bugs.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.480
Everybody feels validated.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.560
But in the meantime, the customer is going, where's my damn software?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.220
There was something I was reading.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:25.360
It was a comment chain around something we've done in modern testing.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.440
I don't remember what it was.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.840
Maybe it was Twitter, maybe it was Slack, but the comment that I'm just sick of is.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.310
Well, you know, Dev doesn't want to do test.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.310
Yeah.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.590
Oh yeah.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:45.150
And I'm just like, and, and right.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.550
It's it's, um, Oh, I remember, I remember where it was now.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.230
And one of the things I found, I, I did like one thing that's unique about

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.830
tests, like, and we shouldn't go too far into this, the safety net here.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:06.320
But one of the things that's unique about tests is, is, uh, how many other

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:12.960
software engineering roles are you aware of where leaders in the discipline

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.280
stand up and say, Oh, we're validated because another discipline doesn't

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.520
want to do this job.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.800
What the hell is that?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:23.480
Right.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.680
That's that's, that's, that's not a declaration of value.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.240
It's not a declaration of, uh, return.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:39.930
It's it's, um, I, again, I think of your, your, uh, elephant slides or the parade

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.810
slides, it's not a good way to go.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.530
It doesn't define the discipline in a positive way.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:18:01.330
The safety net aspect, um, in the, the dysfunctional enablement loop, um, is

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.740
bad for multiple reasons.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.740
Uh, as, as Alan called out, it's, it creates a bottleneck.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.500
We want to be against bottlenecks.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.620
The second thing is there's, there's a lot of new techniques out.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.520
And if we're trying to finally move quality upstream, right?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.720
We're not in the coaching principle, but you know, um, like all good set of

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.840
principles, they build off of each other.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:35.520
Um, if we're going to get quality upstream, we have to retrain our developers to

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.360
succeed without the safety net.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.200
And that is in essence, what I view this principle.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.140
It's, it's not about getting it right the first time.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.380
It's about getting the learnings right on the first mistake.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.340
Yes.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.380
Yes.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.340
Don't be so afraid of making mistakes.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.500
Don't yeah, I get that.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.540
Um, I've been thinking about this principle and then overall, something

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.020
I shared with you, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to improve

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.540
a quality culture, which we'll get to in a, in a later, uh, principle, but

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.420
something that aligns here, I was thinking about that.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:15.980
And then I, I, I tweeted this, this week, which was sadly too many people

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.780
in teams think quality is limited to testing.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:26.140
And that ties in here, I think pretty well, because we need to train and help

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.820
our developers do better testing.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.380
That doesn't eliminate our job because there's a lot more to quality, uh,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.020
then simple functional verification.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:46.060
Uh, internally, uh, one of the things that I have found very helpful is,

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.420
um, is the language around code correctness versus quality.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:59.200
And so when I, when I talk to devs, I mean, it it's look dude, code correctness.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.260
Uh, I'm, I'm here to help coach you through it, but you own code correctness.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.990
You own it a hundred percent, right?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.870
I'll, I'll, I'll help you brainstorm.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:11.910
I'll help you think through it.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.350
I'll help.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.670
I'll introduce you to tools.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.670
I may even bootstrap you in a certain direction, but

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.950
code correctness is what you own.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.290
And, um, we all own quality.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:30.250
And so I try to weave a conversation in a way that makes it very clear that in

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:35.090
this man's humble opinion, code correctness and quality are entirely different things.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.890
And that generally works well.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.330
And it feeds into the conversation.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.970
Well, wait a minute.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.450
What's quality then?

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.170
Subject to point of view of the customer rate.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:43.810
We've had this.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:52.080
I have found that taking, taking that belief and taking it on and decom, uh, what

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:59.380
would be the de-overloading, the overloading the term helps the conversation move forward.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.780
Let me do a one last comment on that.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.500
I want to dig into a few more details on continuous improvement.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:10.160
We're a little bit in by design, the principles compliment and overlap each other.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.640
For sure.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.080
Uh, this one's a little bit more in how we coach the team, but I want to share a

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.040
conversation I had just recently around training developers or helping developers

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.000
become better testers.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.680
I was talking to a dev lead who is very much new to unity, new to, uh, new to, new

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.600
to Alan is subtle, modern testing pushes, uh, subtle.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.880
Uh, I can be subtle.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:41.470
Uh, he was very much in the camp that developers can't test their own code.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.080
Oh my God.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.040
So they're, they're, they're too biased.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:53.880
And my, my answer was my initial answer was, eh, yeah, probably initially goes, well,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.040
they can only make sure it works.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.240
I can.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.320
Yeah, initially, but you know, I've probably taught 50 developers, probably

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.440
closer to a hundred, uh, who started off that way.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.520
I asked him a few questions I paired with them or, or whatever, and they could

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.080
learn that pretty quickly.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.560
They could learn to think about the ways the code doesn't work.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.880
They could learn to think about edge cases.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.950
It's not that hard to train as typically happens.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:25.950
I won, uh, because I think developers can do a very good job testing the, you need

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.150
to give them, this is going to tie back to what you're saying.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.390
Let them, they have to try it and learn from their mistakes.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.750
Yeah.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.760
And continuous improvement is about not being afraid to make mistakes, but

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.120
embracing mistakes as a learning opportunity.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:41.570
Yes.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.010
Um,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.130
and we don't do that enough.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:49.170
Uh, and that's getting over that hump is so huge and going, yeah, let's,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.490
let's get better at this.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.650
So we talk about the safety net, right?

00:22:53.650 --> 00:23:00.950
And, and literally when I, when I bring this up, um, right there, that here,

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.630
there's definitely a fear.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:07.710
And this is where I think, uh, tests plays a good role.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:12.870
They are the knowledge experts on testing generally in these type of teams.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.510
Right.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:20.380
What, what you just shared is that your, your dev expert, uh, your dev lead

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:27.540
or whatever this guy was, um, he expressed a belief that, you know, devs

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:28.700
can't test their own code.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.140
They're not objective, blah, blah, blah.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:30.940
Right.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.540
That, um, that to me says first and foremost, this is the guy who

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.020
doesn't know TDD BDD.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.900
And that would be the first place where I would start.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.340
So safety net, right?

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.900
Where else do you see safety nets?

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.640
Circus and the circus and the tight, uh, the, uh, for example, the tight

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.960
rope walkers, okay.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.040
Now, and so when I talk about a metaphor, you got to think about devs.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.200
Uh, when you're going through this transition, devs are used to having a safety

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.960
net, you know, they're up on the tight rope walker, they're doing cart wheels

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.920
and they're falling down all the time.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:05.920
Right.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.400
And what test has been doing is, is just building and building and building,

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.520
uh, even better, uh, safety net.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:21.960
Um, and in, you know, every now and again, a tight rope walker falls, falls off,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.680
injures themselves and it's not the tight rope walker, but it's blamed.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.600
It's generally the, Hey, we had the safety net.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.320
Why wasn't the safety net good enough?

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:32.840
Okay.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.600
Now, what we're proposing is get rid of the safety net because really what's

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.640
happening is they're not gathering the skills.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:48.030
So I have a patent for a, um, a test harness.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.150
I did, uh, I built back in 1998.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.590
I also have a useless patent.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.350
My thing is actually still an operation.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.470
Mine has probably been infringed upon a thousand times, but nobody cares.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.030
Yeah, but I think mine too, but it doesn't matter.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:11.460
But the, this, this automation framework, the way we designed it really made it

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.850
easy for automation to run and execute.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.570
One of the key things about it is it's a harness that can execute any test case.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:24.930
So if you are a dev team and you had, or back then it was a test team.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.050
If you had a particular way you did your automation and another team did it a

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:32.010
particular way that they did their automation, this one could run them all

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.690
together as a singular suite.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.000
It was also very componentized.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.120
So it made it very friction free to do automation fast forward about, uh, 10

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:41.920
years.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.880
And what we find is dev stopped using design patterns.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.680
Dev stopped even doing code reviews.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:56.000
What dev would do because the automation suite was so robust, they would

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.200
actually just check it in, let the automation suite run.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.040
They would get a result back in like 30 minutes and then they would go and

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.880
figure out what they're trying to do.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.360
Sounds like you built a safety net.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.840
I built an automated safety net.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.120
Yeah.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:10.600
Right.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.880
And so I didn't actually succeed in moving quality upstream and, and

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.680
making stronger code.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:25.440
What I did is I made a system that allowed them to do whatever stupid

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.720
behaviors in your architecture that they wanted.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.720
Now this is bad, uh, because sloppy architectures can't scale.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.920
You can't add new features to code like this with an efficient timeline.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:49.600
So what I'm suggesting when we get rid of the safety net, what keeping

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.000
the metaphor alive, if you get rid of the safety net, realize that part of

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.320
your job is to help influence and motivate folks to get better at

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.840
walking the tight rope.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.480
Now they're going to be anxious.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.360
So we're going to have to do the equivalent of, well, we're going to

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.400
have to retrain them how to walk this thing.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.090
So to make sure that they have a minimal risk of getting harm, let's

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.010
lower the tight rope such that when they fall off, because eventually

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.130
they're going to, there's less consequence.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.170
This is where the continuous improvement, stepping out of the metaphor,

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:32.410
this is where continuous improvement and adaptation, uh, come into play.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.140
Right.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:34.620
Yep.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.740
A little bit.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.220
I want to talk a little bit more about the safety net.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.180
I do want to dive into just really dive deeply into what continuous

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.700
improvement is and why it's important.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:49.620
Uh, and, and how we drive that, how we're a force, but your talk reminded

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:55.700
me of the headline that came out when Yahoo got rid of all their testers.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.400
Uh, we talked about ways to move to unified engineering, both Brent and I

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.280
believe that a unified engineering team is by far the most optimal way to ship

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.520
almost all software made today, maybe all software made today.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.880
Uh, but you can make that transition in a way that does not enable

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.920
your team for success.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.240
Uh, this is a classic example of be careful ripping off the band-aid

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.640
because it may be a turn again, but the headline from that came out.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:24.440
I, I've saved it and I use it in presentations once in a while is Yahoo's

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.360
engineers move to coding without a net subtitle.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.080
What happens when you eliminate test and QA fewer errors and faster

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.000
developments, say Yahoo's tech leaders.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.940
There's devil in the details, of course.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.380
Right.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.700
Uh, so what you're saying is they ripped the band-aid on that one.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.740
They ripped the tourniquet.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840
They ripped the tourniquet.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.100
Um, yeah.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.620
The article goes on to say by, um, by just getting rid of the safety net

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.580
completely devs automatically decided how to be more careful.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.980
Uh, they need some shocking.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:00.100
Right.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.540
And this is again, again, much like the safety net and the type rope, right.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:10.850
If, if they know that they've been goofing off on the type rope and

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.050
so you take away the safety net, they go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.320
Right.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.360
Now when I do a cartwheel, you know, nine times out of 10, I fall this time

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.640
on the, I'm going to severely injure myself.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.920
And the challenge is continuing the metaphor is maybe they've either

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.480
forgotten or never learned the proper technique that would enable them not to

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.080
fall, they're going to need a tightrope walking coach, probably some extra

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.120
training just to help them at first to make sure that they can succeed

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.760
and not splat on the floor.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.810
Right.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.850
And then, um, on the continuous improvement, right.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.090
It's, it's, it's not around.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.790
We got to escape out of the metaphor, but this, this will be the last one I try.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.950
Right.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.750
How do we lower the rope?

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:06.840
Then how do we, how, so that the risk is lower and get them improving one step at

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.800
a time, like the way you get across the wire is one step at a time.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.930
Right.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.290
And that in my view is kind of how this continuous improvement is.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.210
We're, we're down there.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.290
The net's gone.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.090
They take a step and we're like, Hey, your foot's not quite the right place.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.210
Adjust that before you take your next step.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:35.650
And as this, as this gets accustomed, as they are used to this becomes a new

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:40.200
muscle memory, they're not going to need you to do this right.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.840
And now escaping out of the metaphor, continuous improvement.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.750
To me, I think of, of, of Kaizen here.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.430
Yeah.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.110
And we're going to get into that in a minute.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.430
All right.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.870
But I just had a thought like I'm so sick of the word that the phrase shift left.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.190
I think it's stupid.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.710
I hate it.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.350
Yeah.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.950
Why left?

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.550
Why not right?

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.190
Why not up or down?

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.830
Could you quit fondling the microphone stand please?

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:03.030
Probably not.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:03.470
Okay.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:04.230
That's going to be great.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:05.030
Sorry for that.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:05.870
Good junk, good junk junk.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.350
I'm waiting for the new, like, I see articles a year from now.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.910
Help your dev team lower the rope.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.240
Hashtag lower the rope.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.480
Yeah.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.760
Okay.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.280
I will do, I'll talk about Kaizen.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.360
Self-fulfilling hashtag there.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.960
I think Kaizen is a topic we need to discuss today.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.200
Yep.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:30.120
But in the context of this question, sir, Brent, what is continuous improvement?

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.840
Um, I'll read you a definition.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.760
No, it's like, it's improving continuously.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:42.720
Yeah.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.640
Read the definition.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.720
I think you'll like it.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.520
This is from the Institute of Quality Assurance news flash.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.240
There's a thing called the Institute of Quality Insurance, which is probably like

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.000
two guys in a garage somewhere, but whatever.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.660
Uh, they define continuous improvement as a gradual, never ending change, which is

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.860
focused on increasing the effectiveness and or efficiency of an organization to

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.980
fulfill its policy and objectives.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:12.060
It is not limited to quality initiatives, improvement in business strategy, business

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.700
results, customer, employee, and supplier relationships can be subject to continual

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.260
improvement.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.740
Then the, my favorite part is the last part.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.900
I should just skip this right away.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.140
Put simply, it means getting better all the time.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.590
Yeah.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.440
It's not a bad definition.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.790
No, but all of the time, right?

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:36.750
This, this, this, this is, this is not every six months when we do the

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.470
two day post-mortem offsite.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.670
Yeah.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.790
Let's do a post-mortem and we'll make a big list of things that we're

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.710
probably not going to do.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.550
That is not continuous improvement.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.110
That's not even improvement.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:51.660
Uh, there's some argument that there's an element of, uh, catharsis.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:58.260
What I found in the old days, when we do those half day, full day, two day, uh,

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.740
post-mortems after a product, it was really just a nice venting session.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.340
Yes.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.540
And it was a nice venting.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.060
People feel better, not get better.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:09.700
Right.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.340
Did we already talk about actionable versus vanity?

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.340
Uh, I'm sure we hit that last time.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:15.940
Yeah.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.660
Or, or in the deep dive on Brent talks to Alan about data.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:20.540
Right.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.220
That actually, that is when we did it.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.780
So a continuous improvement.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.440
Um, I'll tell a story here.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.080
So when I first shifted to dev, I was a unified engineer.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:35.720
Okay.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.480
We started with scrum.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:44.860
Um, this was at a time where I was not actually very familiar with, with agile.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:51.570
Um, but we started with scrum and we made a tactical error.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.940
We had come up with a scenario, um, that actually required us to pretty much

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.980
change pieces in our entire architecture stack.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.930
And, uh, of course, just like with any scrum team, all the bugs got

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:13.270
introduced in the 11th hour and we came in the next day and found out.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:20.090
Nothing integrated because we had person a working on one piece of the

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:23.010
refactor person B working on another piece of refactor.

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:29.240
So we had done this in a two week sprint and it literally took us two

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.780
months to unscrew ourselves.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.760
And after we successfully did that, um, my team was like, Hey, uh, can we do

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.400
this Kanban thing you keep saying that we're going to do?

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.440
Cause I introduced scrum to them, uh, because I didn't think that they

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.480
were quite ready to go the Kanban.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.800
But after that, they were like, all right, let's do Kanban.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.560
This is stupid.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.280
And most teams have a much larger transition to get there.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:57.720
That's great.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:34:59.460
Yeah.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.940
So maybe that's it, you know, just completely abjectly fail, you know,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.900
your first two sprints and scrum.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.100
But isn't that improvement?

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.360
Uh, it was, uh, I kinda, you know, hindsight, 2020, I kind of wish it

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.920
hadn't cost me that two months of unscrewing myself.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.160
That's a, that was a high price to pay.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.340
But one of the things that we did once we started doing continuous flow,

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:34.460
got rid of, got, got rid of, um, the scrum model, one thing ended up happening.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:41.900
So I had a team of seven at that time, uh, with enough, um, tickets on the board.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:46.940
What I found is that every day someone on my team was releasing something.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:48.360
Okay.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.000
Cause here it's not, it's not major releases once every two weeks.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.080
It's no minor release, uh, every single day.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:06.990
And guess what happened when we found that the whole, we came in the next day

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:11.670
and it happened, came in the next day and we found our whole system was on the floor.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.910
Guess what happened?

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:14.990
You had to undo one change.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.160
Yeah.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.300
Took like 15 minutes.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.900
We, we knew exactly the cause cause there was only one thing that went in yesterday,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.060
which we could just readily revert.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.460
Whereas the big integration story, we couldn't readily revert that.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.950
Right.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.810
Um, it was too many different changes all at once.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.360
Um, it would be harder.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:39.760
Yeah.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.120
Yeah.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.920
I think that that's clear to everyone.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:48.040
And one of the things that I realized is our role as testers.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.580
So remember this is, this was like the first few months of me being in a dev

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.560
role, having left test.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:00.740
So I was still very focused on, on, um, my heart was still in test.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.660
Um, and I'm like, Oh my God, check that out.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:17.720
I way more efficiently reduce the risk by just moving to a continuous, uh,

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.490
integration model, right?

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.810
I didn't have to spend old school ways.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:30.410
I wouldn't, I would have done, um, like in the scrum example here, I did, I

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.410
released it and everything was on the floor and it took me two months to fix it.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:34.210
Okay.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.050
The old school model, I would have still spent that two months,

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.970
perhaps even longer before the release.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:40.980
Okay.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:45.760
So even then the scrum model in my view was better because I knew exactly what

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.420
I needed to fix instantly.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.980
I didn't have to deal with uncertainty, but then moving to a continuous

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.420
deployment model, I could do one small change at a time, make sure that

00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.880
the system handles it.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:06.620
And if it doesn't, the, I can revert it very rapidly from a test point of view.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:11.430
Again, if our job is to reduce risks of the business, getting this

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.710
continuous improvement thing, uh, rolling is a key one.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:15.150
Yep.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.350
Yep.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.430
You already went into a little bit of why, which is good.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.230
I want to dive more of that in a minute, but I do want to talk about Kaizen

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.010
while we're on the subject.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:27.070
I think you, I think as, uh, Embracers of the modern testing principles,

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.190
Embracers of continuous improvement, I think it's important to be at least

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:33.690
aware of the Japanese concept of Kaizen, which is one of the things

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:38.530
that comes out of lean, which is literally, I guess literally like make

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.690
better, but it, it, it's the Japanese word for improvement.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:45.350
One of the things I like about Kaizen, which is probably important to mention

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.770
is it is not just about how do we improve the pipelines?

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:50.990
How do we improve everything?

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:54.350
It could be the way the, everything from the way people are treated to

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:58.350
the processes that go through, just looking for those every day, all the

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.150
time, looking for those small things that can be improved.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.990
And because it's from lean, it's a big focus on reducing waste.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.710
Waste can be, waste can be resources, waste could be time, waste can be, um,

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.230
actually overlaps a little bit with bottlenecks.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.470
The continuous improvement has a lot to do with reducing bottlenecks.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:17.350
Yeah.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:23.590
But, um, so whenever I get in a conversation, when I'm, when I'm

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.290
onboarding a new set of people to an agile process and we start talking

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.750
about Kaizen, we start talking about waste.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.910
Right.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.670
Um, it's inevitable that I'll have a efficiency versus productivity conversation.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:41.950
So for example, when, when, uh, one of the key principles in Kanban is limit whip.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:42.550
Mm-hmm.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.680
And that seems like you're encouraging waste.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.000
Right.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.760
If I say, Hey, you know what, there can only be one ticket out on a board.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.080
That means Alan, you're idle.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.590
Right.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.070
There's this belief that, wait, I'm not being efficiently utilized.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.450
Therefore there is waste.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.610
And so when you sit, continuous improvement, right?

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.850
The other thing to keep in mind is that there's a goal.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.460
And then the goal is going to be different based on the context.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:12.420
Right.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:18.460
But in order to improve, you have to have something that you measure and you're

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.500
going, did that work better or not?

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.880
In this particular case, it's, uh, it's probably going to be for most of our

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.000
listeners, it's going to be an element of productivity, uh, because it is our

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.800
job to accelerate and, you know, productivity is a better measure of that

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.420
than efficiency, and it's going to be about quality, right?

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.640
Not co-correctness, but quality.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.560
Uh, are, are we helping to attract and hit the customers that we're going after?

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:47.840
Yeah.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.400
This ties directly back to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:51.840
Amen.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.320
Amen, brother.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.980
We spent a lot of time trying to figure out what, where do we improve next?

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.020
What's the next thing we improve?

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.780
How much do we improve it?

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.190
How much, you know, what boy really ties back into that bottleneck one from last

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:14.570
time, but before we go any farther, this is very DevOpsy, leanish agile.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:19.010
Why is this, why is it important to call this out as a modern testing principle and

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.710
not just common sense engineering principle or agile principle?

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.110
What, why is it part of the modern testing principles?

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.740
There are several agile principles.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.380
Um, I think this is important.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.540
There's several agile principles that just make sense.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.740
Like, um, what you were saying earlier, they, this is just a common

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.940
sense engineering principle.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:50.250
This one, I would say we call out because, uh, it's a critical process

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:57.890
change in, in, in our opinion, that's directly related to the goal of testing.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.280
The goal of quality.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.360
They, right.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.950
There, there are this principle while it sounds like an engineering principle.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.280
Uh, and it's because it is.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:17.680
Um, if, if you, if you are helping to lead and push and drive towards, uh,

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.080
a modern testing environment in your workplace, this one's important.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:31.040
Getting this lit up improves quality and reduces risk for almost no cost.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:36.370
I have a, yes, I agree with everything, but I have a slightly different take

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.290
on why this is a modern testing.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:40.690
I think it ties back to it.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:44.370
Although we've said before worth mentioning again, that, uh, there

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.170
isn't really a modern tester role.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:53.340
Uh, there can be a, uh, someone driving these modern testing principles on the

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.940
team, because probably most of the people listening to this podcast are in or

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.260
have been in test roles.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.620
Uh, you can relate.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:09.240
But I, I, uh, I think this one's important and it's been so, it's been so long.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.560
I think if I remember right, I drafted these and then we iterated the crap out of

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.200
it, or this was part of the original or not.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:22.640
But anyway, getting to my point testers, I think are not uniquely, but well

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.480
suited, very well suited to drive continuous improvement for a couple of reasons.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.000
Uh, two main reasons.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.560
One here, you mean from a leadership standpoint.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.640
So one is that our job is to see the system as a whole.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.120
Yes.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.520
That system thinking that because we do that, we can often find where

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.880
improvement needs to happen faster than anyone else on the team.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.600
I think we're, because of our background, because of what we've done,

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.200
we're very good at doing that.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:54.360
One of the things I ask my team to do, it's worth mentioning, uh, is that I

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.560
have not like plastered my team with the modern testing principles and said,

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.960
we're going to do these.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.520
Uh, some of my, some of my team listens to this podcast and they, you know,

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:11.660
they follow along, uh, but I mainly just try and drive improvement.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.620
And of course, uh, I follow modern testing principles as part of what I

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.060
do, so some of these things come out.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.110
Uh, so rewinding the stack.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.510
So I Brent's distracted me with his hyper legs.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:24.510
Um, maybe he has to go to the bathroom.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:25.390
I'm not sure.

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.790
Uh, one.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:30.550
So we see, we're very good at seeing the big picture of the

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.110
things, how things fit together.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:37.430
We're also very good at asking questions and often implying critical thinking.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:42.230
So we can often figure out what it is we need to do to improve or what the

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:47.110
root cause is that we need to improve in order to make things happen.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.430
So I think those things drive it very well.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:53.310
And then you might want to add to that, but that's going to tie into the

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:57.710
how I want to get into, uh, how do we drive continuous improvement?

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.350
And I've found my experiences and I'm curious to hear yours as well, Brent,

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:08.510
that testers are very well suited often, even above a product or program or a

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:12.510
project manager role to drive things like the retrospective that I think are

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.150
one of the key things that drive continuous improvement.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:22.890
My experience on this front is again, from, um, a unified engineering model.

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:31.240
Um, uh, since becoming a believer in this, I have not actually been

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.960
a part of separate disciplines.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:42.340
I will say that, uh, when I did unified engineering, right again, uh,

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.740
I've mentioned this before.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:49.580
I had a good split people who came from dev people who came from test.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:56.860
Um, and over time, uh, it was my, my former testers that ended up being

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:07.740
the better developers because they, they had the training to think about how

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.940
do I write the code?

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.260
How do I validate it?

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.340
And most importantly, how do I make sure I'm not wasting my time?

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.100
This is where the customer validation part comes into play.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.640
No one, no one wants to spend their time.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.960
We've talked about the pink principles.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.680
Um, no one wants to spend their time doing activity.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.000
They want their effort, their time to contribute to something larger.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.060
Right.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.740
So one of the biggest things that continuous improvement as an example,

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:46.980
a retrospective going with a Kanban board, um, it creates visibility where

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.340
visibility wasn't there before.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:55.180
And visibility is coming in and small enough chunks where it makes everyone

00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:02.260
have a non theoretical, um, concrete conversation about, Hey, this is

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.940
something that's actually hurting us.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.140
God, does anyone disagree?

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.500
Now, how do we go about fixing it?

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.770
Um, to address your prior question.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:19.660
Um, yeah, I would say from my experience, people in the test

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:27.290
world do pick up, you know, answering the end end questions better, uh, at, at

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:31.170
retrospectives and really retrospectives about asking the right questions.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.570
And that's something that's very well suited for, for someone in this role.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:37.930
Um, but even then it's ephemeral, right?

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:43.450
Because eventually, so when I did the unified engineering, yeah, I got a

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.930
lot from my ex, oh, I'm a specialist.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:47.850
Oh, I can't test my own stuff.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.690
I'm like, well, here's the deal.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:57.160
Um, you're welcome to not test your stuff, I guess, and let's, let's see what happens.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.800
But I'm, you know, no one's going to test it for you.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.570
And you know what?

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:07.330
Just takes a couple of mistakes and they realize, you know what?

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.210
I need to learn this.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:12.170
It didn't, it actually didn't take very long to get those other guys

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:18.970
aboard and realizing, so test has this problem of, you know, uh, we have this

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.850
fanciful, we're the defenders of the customer.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.410
Dev has their own thing, right?

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.090
I'm a specialist.

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:32.010
Who is, um, and it doesn't take long where, where things are so visible that

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:35.370
that's just like, you can't hold onto that belief anymore.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:40.280
And one thing, uh, worth bringing up here, it's got about five minutes left,

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:47.440
but, uh, as a force for continuous improvement, I've seen people fall into

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.880
the trap of trying to build a large, like test harness weeks of effort, maybe

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:57.440
months of effort to try and be a stopgap solution for something or to try and, you

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.760
know, really things to try and build a safety net versus help the team adapt

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:10.000
and optimize, uh, to me, adaptation, uh, works better when it's a shit ton of

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.320
tiny changes versus one big ass change.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.720
You can get a boiled frogs.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.120
There's lots of metaphors about this.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:23.050
And also in a culture of experimentation, applying that to improvement where, uh,

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:27.850
do frequent retrospectives try and, and actually I'll talk about retrospectives

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:28.610
for just a minute.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:34.170
I think, uh, many teams do retrospectives and they're, and they're a event session.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.290
Some teams do them and make a big list of things they want to improve.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:39.610
And none of them ever happened.

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:47.600
Uh, what I prefer and what I drive teams to do is do retrospectives as frequently

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.360
as you can handle, uh, minimum of once a week is what I, yeah, I, some of them

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.920
do too, I prefer once a week.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.160
Yeah.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:50:00.730
Prioritize the top one, maybe two, three at the most things you want to

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:07.560
improve and assign an owner, assign someone to be responsible for, for figuring out

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.280
what the micro improvement is and implementing it and coming back to

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.360
report to see what happens.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.400
Well, that didn't work.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.600
We can, we can learn from that.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.400
Try something else.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.080
Um, I do something similar.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.840
So every retrospective we do.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.120
So I do two styles of retrospective.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.080
One is, um, sort of a weekly retrospective.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.160
And we have another one known as the starfish model that we do once a quarter.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.800
The starfish model allows you to see sort of the long-term patterns, whereas

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.880
the weekly retrospective generally is very tactical.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:41.240
Right.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:49.260
But every retrospective ends with four bullets at minimum under two categories.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.400
What are two things that we're going to celebrate?

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.970
Hey, this really worked well.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.440
We very happy about this.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.320
And what are two things we're going to change and change starting tomorrow?

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.260
Yeah, I like that.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.540
And one thing I do, but didn't mention is you do celebrate, do you think about

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:14.380
the things you do well in addition to the improvements?

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.540
Well, it's important because you want to think about the whole system, right?

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.940
You don't want to change something because you see a negative impact and then,

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.140
and then neglect to think about it.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.260
You don't want something to go away because you've neglected it.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.660
You want to recognize that it's a good thing and keep it happening.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.420
Right.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.980
Besides retrospectives, what are some things, uh, we can do to some activities?

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.940
How else can we drive continuous improvement?

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:39.620
So you mentioned one thing that I'll, that I'll state, uh, continuous and

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.860
adaptive improvement is we haven't hit adaptation, I think enough in this

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:49.580
conversation, but, um, as you were talking about doing these small minor

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:56.140
changes, I actually even further recommend that you do it as vertical slices

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.340
through the whole architecture.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:58.500
Right.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:04.580
So a small vertical change through the whole architecture is better than, oh,

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.660
we're going to do one small release of this bit of the architecture.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:11.660
One small piece of this bit of the architecture, because it's as essentially

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:20.050
whatever is the experiential component of your system, that often is where the

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:23.330
money is in terms of understanding, are you delivering quality?

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:24.690
Do you need to adapt?

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:30.610
So the, so there is this tendency a lot of the times to overspend on

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:31.290
architecture.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:36.250
When I go through planning, I do planning in two month milestones and I

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:44.250
very specifically limit, I will spend no more than 30% of my funding on

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:50.660
architecture on just pure, we're going to, we're going to make the database faster.

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.420
We're going to refactor this thing.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.380
Cause that doesn't help you adapt.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:55.720
Right.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.000
Sure.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.760
You can argue, Oh, well, you know, two milliseconds is better than 10 milliseconds.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:01.640
Sure.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.120
Right.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.320
But right.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.600
But you know what?

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.520
Humans can't perceive less than a hundred milliseconds.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.120
So why do I care?

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.120
Well, maybe mere mortals like you.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.280
Sure.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.880
So I think chunking in vertical slices is also a good way of

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.040
doing, uh, continuous, uh, integration.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:22.640
Right.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.040
We probably could do half an episode just diving into applying

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.240
vertical slices in different ways, but we're not, yeah, we're not even

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.440
talking about like how you set up your, your, your GitHub instance.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:38.600
Cause there's another, you know, how you set up your project pipelines

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.160
also helps a great deal.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:40.600
Yeah.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.320
For sure.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:41.800
For sure.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.880
Oh, oh, here's one of my favorite ones on, on that particular one.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.240
You create a, your master tree.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:56.270
You let the business team, Hey, business team from here on out.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.070
Do you have PMs at unity?

00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:58.790
Yeah.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.510
Yeah.

00:53:59.590 --> 00:53:59.870
Okay.

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:07.400
So the PMs own telling the business team, what's the latest thing in master.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:08.420
Okay.

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:16.840
And engineering has no say in when any build from master releases.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.440
It's it's a pure business decision.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:27.520
So what that means is if engineering pushes to master, it better be good

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.760
because business can release it whenever they want.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:36.400
What that, and what that does is it, is it kind of forces on engineering.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.000
Hey, I don't know when they're going to release this thing.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.800
They can do anytime they want to.

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.640
I better make sure master is always clean.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.160
Master is always RTM.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.760
That sounds like the example of taking away a safety net.

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:50.770
It's taking away a safety net.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:52.690
It's continuous improvement.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.690
It's adaptation, but mostly taking away the safety net.

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:57.210
Yeah.

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.370
And the thing we're not going to be able to get into all the examples that

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.970
we're going to wrap up here, but there are literally hundreds, probably

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:07.570
thousands of ways they're all going to depend on context of ways to improve

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.770
the business as small, small, moving to smaller batch changes versus big

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:15.010
integration points, moving to trunk based development, moving, which is

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:16.450
similar to a model you're talking about.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:23.420
Those are all changes that will optimize your, your team.

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.460
And like I said before, you can't just go, okay, we're, we've been

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.660
doing big branches tomorrow.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.860
We're doing trunk based development.

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.580
One of the things we need to be able to do is figure out where we're going.

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.540
I want to go here.

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.340
What's what are the series of small steps I need to take to get there?

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.880
And that's super important and something probably worth elaborating on in the

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.680
future, but we're running close on time.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.520
Do you have any final words for the day, Brent?

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:50.640
None for the day.

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.200
None for today.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.880
We'll catch the rest tomorrow or in two weeks when the next

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.360
episode of AB testing comes out.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.800
Uh, one sec.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.080
Thank you for listening this far.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:55:59.880
We appreciate it.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.360
I hope we, uh, were able to answer some questions and not answer more

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.960
questions than we created regarding principle number three.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.800
That's always the goal of ours, but I don't know.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.720
I like the bag.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.720
I like to think it is.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.880
Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna have some serious mail baggage coming up.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.040
That's it.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.240
Brent has just like wave, like cut what?

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.240
Oh, we're at a time.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.960
This is the longest like end of episode monologue you have ever done.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.240
I told you I was tired.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:28.880
Okay.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.480
Um, I'm still not Brent and I am.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.120
Bye.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:32.440
Bye.
