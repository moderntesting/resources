00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.830
Kids, this is Alan.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.790
And this is Brent.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.310
Welcome to episode 31 of A, B, Testing.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.550
Hello, everyone.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.470
Hey, Brent, you know why I made that old man voice?

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.310
Yes, I do.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.520
Because I'm an old man.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.720
You know what?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.520
I don't feel a day over 50.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.840
Actually, I'll talk to you back.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.240
I feel exactly a day over 50.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.480
It's no fun if you pick on yourself

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.640
before I have a chance to.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.520
Preemptive picking.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.440
I had already planned to come in and announce

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.160
that a big event had occurred that I am now.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.240
So two days ago, I was, you were only 8% older than me.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.680
And now you're 11.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.240
So as far as I'm concerned, I got younger.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.960
Thank you.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.100
So is this a chapter out of How to Lie with Statistics?

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.740
Which is a very good book by the way.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.940
It is a fantastic book.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.330
And I don't think it's in there.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.810
All right, we'll add that too.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.570
It's How to Lie with Charts.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.250
Or maybe it's just Dumb Stuff, Brent says.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370
But yes, I turn 50.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.090
I share a birthday with the infamous Ozzy Osbourne.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.410
And someone else who came in.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.410
Holly Marie Combs from Charmed and Picket Fences

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.350
and some other shows.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.410
Oh.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.660
She didn't wish me happy birthday.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.190
I was hoping for a shout out, but nothing.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.070
I spent some time on History Channel's web page on a day

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.070
in history.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.590
I know.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.030
You had these stupid things like, oh, that one's been around

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.910
longer than the door transplant.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.620
Hopefully you're around long enough for a brain transplant.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.780
I did actually, though, the one on the Vietnam War,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.380
I did wonder, do you actually have any memories of it?

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.220
Yeah, I was there.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.300
I was what they called the young.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.640
So my dad, I don't even know if you know this.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.050
So my dad went into the Vietnam War, right handed,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.210
and came out left handed.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.410
He got hit by a mortar shell.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.730
OK, that's a trip.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.850
This is a downer, I know.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.490
But he got hit by a mortar shell,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.130
and he had half of his body paralyzed.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.530
Now, it's a great story.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.770
I grew up with this as a father.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.530
And one of the things my dad does,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.650
which has always been an inspiration for me,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.130
is he calls the rest of us two-handers.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.570
And ain't no two-hander going to be able to do something

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.930
he can't.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.930
My dad, he got dealt a really crappy deck of cards

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.930
and survived it.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.250
This all happened, obviously, before I was born.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.650
But I do know his timeline.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.670
And I'm like, hey, wait a minute.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.190
Alex, or not Alex, that's my son.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.950
Alan was four or five during that time period.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.350
I wonder if he has any memories at all of Vietnam.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.830
No?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.670
The answer is no.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.350
All right, then.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.790
Shall we do our topics?

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.390
We got some mailbag and some other stuff to talk about.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.790
Should I just jump right into my rant?

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.830
Go ahead.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.430
All right.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.590
I'm going to offend someone.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.150
But it wouldn't be the first time on A-B testing, right?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.390
No.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.030
Is it someone that actually listens to us?

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.590
No, I don't know, probably.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.810
So for full disclosure, I get the difference

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.730
between checking and testing.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.650
I also get that 99.9% of the software engineering world

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.650
uses the encompassing verb testing,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.230
Vrjarand testing, to describe things

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.200
that are technically checks.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440
And when I looked and I went and looked this up,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.360
and even the authors of checking versus testing

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.520
say that testing encompasses checking.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.480
Checking is a part of testing.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.120
So it just irks me to no end.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.560
Don't ever do this one of the three, or two of the three,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.080
or three of the three.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.600
None of y'all.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.760
Like when someone says, I wrote some automated tests,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.420
don't freaking get on Twitter and go,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.820
don't you mean you wrote automated checks?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.340
I've seen these.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.580
No, they wrote automated tests.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.780
They happen to be checking something that's fine.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.820
Just this incessant need to correct people's use

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.970
of the word test is not helping your cause.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.810
It's not.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.360
It's kind of like saying, hey, Alan, I just got a new puppy.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.040
And you coming back with, don't you

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.720
mean you got a German Shepherd?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.040
You're like, stop.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.610
Yeah, it's worse than that.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.530
It's worse than that.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.370
And then it gets worse.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.850
Somebody who doesn't even like me, I can handle it.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.410
And I'll flip it a little crap once in a while

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.210
because I get it.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.490
But somebody who doesn't even know what they're talking about.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.050
They see just random person happens

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.810
to mention the word testing when it could mean checking.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.570
And they get jumped all over.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.170
And then they make the argument of going,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.450
well, isn't this just semantics?

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.010
And they go, words are important to communicate our ideas.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.650
Words, we have to use the right words.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.570
And it's like, give me a break, people.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.490
You knew what they were talking about.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.850
It was totally clear to you what they were talking about.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.050
But you insisted on changing it so that only 1% of the world

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.250
would know what you were talking about anymore.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.890
I mean, ah, stop it.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.050
Just stop being an idiot.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.850
I am.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.610
So I am one of the people who will state words are important.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.210
And I probably have on multiple people.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.330
I completely agree that words are important.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:15.570
But what is not important is a Nazi-style activist correction,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.970
an active spell checker.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.810
Dude, now no one's paying attention

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.690
to the wisdom behind what you're saying.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.130
And they're just going, how do I get out of this meeting

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.450
with you, Douchebag?

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.970
Did you see my tweet yesterday, the day before?

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.930
Must have been the day before.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.370
But every morning, I load up Feedly,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.930
and I read through all my blog posts.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.530
And for some reason, I subscribe to people that piss me off.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.930
But often, even people that piss me off sometimes

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.930
say smart things.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.570
But anyway, I came across, I can't

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.170
remember who wrote it, so sorry.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.890
Another article about automated testing

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.330
and how we aren't really automated testing.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.370
You're automated checking.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.310
And testing can't be automated because testing

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.480
requires a human blah, blah, blah, same argument.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.240
And I tweeted, in the time it took me

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.120
to read an article saying that testing can't be automated,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.370
I could have wrote some automated tests.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.130
And most people got the irony of that,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.850
but I did have one person go, well,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.010
I think you're talking about checking.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.490
I don't get what you're saying.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.210
So please, just don't be thick about it.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.050
If you're one of the three, yes,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.970
it's good to recognize that there is verification

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.410
and investigation.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.770
And it's important that you have

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.970
that discussion with people.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.090
But randomly correcting people is just frickin' idiotic.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.210
So knock it off.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.890
Case closed.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.330
It is.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.450
My part of the case is closed.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.250
I'm ready to move on.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.770
No, it is.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.810
And I'm off this topic, but you just said something.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.570
So I saw your tweet, but it didn't interest me enough

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.450
to follow the conversation.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:56.090
But that was almost hurtful.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:02.120
The rabid wombat there.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.920
Wombat!

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.040
What was their definition of testing then?

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.960
What gets lost?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.040
And it's funny, I went back to the source.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.960
Why can't I automate testing?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.520
Because testing is a human activity

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.680
that requires judgment and intuition.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.840
And that can't be automated?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.560
No.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.020
Of course it can.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.100
Look, please don't make me go off into this hole.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.080
I went back to the source, and I verified that.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.560
And it's funny, when this thing first came out.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560
And me?

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.640
I said I always considered checking

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.120
to be a subset of testing.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.120
And later they said the same thing,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.200
which I don't think they listened to me at all,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.320
but it makes sense when he's being logical.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.360
So it's not one versus the other.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.880
Checking is part of testing.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.840
There's a part of testing that is simple verification.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.900
Boolean verification.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:08.410
But the followers of the model seem to think it's a versus.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.010
And they go to all ends to, it's almost like it's an agenda.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.810
It's just stupid.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.850
There are much more important things

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.370
to have semantic discussions about,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.690
agreeing that words are important.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.570
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.570
It's a good thing we only have three listeners,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.950
because I'm glad that we don't have

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.650
to deal with the problem of having polarized alkalite.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:31.770
You know, it's OK.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.450
Echo our words back to us.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.530
If we drop to two, it's cool.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.810
I'm just like, man, I would feel so responsible

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.730
if I had a bunch of, frigging, thoughtless disciples following

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.370
me around holding up this testing versus checking battle.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.890
Yeah.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:56.580
And it's from the same crowd that recognizes,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.540
rightfully, the power of critical thinking

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.340
and how important critical thinking

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.820
is for good testing, investigation,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.220
and actually for any knowledge work in general

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.940
to stay up on the soapbox.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.190
To not recognize it in this case, it's hypocritical.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.390
Completely agree.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:15.870
All right.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.570
So let's talk about something not from the soap.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.250
Actually, everything's from the soapbox, right?

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.210
Drent and I just had lunch.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.690
Oh, it was good.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.570
It was fantastic.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.930
Dintag Phong plus plus.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.090
All right.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.770
But we were talking over lunch about some of the challenges.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.370
Brent and I, Brent has been on Agile teams.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.770
He's helped teams transfer to Agile.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.450
And he's back on the horse again,

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.770
helping a team become, do adaptive software development,

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.290
being able to react to change.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.370
And we were kind of talking about the challenges that

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.530
happen, moving from a predictive or any sort of even

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:59.210
iterative software process to an adaptive process

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.690
or your data driven, you're driven

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.450
by the need for change versus needs for stabilization

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.250
periods, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.190
Ultimately, it comes down to, any time

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.630
there's an established system, it's really freaking hard

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.740
to change to a new established system.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.820
True.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.640
Right.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.520
So the challenge, right.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.240
I don't know if you've done much research on this.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.770
But do I look like I do research?

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.290
No.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.490
Yeah.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.250
You're too old.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.170
Even if you did, you'd forget it the next day.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.570
I got to be all kids.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.290
Did you see me tweet?

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:44.730
I got my application to apply for AARP in the mail.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.250
Booyah.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.770
Discounts.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.270
Out.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.850
Lunch is on Alan from here on out.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.650
Yeah, so I have a bunch of friends

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.090
who are Agile consultants, Agile coaches.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.130
I myself am a coach.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.280
And we spent a lot of time talking

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.000
about how do we help people do this transition.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.970
Because it is, quite honestly, almost all of these problems

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.210
come down to people problems.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.940
It's almost always cultural.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.020
Jerry Weinberg may have a quote about that.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.860
He does.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.650
The exact quote, actually.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.290
So the challenge that, so my particular team today,

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.540
there's a new challenge I've never faced.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:43.980
I have had the whole team running on a single board,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.060
which I'm very successful at getting.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.660
But in this particular case, there's also

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.500
five separate managers running.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:01.610
And all of these guys, they don't have a business first

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.210
mentality.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.670
They have a my business first mentality.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.380
And it is hard to get them to.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.220
Can you clarify what that means?

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.260
Or actually an example.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.700
So I think I know what you mean,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.300
but I don't want to jump down the wrong path.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.660
I'll give you an example.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.900
One of my peers today.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.340
And none of my team, actually.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.790
None of them are any of the three.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:33.830
An example today is, so those who follow Kanban,

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.190
you know that there's this process called limiting WIP.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:41.430
And we limit WIP, including what goes in the ready column.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.670
So we do a backlog grooming process every week.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.150
And we adjust this.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.310
But we have this thing called a swim lane or a rail

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.150
that we call the interrupt rail.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.990
So if something new comes up and it's not

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.950
time for the planning meeting, and you

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.870
need to get somebody started on something,

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.990
even though two days ago we just went through backlog

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.590
grooming, it happens in our space.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.150
We're an analytics team.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.350
So we have to operate at the speed at which decisions need

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:18.010
to be made, which is hourly at times.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.250
But this interrupt rail's purpose in life

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:26.200
is to limit how, to create a limit on how much our time can

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.830
be interrupted versus allowing the plan to move forward.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:36.540
Well, he had like five things he

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.530
wanted to put into the interrupt rail.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.470
And he wanted to understand, because he

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.450
has all of this pressure from other folks

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.410
to get this bug done, get this thing fixed,

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.010
get this stuff done.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:57.920
And he's missing the old days where he could just do bugs,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.480
allow bugs to get deferred, have a stabilization period in which

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.860
he fixes it.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.980
And the thing that he also wanted

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.420
was to increase the WIP on the interrupt

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.900
and be able to get his team.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.520
And he's like, I have two projects,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.300
and I have five people.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.660
So I need to get these guys moving forward.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.820
I have this huge urgency.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.540
Well, the thing is, is right now,

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.420
the planning phase, its purpose in life is we have commitments.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.900
So I think, do you follow the semester planning?

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.600
Are you in, if I said we're about to end sulfur,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.900
does that mean anything to you?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.400
Nope.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.260
OK.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:50.300
So most of CNE, and I believe also most of ASG,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.360
do six-month planning cycles at a division level.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.860
That ends in December.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.540
So there's still several team commitments

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.940
that my boss has made that we haven't accomplished.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.500
So what's happening, so I created a process

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.500
so which we could resource share and get

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.220
those goals accomplished.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.960
One of my peers, he has five open positions,

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.280
but he only has one person in it right now.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.750
And he's where things that we've committed

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.950
haven't gotten across the wire.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.960
Well, this peer I was talking to,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.980
he is more focused on what he has to deliver

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.800
versus what the team has to deliver.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.520
This is what I mean by the business priority versus my.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.130
It's like 17 on the list.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.150
And we're back.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.610
I made Brent stop partway through

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.130
because my audio equipment was being mean.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.550
The signals are a lot better now.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.590
I'm not sure how the first half of this podcast

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.370
is going to sound.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.350
Yeah, we're good now.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.630
We have normal levels now.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.790
Brent was getting smaller and smaller and disappeared.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.670
And we tried a bunch of things, and I just

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.130
plugged into a different USB port on my Lenovo laptop.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.310
And we're good to go now.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.150
Wow.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.650
All right.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.240
Were you testing or checking your equipment?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240
OK.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.800
I am really worried now that the first half of our podcast

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.660
is going to sound like poo.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.620
Because now I have actual levels that make sense.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.340
I can always adjust them later.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.620
You want to start over and just make this one a shorty?

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.740
No, I don't want to start over.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.820
We'll make it work.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.540
So I may just publish in the second half.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.940
So when we last left off, Brent was babbling,

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.060
talking about transitioning from predictive to adaptive.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.100
And take it away, Brent.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.220
Yeah.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.900
I'm not going to go.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.180
Am I doing that all over again?

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.900
No.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.220
OK, God.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.450
OK.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.100
Yeah, it's hard.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.580
All right.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.460
Next subject.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.300
I think we've talked a lot about organizational changes.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.020
I'm not going to dive deep into that.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.140
But it's tough for people to see.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.020
There's two things in play here.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.460
One is that it's easy to go back to what

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.780
you're comfortable with.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.420
Yep.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.100
And that's one of the harder things, fighting inertia.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.780
The effort that people see the value.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.100
For me, when I see teams get to that stage where

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:20.440
they can truly be just adaptive, and it's fun.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.160
Oh, it's fantastic.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.360
I think it's motivating.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.600
Because I go to the Dan Pink research on people

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.920
are motivated by progress, by seeing progress.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.760
And you get to see so much of that.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.160
And you don't, without a lot of the roadblocks

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.760
that come with debt.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.640
But negative motivations almost always overpower positive.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.720
And in this particular example, any place

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:50.560
where the hardest part for doing this transition for leaders

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.280
is to recognize that you will be happier.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.320
You will have a more productive team

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.890
if you let go of command and control.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:06.640
If you let your team decide, they're better suited.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.700
They're better able.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.380
And the facilities that we put in place

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.340
to allow you to prioritize or influence

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.880
what they have to choose between are enough.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.160
Right.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.640
There's a Steve Denning quote that I'm

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.360
sure I've mentioned to you 50 times.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.440
But from his book, The Leader's Guide to Radical Management.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.280
Give people a framework they can work in

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.680
and then get out of their way.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.560
Yeah.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.240
I love that.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.640
I give them just enough one minute manager

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.320
apply, swoop in, and give them coaching when they need it.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:35.960
But get out of their way.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.080
Let people make decisions.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.200
They're actually better right than you think they are.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.400
It occurs to me.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.270
It occurs to me just now what exactly is going on.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:49.640
What's going on is there's a bunch of people

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.340
who are in leader roles, but there aren't leaders.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.920
They're managers.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.020
I don't know if that insight helps me solve this problem.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.420
Brant, if there weren't hard problems for us to solve,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.500
we wouldn't be employed.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.980
I have plenty of other interesting problems

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:14.620
to solve than polling people from 1998 into 2015.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.060
Yeah, that is a challenge.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.860
We are in 2015.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.780
One of the things.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.660
For a few more weeks.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.360
So for a few more weeks, 2015, we're

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.640
going to pull the team to a safe model in March.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.120
That's right.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.360
You're safe certified.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.480
I am.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.320
I'm going to take them to safe, which is for a team our size.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.960
Safe really works well for 50 plus.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.240
Again, we're half that.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.870
It's overkill.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:53.240
But I'm going to test because I suspect that the safe model will

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.400
strike a balance between how the managers want

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.400
to use command and control and create

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.440
a predictive environment.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.280
This will allow them to be predictive in three month

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.240
cycles.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.920
All right.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.080
I haven't done this in a while.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.040
And I don't know if I can do it in my second half

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.880
of my century on this planet.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.950
But I'll try it.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.930
Mailbag.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.410
That was actually better than you usually did.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.730
I was expecting the fact that we just came back from lunch

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:34.290
and trying to fight lunch coma would have slowed you down.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:34.890
But it didn't.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.930
No.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:44.570
So Alan, we have at least three mailbag questions

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.450
and one handy tip.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.050
OK.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.190
I want to talk about the first question.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:56.830
Alan sent out to the three, hey guys,

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.830
we're going to do two more.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.670
Any questions?

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.320
And one of the questions that came back,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.810
why are you guys so great?

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:10.470
And the answer is, is there an answer?

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.870
Because I don't think we're particularly great.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.430
I said in Twitter, we're not.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.430
Could there have been sarcasm there?

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.780
Perhaps.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.980
OK, next question.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.020
We do take all questions and address them in our podcast.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.240
We don't always give insightful answers.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.480
We will answer.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.200
We will answer with something.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.360
So I went to private school when I was younger.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.800
Southern Baptist religious school.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.520
And I remember my teacher.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.320
So much is coming to light all of a sudden.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.040
I remember my teacher saying, God answers all questions.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:57.900
He either answers yes, no, or not going to answer right now.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.700
And I'm like, magic eight ball at least has eight answers.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:08.020
OK, now we pissed off two of the three.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.460
Let's go on.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.660
Did you see the one Twitter?

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.420
I heard the one hashtag.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.540
Yeah, tweet one of the seven of the three.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.700
Yeah, I thought that was cool.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.620
That was from test.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.460
Pappy.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:18.980
Yes.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.220
Who I met at Eurostar.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.660
One of the seven of the three.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.860
One of the seven of the three.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.700
I like them.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.970
So let's talk a little bit more about the I

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.210
don't think any team company outside of Microsoft

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:37.290
uses this term, but the term often used at Microsoft

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.050
is combined engineering.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:39.890
Yep.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:46.340
Meaning it's a software team without a dedicated test team.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:46.980
So what is that?

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:52.740
And did you watch there was a talk at a local QA SIG

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.300
recently with someone who used to work at Microsoft.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:55.900
Yep.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.420
I don't know.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:56.820
Jamie Campbell.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.780
Yeah, I knew Jamie is worked in office.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.500
And then I looked at the slides and I watched most of his talk

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.940
and I think there's some things we can touch on.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.260
But did you do either of those?

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.340
I did both.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.180
Look at you.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.140
Yeah.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.880
I would say in first ever dual prepared A-B testing podcast.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.160
I'm so uncomfortable using the P word here.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.560
Podcast.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.720
Prepared.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.360
Oh.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:31.180
Yeah, so there was when I was going through it,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.540
first I thought it was a challenge

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.700
because there was massive glare on the monitor.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.180
Right.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.140
I had to follow along on the slides outside.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.300
I couldn't see the slides in the broadcast at all.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.780
I was hunting around the QA SIG's website

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.780
and I was halfway through the recording

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.420
before I finally found the slides.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.420
And then I just went, oh, sure.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.940
That's what he was talking about there.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.860
There was only one place where I thought

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.060
I was going to disagree with Jamie.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.640
And then he came the very next slide.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.680
You started talking about his view.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.720
And I'm like, yeah, that's very much the lines.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.240
Yeah.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.280
And it was really more of his experience

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.280
on his team going through a move to combined engineering.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.840
It's very similar.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.040
Not only were they moving to combined engineering,

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.480
but they were moving away from predictive development models

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.120
towards adaptive.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.480
And it's important.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.120
And I said this before.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.320
I'll say it again.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.600
And one of the things I didn't like in his combined

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.640
engineering slides is why move because it's trendy.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.320
And yeah.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.120
I didn't get the Taylor Swift metaphor in his slides.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.000
The point is you don't do anything

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.960
because other people are doing it because it looks fun,

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.280
because it's cool.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.120
You want to, if you're going to make a change,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.360
have it be for a reason.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.240
And I think it's the other way around.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.680
We want to be more adaptive.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.680
And because of that, it makes sense

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.760
for us to do a unified engineering team

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.160
because it lets us be adaptive in these ways.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.050
Now, we just talked about that.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.770
Maybe I don't know if I actually got to a point on it.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.540
Rarely.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.060
Rarely.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.520
Why do we want to be adaptive?

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.960
We want to be able to react to what customers want and need

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.160
faster.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.450
Why?

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.770
We didn't have to do that before.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.050
Why do we have to do that now?

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.250
Because now, if they're not getting what they want from us,

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.930
they have many other choices.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.970
People are much more fickle in their choices

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.610
of web services, web providers, apps, et cetera.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.410
If you don't give them what they want, you've lost them.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.370
Yeah.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:41.640
I can try out, pick any popular thing right now.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:48.280
And I could try out free trials of that thing, 15 to 20 of them

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.320
in a span of three hours.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.600
One of those guys are going to have the recipe

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.960
that I'm looking for.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.720
Yeah.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.160
You will lose.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.400
Sometimes, even if it's something that they don't absolutely

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.000
need, like if they're a word processor,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.480
I probably need a word processor.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.800
And I don't like Word.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.880
Used to be I could wait for the next version of Word.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.680
Now I have lots of other open source and freely available

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.800
alternatives.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.720
But there may be something like maybe a game

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.000
where they don't need it.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.840
And they might not even be an alternative.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.720
But if you're not giving them value

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.880
and reacting to what's working and what's not working

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.190
with them quickly, they're going to stop using your game.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.190
Not for a competitor, not for another product.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.390
People could stop using what you're making just

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.910
because it doesn't get them enough value or pleasure

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.350
or fun or whatever.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.950
Yeah, some games have competitors.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.470
Like we talked about League of Legends last time.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.030
Some games don't.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.590
But it's the second.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.510
The point is, in the world today with apps

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.510
and the world living on the web, you

00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:00.030
have to be adaptive to make software today.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.870
This might be too harsh to say, but the world in general

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.630
today has ADHD.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.510
They're fickle.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.670
And if you don't keep them engaged,

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.470
they're not going to come back.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.710
And we shouldn't say the world because there's

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:21.730
telecom and military software that doesn't need to be adaptive.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.090
Telecom?

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.850
I don't know about telecom, but I'll

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.010
go with the military one.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:27.530
OK, fine.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:28.410
I'll do that one.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.650
I think if the FCC lifted limitations,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.490
what made it easy for people to switch from Comcast

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.050
to Xfinity to Frontier.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.650
Isn't Comcast, Xfinity, the same thing?

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.010
It is, yes.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.490
So maybe not those two.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.010
Yeah.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:51.790
But if it was easy to switch back and forth, people would.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.830
Yeah, one thing, getting back to Jamie's thing,

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.150
and combined engineering in general.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.270
So the mailbag item, to be clear, the mailbag item

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:07.560
was around, hey, what is the efficacy of combined engineering?

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.880
And to me, the biggest one, I'll

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.040
get back to Jamie's thing in a second.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.600
To me, the biggest thing is what I call the,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.240
I think I've acted on that before,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.440
the ping pong game.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.400
The ping pong game of, here's my code.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.990
Here's a bug.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.070
Here's the fix.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.550
Here's another bug.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.670
Here's some more code.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.630
Here's two more bugs.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:33.080
That back and forth and back and forth, very inefficient.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:38.030
And I'll say it in a different light.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.250
The world has ADHD.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.330
Therefore, we have to adapt to keep the world engaged.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:50.240
Therefore, calendar time, calendar time, not effort

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.400
calendar time, calendar time is one of our single most

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.800
competitive assets.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.320
Things that waste calendar time, such as bug ping pong,

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.040
such as stabilization, throwing over the walls,

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.970
such as stabilization.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.010
Particularly in the world, when there's

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.970
a whole massive community of people

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.250
who have successfully shifted and have

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:23.440
learned how to produce better software, in that world,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.880
combined engineering is a necessity.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.160
I think so.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.760
Although I also hate the word.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.360
I've always been fine with it.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.160
And once you introduce me to unified engineering,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.560
I like that better.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.620
Glad I have an influence on you.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.460
In terms of, well, go back to Jamie's.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:48.460
One thing I did, one kind of orange flag, yellow flag,

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.060
he was talking about their move.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:55.160
And some of the testers moved to development roles.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.120
Some moved to data roles.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.520
Data analyst, 50% moved to dev roles.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.240
And he didn't say this directly.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.200
But I was worried that in that transition that they lost.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.240
One thing I think is critical in unified engineering

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.910
is that although the specific roles may go away,

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.790
the activities still need to happen.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.190
And I was worried that he made it

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:30.240
sound like all the testing expertise was being forgotten.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.920
And I think it's important when you do unified engineering

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.920
for that efficacy to work.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.560
And I said this before, he permucated a million times,

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.480
is that you don't build a team where everybody

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.680
does the exact same thing.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.560
Everybody owns quality and code soup to nuts.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.520
Some people are going to be better at some parts.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.980
And you want to optimize for the team you have.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:52.940
To some degree.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:32:01.100
And so your orange flag kind of backs into my orange flag.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.940
Because one of the things he talked about,

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.060
his first slide, it was towards the end of his deck.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.140
And I think it was titled, specialists are great.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.740
And I cringed.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.260
I was just like, oh.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.940
But the next slide he was talking about,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.740
but specialists need to learn.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.970
So he delivered the same message.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.330
He was dancing around specializing generalists.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.090
And generalizing specialists.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.610
He took it from a different angle.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:31.250
But that's what he was saying.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.650
Because the problem with specialists

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.170
is they're a bottleneck.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.080
They can only do what they can only do.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.720
Now, if they're in a business where what they can only do

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.800
is what's really valued, then fine.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.600
It makes sense.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.520
But the problem is when you get into a place where

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.290
what they can really do is not what the business needs

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.130
from them, then you end up, much like what

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.130
I was saying before, the problem on my current team,

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.480
you end up focusing on the local optimization.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.720
And that's not what's valuable.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.960
It's not how you bring out the maximum value out of the team.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.680
In a world where you have to aggressively compete

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.720
for people's attention.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.920
I like that you brought up bottlenecks in general.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.200
Because when I think I go back to five minutes

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.040
in our conversation, going back to figure out

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.040
what you want to do first, and then figure out why,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.840
figure out what you have to do to get there.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.200
Don't start just by doing something.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.560
You can even go back farther.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.560
And if the goal is not never, should

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.020
be we want to ship every day.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.780
That can be something you do.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.540
The goal should be we want to get frequent value

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.260
to our customers.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.220
So in order to do that, we're going to give them

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:53.580
a new build every day that has higher quality and more value.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.230
So every day, every day better.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.070
What is the most, I'm trying to reword,

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.110
what is the most value we can deliver every day?

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.270
Yeah, and maybe you do that.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.910
So then you think, well, what are the bottlenecks that

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.030
stop the screen in there?

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.870
We can't do a stabilization period.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.910
How do we get away from that?

00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:11.070
We'll fix bugs.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.510
There's a bunch of things you can do.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.910
And don't optimize them all.

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:17.310
Figure out what's the biggest bottleneck.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.110
Optimize that.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.270
Figure out how to get rid of that.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.510
And it could be the specialist.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.820
Well, we can't ship until our performance specialist

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.030
gives it his once over, and that takes two hours.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.350
Well, how can we spread that out?

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.190
Well, what does he do?

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.030
Yeah, exactly.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.590
Maybe we can spread that out.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.270
But there's a huge number of things that have to happen,

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:37.110
or that happened.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.230
Figure out, and maybe that's fine until the day he's sick.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.510
So there's probably a better solution there.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.310
But I really like the idea of just,

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.350
let's figure out what's the biggest bottleneck.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:46.950
Address that.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:47.910
Then go on to the next one.

00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:50.330
You don't need to do a bunch of stuff at once.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.130
Figure out what you're trying to do.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.850
Figure out what's the biggest detriment

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.370
from letting you do that.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.370
Fix that.

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:57.890
And then reevaluate.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.210
It occurs to me.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.090
Thinking about what I just said,

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.850
where the single most precious thing on any team,

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.250
no matter how big or small you are, is calendar time.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.290
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:14.030
It's not effort, calendar time.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.750
And what you're really trying to do

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.600
is maximize the equation, ROI per calendar time.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.580
Yeah.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.040
Multiple ways of doing that.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.200
But bottlenecks, people who, you know,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.360
single points of failure,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.000
all of these things slow you down.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.400
I have one guy.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.080
So I used to be the scrum master of my team.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.200
I recently hired a guy to my team

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.080
that he followed me from my last team

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.010
and he took over while it was there.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.570
And I've said, you know what, I want you to do this.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.450
I want you to fight broken window theory.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.490
And I want you to stick to the rules

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:54.610
and be ever persistent.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:58.690
My job is going to be to spend less time

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.250
than I had been, but to make sure

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.090
you're sticking to the rules.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:02.970
Okay.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.850
And one of the things he just realized, it's Friday,

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.450
and one of the rules he has to do

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.890
is the work always has to move forward.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.890
And so he noticed one of the rails we have on our board

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.330
is out of office.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.370
And it's that time of the year

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.480
where people are disappearing.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.200
He's like, okay, there's this big machine learning

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.760
conference for two days here in Washington

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.520
that half of my team is going to.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.160
He's like, okay, just a reminder,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.440
the work still has to go even though,

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.960
move forward even though you're gone.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.800
So either you guys got to complete it

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.310
or hand it off by end of the day today.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.150
Why would he take that approach?

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.030
Certainly the work could wait two days.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.870
Right?

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.630
Well, it was because no, it can't.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.910
Calendar time is a single most precious asset.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.430
The work has to move forward.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:57.590
I truly believe in one of the mantras

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.030
I've done on this team is, you know,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.430
we released to our production server

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.630
only goes to some internal people.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:06.590
But we go through a nice promotion process to get there.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.780
And it's like better, better quality,

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.300
more value every week.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.860
Eventually that'll be every day,

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.380
but it's incremental.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.380
If it's a little better every week or every day,

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.740
just a little tiny bit over the course of weeks

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:24.540
and months in a year, it ends up getting hugely better.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.380
So I like the idea of always forward

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.240
even because calendar time doesn't stop.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.080
Yeah, I get it.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.900
I like it.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.260
I will say, so specifically to the question,

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.340
like the efficacy of combined engineering,

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.020
much like Alan's favorite answer is it depends.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.860
If you recognize and view it

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.700
and implement the change strategy

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.020
as if the change of combined engineering

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.740
is a system change,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.940
then it will work and it's fantastic.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.420
If you do it as, hey, all combined engineering means

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.300
is Dev and tests are working together.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.220
So we'll just incorporate tests into the dev team.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.700
And that's all you viewed the change is.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.300
It's a living nightmare.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.060
Yeah, there's lots of ways to screw it up, right?

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.380
Oh, it's very easy to screw it up.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.900
You could say, I could do a whole podcast

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:17.820
to get a dumb ways to do it.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.900
So we could say, I have a team of 10 people

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.260
on a combined engineering team.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.220
And every week, half of those people will be the testers

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.560
and they're, we'll do a two week sprint.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.520
And maybe, oh, I know, two weeks,

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.360
they have to be testers.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.180
That's one way.

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.360
Another way was we do a two week sprint

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.200
and we'll develop features for the first half

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.000
and then test them in the second half.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.380
And then we'll fix the bugs in the third half.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.220
I don't know.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.600
I have to think through these bad ideas.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.320
Don't do those.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.680
Actually, the first one I was thinking through.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.240
So if you did, you had 10 people on the team, right?

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.680
And you find some way like,

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.080
hey, the last character of your name, mod two.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.280
If you're odd, if you're a zero or one,

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.760
you'll rotate back and forth.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.560
I'm like, that actually could work.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.400
Yeah.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.240
If there was some rotation.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.480
Careful, careful.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.680
If there were test activities, you wanted to, yeah.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.520
Right.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.600
But yeah, no.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.670
The typical, the typical strategy that is happening

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.630
is big changes like this.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:24.000
People are trying to minimize change

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.070
instead of trying to maximize the goal,

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:34.540
then minimize the change that achieves the goal.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.620
Though what happens with these changes,

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.740
where it can go arise when you think

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.300
that the change is the goal.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.140
Right.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.820
Yeah, it's kind of what I was saying before.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.260
Don't just focus on what the change is.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.280
Focus on what you're doing.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.900
You're doing these things for a reason.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.740
And it's lost a lot of times in these changes.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.580
Oh, we're being agile.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.400
Why?

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.810
We're doing combined engineering.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:57.630
Why?

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.470
Because it's trendy.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.190
No, you're doing it for a reason.

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.030
Yeah.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.870
And if you don't know what the reason is.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.450
And the team has to know what that reason is

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.380
because otherwise you're never going to get them bought in.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.300
Right.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.260
And you even still may not.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.060
Because people, and I think I've brought this up

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.540
on the podcast before.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.860
People, there was a study done years ago,

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.620
people are more afraid of change than death.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.340
Right.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.700
It was change, death, and public speaking.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.340
Right.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.420
You have to push change forward.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.580
But you have to acknowledge that there's a fear,

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.660
that there will be resistance.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.340
And you have to sort of.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.020
And that's the leadership part of that.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.480
There's tactical parts of this which we talked about.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.260
But there's that leadership part of making sure there's

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.940
a path that works for everyone.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.460
Yeah.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:55.440
And we've talked about the last podcast as well.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.000
I stand by this.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.090
I do think natural boring system thinkers are rare.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.210
Perhaps.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.410
I am a developer.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.850
Why do I have to worry about training this tester?

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.760
I don't want to just be writing code.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.630
You know what?

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.310
Yeah.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:12.710
I get it.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.150
I get it.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.590
Hey, let's give me back two of your ladder levels

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.470
and you can do that.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.970
Fine.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:18.470
Are they called?

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.110
They're not really called ladder levels anymore.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.790
I don't know what the hell they are.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.110
I think you're older than I am.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.790
I think your birth certificate is wrong.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.350
Let's do Vernon's tip and get out of here.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:28.740
What was Vernon's tip?

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.740
Oh.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.700
So apparently you didn't see it?

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.200
I did.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:33.700
I did.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.420
I was giving you a bad time.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.380
So the deal is that, and it's too late now.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.380
So now at the end of the podcast,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.860
the tip of the day is when you start listening to this

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.540
podcast, keep the volume on low.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.540
Yeah.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.780
It's a little lob.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:54.760
Maybe if you can hear that we have fire engines outside.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.520
Because we're on the 20th floor with double pane windows

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.970
and we can hear them.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:59.650
Yeah.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:00.570
All right.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:01.410
Hey, everybody.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.090
I'm 50-year-old Alan.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.730
And I am not.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.840
I am 11% younger Brent.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.880
See you later.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.760
Bye, guys.
