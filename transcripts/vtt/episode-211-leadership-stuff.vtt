00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.300
Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.440
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.040
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.180
Now, on with the show.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.280
I just did an interpretive dance for Brent.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.280
Yes.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.310
The intro.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.390
And it was a sarcastic interpretive dance.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.390
No.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.470
And I'm like, you know, it may be time for Alan to record a new version of that.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.750
You just didn't know.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.150
You just didn't know what it was all about until now.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.110
When I originally made that, that's exactly what I did.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.150
I documented the choreography and that is what it is.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.150
Welcome to AVE Testing.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.150
I'm Alan.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.150
I'm Brent.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.750
Brent's the other guy over there, generally stinky, is what we call him.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.750
It's a long story.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.330
We talk about that on a previous podcast.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.470
Our producers will look that up for you and let you know we don't have any producers.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.950
So you get us.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.710
Brent, how have you been?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.830
It's review time.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.830
So yet there's that.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.030
Start off with a good pick me up.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.110
Does Microsoft still do the connects things?

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.110
Like, is that a thing?

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.110
Good.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.110
That's good.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.790
They were done poorly when I was there, but I do like the idea of check-ins multiple

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.110
times per year.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.870
So, it's tell me.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.870
Tell me what's on your...

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.710
The Connect has a look of pain, disgust, angst, and a slight bit of horror on his face.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.430
Please tell me what you're thinking.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.380
The connects, when we started at Microsoft, right?

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.380
They weren't connects.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.180
They were reviews.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.980
And then there was an easy one and then there was the one that sucked.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.980
Yep.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.980
Right?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.260
Then the Connect thing came in and said, hey, we found out through studies slash experience

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.460
slash experimentation.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.180
Slash people leaving.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.940
That checking in more frequently is better.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.820
Oh my God.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.820
Right?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.820
What?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:30.980
And then they're like, oh, and since you're checking in more frequently, right, you should

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.700
do this and you should do that and you should do this and manage this Microsoft message.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.340
And so now it has kind of slowly creeped back into what it was.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.340
So that's unfortunate.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.340
And so...

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.340
Welcome.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.340
Welcome, great cat to the E.E.N.E.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.340
and it's a podcast.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.060
My dog was crying on the floor a minute ago.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.660
She'll probably cry again.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.180
So let me...

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.380
Let's talk about that for a minute.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.260
We can get back to what's been going on.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.340
And maybe this is the whole podcast of the topic, topic of the podcast.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.940
I don't know.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.940
But Review Season Interesting.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.940
Wait, can you do that?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.520
No.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.580
Oh, I did that.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.580
Nice little purr into the microphone.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.580
That was great.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.580
That was great.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:28.500
So, current employer, NBC Universal, has one performance review a year, which I find not

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.560
good.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.560
It's hard.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560
Well, what happens?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.960
Let's talk about what happens when you have one performance review a year.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.960
And this is documented.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.680
It goes back to the whole reason that the connect in the first place is...

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.640
And plus, a bunch of researchers come out and say, boy, does it put a whole lot of pressure

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.540
and anxiety around that performance review.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.220
And again, if you're managing stuff well and you're remembering to give people feedback

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.220
and talking to them about what's going on and remembering the mantra of no surprises

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.570
at review time, it can be okay.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.970
But it puts a lot of pressure on the manager to remember to do that.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.210
And again, it's the manager's job and they should.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:21.680
So given that my philosophy of work is to, again, align on the goals of the organization

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.120
and what we need to get done.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.840
I do whatever the fuck I want.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.360
And so in this case, my team, I told them that for a couple of reasons, once a year is just

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.600
not cool until we get better at giving feedback and remembering to care about this stuff because

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.440
it's really easy to fall into that trap of managing the work for the people.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.000
So we do four times a year.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.520
We have the main one in Feb.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.440
Then every three months, we have...

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.440
I just don't...

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.600
There's no documentation.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600
There's no...

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.240
I don't check follow up, but I do it with my directs.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.000
And so I think by modeling, they do it farther.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.160
It's have a career discussion.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.560
Have a discussion around whether it's...

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.080
And it can be different every time.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.440
I didn't mind different, but have a deeper discussion around hopes and dreams.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.440
Have a deeper discussion around feedback.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.030
Have a discussion around really tying purpose to the work, going back to Dan Pink.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.270
And that does two things.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.010
One, it's better for the manager to get used to giving that feedback.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.170
Maybe it's the same thing to two different angles.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.250
It normalizes getting feedback.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.370
It normalizes having that more serious discussion.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.810
It normalizes having one-on-ones that aren't just about status reports, which I freaking

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.930
hate.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.810
So it brings a lot of value and practice in that, especially I have some new managers

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.250
on the team.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.610
It helps them learn how to manage better in the long run.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.010
It's very low key.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.730
Again, no requirements, but just getting folks to have those conversations is really important

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.730
to me.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.890
Did we bring over the Unity questions?

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.890
No.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.690
And the Unity questions went away.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.690
Oh.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.810
Why is your job...

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.730
Well, actually, indirectly.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.730
Why is your job?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.410
Why is it important?

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.410
What have you done?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.410
Something like that.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.810
I think it was with the Unity questions.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.810
But I like that.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.300
We had three queues, three questions, three times a year.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.980
What I've done, and again, first perf review was in last Feb that I was a part of.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.980
So we've done...

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.580
This is our third set since then.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:30.620
We're going to do November career discussions, and then we'll have the big gnarly scary one

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.260
in February.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.340
But I usually put a little bit of framing around each of them.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.860
This one is, let's have a discussion around tying purpose to your work.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.260
So this really goes back to that first question.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.140
Why is your job important?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.720
How does what you do support the goals of the company?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.380
Last time it was more around where do you want to go in your career and what are the

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.420
skills that I need to find an opportunity for you to practice in order to get there?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.540
And those are things that come up.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.660
I document all this in our shared Slack channel.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.620
And it just...

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.400
To me, it's real easy to get caught up, especially in our world where there's a lot

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.900
of cognitive load due to far too many things going on at once.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.540
Taking a little bit of time every three months.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.340
And of course, there's reflection that comes after that.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.860
It gives us a basis for future discussions.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.760
But just to have a more serious discussion around, let's just take a step back from

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.820
all of the daily bullshit.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.020
Let's just talk about you and your career, why it's important, where you want to go.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.100
Let's just make sure we're aligned on that.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.940
And then we'll go back to the daily bullshit going forward.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.180
But we have a conversation and some documentation on that that we keep, that we can use

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.180
to refer to.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.700
And we go, hey, I have an opportunity that I think will help you do this thing we

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.380
talked about two months ago.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.780
What do you think?

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.620
So to me, yeah, go ahead.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.300
I think that's fantastic.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.220
That's because you love me, Brent.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.020
I do love you.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.180
Well, love, love.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.180
Yeah.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.180
You know what?

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.180
It's all the same.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.300
For the people in my life, I'm good with tolerate.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.860
It's mine.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.020
I know who I am.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.020
I know what I do.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.020
It's OK.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:22.620
Yeah, no, it's I realized the other day that at some point in time, just in the last couple

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:31.540
of years, I have shifted into that that age where you go, I'm fucking old and I no longer

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.540
give a fuck.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.020
Right.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.980
It's just like, yeah, this is who I am.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.660
If you don't like it, great.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.580
Like, don't talk to me about it.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.380
Don't waste any further of my time.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.380
Right.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.380
Yeah.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:45.900
You know what?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.420
I'm older than you and I'm not there.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:55.860
Sometimes I don't give a shit, but actually, 95 percent of the time I do.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:01.900
And I forget how old I am because I feel so young at heart and I feel like I have so

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.220
much more in me, but also the calendar says otherwise.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.440
Well, there is.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.360
So what I described is sort of like my home persona at work.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360
Right.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.460
The one of the problems and I do still go into work at least three days a week.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.460
Right.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:29.420
And one of the problems at work is you're surrounded by these 20 something to 30 somethings.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:37.560
And it's just natural for for you to forget you're not the same age as everyone that's

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.560
around you.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.140
Right.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:48.620
So until things like, oh, yeah, he's basic and totally simping on so and so.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.570
And I'm like, what the hell did you just say?

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:04.500
It's I'm going to be at a loss in four years when when when my last teenager finally

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.060
leaves home and I lose my ability to it in near real time, interpret the quote unquote

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.100
English around me.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:21.280
Now, going back to your topic, I think that's that's very base to be a brand.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.240
Thanks. I I think it would be fantastic.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:38.530
So one of the reasons why Microsoft created the more frequent feedback program right was

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.770
because they did the research and they found that it was the benefit.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:54.560
OK, but the problem is if the people who have to execute it don't understand the benefit

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:02.880
or or worse don't care, there are seeing that there are far too many managers and far too

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.480
fewer leaders in management positions.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.760
I had a conversation about this earlier.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.680
So you are on to something because this is true.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.080
Up and down at Microsoft over the years.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:22.600
But as you know, managing people, being a manager is a whole different job than being a

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.920
frontline engineer.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.350
Yes. And being a manager of managers is a whole different job.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:35.590
Yeah. And we put people into these roles and rather than give them coaching and

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.630
training and the skills that they need to be successful, instead, we give them a

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.790
handshake and good luck.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.470
So Microsoft, we now do a whole crapload of training.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.510
OK, well, good for you.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.030
So now, so tell me about this because I think that's important.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.270
It is important. And I don't know if that training is tactical or it's around like the

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.430
growing humans part, which I feel oftentimes is missing in business.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.950
But please go on because you want to talk.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:14.340
Yeah. The way I would interpret the training is there.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.010
Like the coaching habit.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.250
OK, that was required training and that was fantastic.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:32.960
And the reason why it was fantastic is because within the training is part of

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.160
training people. Why?

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.720
Why you as a manager care, right?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.000
It's creating that intrinsic motivation.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.420
But that type of training is super rare.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:54.420
If you don't care beforehand, like you're it's you're going to come up or you're going

00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:00.890
to view it as this is an action that legal is forcing on us.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.010
Right. Or HR.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:09.530
And well, what do you think about checking on this stuff before someone comes a manager?

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.560
Like I and you see this happen.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.800
It happens a lot less now, given that there are generally fewer manager roles growing,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.920
as there were like years ago when they were booming.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.120
But a lot of times people would want to take on management for no other reason than

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.560
they felt like it was a promotion.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.320
Yeah. And how do we.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.800
So maybe there's a little bit of work we need to do.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.760
And I'll talk about how I've been this in the past, but I'm going to put it to you

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.160
first. How do you figure out if people are becoming managers for the right reason and

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.120
making sure those people go into management because they want to eventually,

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.360
the pinnacle, according to Maxwell, grow more leaders.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:56.120
Ah, I have a very high bar for for someone who wants to be a leader.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.140
Tell me.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.080
Or manager.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.720
And it's essentially OK.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:10.200
Let me give you let me give you my short speech and I have another mitigation as well

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.240
around promotions.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.670
Because I am not trying to construct managers.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.680
I'm trying to construct leaders and the leaders who I will put into a management

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.930
position. Honestly, my heuristic is do they want the job?

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.730
And if the answer is no, that's my first bar.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.690
Well, OK.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.410
Then I'm going to ask that I want to know why.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.890
So no, it's just the first step.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:46.480
But if if the answer is no, and the reason why is because of a sense of responsibility,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.720
that they're going to be in a position that could potentially screw up a bunch of

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.640
people and their families, that's exactly the person I want in that role.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:58.680
Good.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.200
It's one that recognizes the importance of the role.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.760
It's so important to check.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.800
And I want to go back to, again, the three things that Gallup over years of

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.200
surveys has shown have the most to do with employee engagement.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.360
Feedback.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.080
Know why your job is important and know your manager cares about you.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.920
So if you can get an idea of someone's going into management because we can coach

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:29.600
on feedback, but you but they care about what someone's career looks like.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.600
Give them the feedback and coaching and guidance to get there and tie purpose to

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.240
their work.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.240
If there's interest in those things, they're probably going to be pretty good.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.000
It's going to be hard.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.320
Talk about that in a minute.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.120
But but but good call out.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.340
Yeah.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:52.410
On so this often happens in promotion discussions.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.730
So I'll share I'll share with people.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.020
Brent Brent, thanks.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.420
People listen to the podcast.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.580
Anyway, keep talking.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.620
I'll share with Alan.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.020
Yeah.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:09.420
Because I don't think like over the years you've heard most of my management

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.180
philosophies, but I don't think you've heard this one, but we'll find out shortly.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:23.490
So, you know how at Microsoft we have ladder levels, but we also have these

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.690
things called bands, right?

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.770
And a band is sort of an aggregation of levels.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.410
Yeah.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:31.050
Right.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.490
So it's someone.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.730
One band, one level, one title may contain multiple levels.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.040
Right.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:46.490
So as an example, we have a band that's simply known as the one band and that

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.210
will have people in 59 or 60.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:56.930
And then the two band has 60 levels, 61 and 62, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.370
Yep.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.040
And just a little bit of context.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.720
So the reason was Microsoft had original ladder levels, which were like nine,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.680
10, 11, should could be, could be four or five, six or one, two, three at another

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.360
company when they changed them.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.840
They wanted to make the numbers so vastly different.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.840
People would not confuse one set with another.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.200
So that's why you're an inter-level software engineer at Microsoft.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.680
There's a level 59 general.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.040
Yes.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.970
Um, and there are, there are ladder levels lower than 59, but they're

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.770
generally not in development roles.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.170
Yeah.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.730
I was hired at what would be the equivalent of a level 57.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.230
Oh, I was hired at as a 10.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.510
I don't, I don't remember the mapping.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.390
Well, La-Dee-Dah.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.870
Guess who, guess who got more levels?

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.710
This guy.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.340
Uh, as far as I recall, we're now tied.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.740
No, cause I started lower.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.930
I got, I got more than you cause I started lower and got there.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.780
You started at 57 and what do we think a 10 is?

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.140
I'm just thinking through how many levels do I have to do?

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.780
And then I'm willing to do that.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.380
So a 10 was a 61.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:11.800
Was it?

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.240
Okay.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.800
Oh, yeah.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.680
You suck.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.800
No, I'm going to, I'm going to go a 10 is a 59.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.040
All right.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.400
There you go.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.640
The next two.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.200
You're good.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:23.840
You're good.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.680
Story time continues.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.240
Okay.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:34.240
So for, for me as a manager, my ICs are generally going to be, my individual

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.840
contributors are going to be in one of four bands and those are the one, two,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.600
then senior, then principal.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.080
Okay.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.440
And I have a little speech.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.280
Okay.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.480
Around exit and entrance criteria.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.320
Cause when we go on a cross band, things happen.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:50.880
Okay.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.040
The level one band, basically to get into it, you have to pass the interview.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.000
That's, it's, it's, that's it.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:07.550
Um, but to get out of it, you have to show, um, that you have mastered the ability.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:08.750
You have to show two things.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.190
Number one, that you have mastered the ability to independently learn.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.680
And number two, that you have a, that you have the capability to independently

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.600
execute, okay.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.120
So far, so good.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:29.570
Now, similarly with the, the two band, the two bands role is to construct autonomy.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:34.370
To get out of it, you have to show that you have mastered independent execution,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.590
but you have to show the capability of leadership.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:46.170
And then similarly, um, senior band, you have to master leadership, but show

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.530
the capability of ownership.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:53.850
And when I talk about ownership here, I mean, um, you're going to own

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.010
a small part of the business.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:03.000
Uh, and the principal band, you are expected to get a task from an executive.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:10.100
Hey, Brent, I need you to go move this KPI or go solve this problem.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:16.660
It's, it's like maximum ambiguity and it's your job to own that part of the business.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.860
And sometimes it involves sucky things.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.340
So if you haven't mastered leadership, it's going to be really hard.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:31.400
Now, um, on leadership, people will often ask me, okay, what do you mean leadership?

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:37.960
Like, like, because there's so many people that view leadership and manager.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.200
Ascentonyms.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.560
And I say, no, no, there is, they are absolutely not synonyms.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.240
And I, I tell them this and I'll do this.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:57.960
Um, no, cause you'll give me a crappy, you'll give me an answer that doesn't go

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.920
the way I want and I'll say, okay, let me share with you how I know if someone's

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.520
a leader, okay.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.120
And it's very simply this, they have followers.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.040
Yeah.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:10.640
Okay.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.920
This is not a circular definition.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.120
I would have given you that answer.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.600
That's all right.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:14.840
I know.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.280
It's not a circular definition as a lot of people will do.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.160
No, that's a key thing.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.160
They have followers.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.160
Now, the hard thing is what is a follower?

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.630
Are you asking me?

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:29.030
Yeah.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.950
I can get after it.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.790
It's a topology.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.080
What do you want the answer to be?

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.330
Cause I want to, I w I have a followup on this, but I don't want to, I don't

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.770
want to play along.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.610
What's a follower.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.050
If I say a leader has followers, what is a follower?

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.770
Someone who has someone who has a leader.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:47.900
Okay.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.820
So yeah, that that's the, the tautological, stupid, circular answer.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.140
You can do better than this.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.580
I know the executive lobotomy hasn't fully stuck.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.140
Oh, I am.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.060
I am practically brain dead.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.080
Um, okay.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.080
What is the difference between a direct report and a follower?

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.710
A follower follows you because they want to.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.790
Okay.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:15.470
Why?

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.440
Because now you're, you're massively overlapping with the levels of

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.480
leadership I want to talk to because they want to, because of, because

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.720
they believe in what you're doing for the organization.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.600
They believe that you can achieve results with them.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:36.320
Or whether they believe that your path is beneficial, right?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.760
Whether it's intrinsically or extrinsically, it doesn't frigging matter.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.600
But they believe that that's the path for that.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.360
Okay.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.830
Um, so it is a lot easier to be a manager than a leader, but, uh, I

00:22:54.950 --> 00:23:00.830
won't move someone into a manager role unless they are also a leader and

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:09.650
have shown the ability to, to acquire followers versus what is often the

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.850
case, like we've seen bullies.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.610
No, I, a person that does what you want them to do out of

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.090
fear is not a follower.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.010
Oh, no, no, not at all.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:19.930
Not at all.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.560
It's in there.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.240
It's in there.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.120
Actually, I don't even want to say it's in their better interest

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.600
to follow because if you're a bully, right, you're threatening them.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.320
Right.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:38.520
The, but in getting that idea into a future leader's head around what is

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:45.170
a follower and what it means, and it's about influence, not, um, not

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:51.810
an organizational change, um, can be difficult, but the more I stick

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.250
with it and stay consistent.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:24:01.640
I have had a number of people, um, be successful, um, making that shift

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:09.120
and that shift sustains them through the rest of the levels.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.080
Cause it starts sitting in their mindset.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.560
Like it's just as hard getting people to understand ownership because like,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.760
I don't know when you went into the principal band, I don't know if

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.040
you hit the same sort of system shock I did.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.610
It's, it's, it's not a linear progression.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.940
Like, like up until around senior, there's sort of this obvious thing, but

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:41.600
no, getting over into, into principle is we trust that we can leave you alone

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.920
and that you'll do high ROI things for the business.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:45.560
Yeah.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.040
And that's your, for me, that was, I spent many years doing that.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.280
He's having to do that next box.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.440
It's before on windows CE, that on stupid link project, but that was my thing.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.600
I just liked to figure out people trusted me to figure out what the right

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.840
thing to do was and get it done.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.760
Yep.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.160
And yeah, but absolutely right.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.800
And then I've seen people at principal struggle.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.240
I want to go back to levels of leadership, but the quick thing on principle

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.320
is, um, I heard someone say once I keep up the principle.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.360
I keep telling people what to do, but they don't do it.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:24.530
And if it, well, um, I'll give you one guess where the problem is and it's not then.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:25.490
Yeah.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.750
So I, you're, I know we've talked about it before on the podcast.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.110
I want to go a little more deeply than we have, because it aligns

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.710
really well with what you just said.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.430
And John Maxwell wrote this book called the five, I think it's called

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.430
the five levels of leadership.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.630
Please don't type and look it up.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.480
Type, type, type, type, type.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.200
So the first thing he talks about is putting people, your first level of

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.640
leadership is that you are in a position of leadership.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.440
People follow you because they have to.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.040
Yeah.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.720
No, that's okay.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.120
Fine.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.600
Again, you don't look, I get it.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.360
I get it.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:00.720
I get it.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.800
He calls that the five levels of leadership and that's fine.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:11.360
Holy, but listen, think of you and I both can name people managing today.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:16.050
That are managing their team and demanding their respect because they're

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:20.130
in that position of leadership and haven't done Jack squat other than that.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.450
That's true.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.210
A single higher level.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:23.610
But that's true.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:28.810
But I hope that the way this progresses level two and five have nothing to do

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:29.810
with having been a manager.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.650
Can I kind of finish before you get in here with all the bullshit?

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.740
So you're in a position of leadership.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.540
I'm never going to make it.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.780
People follow because they have to.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.140
These leaders who stay in this position either aren't leaders anymore or they

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.020
focus on rules, control and compliance.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.380
Maybe a manager at McDonald's can get away with this for a longer time.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.860
Nothing against McDonald's except for that one where Trump was.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:02.540
Then people give you permission at level two, people give you permission to lead them.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.780
These leaders are beginning to build those relationships with their teams.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.100
They're fostering trust.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.620
They're building a foundation.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.860
This is where we want people to start rather than level one.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.660
We want to start.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.000
And again, no matter what, Brent, I'm promoting you to a lead.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:25.480
Briefly, it may be a day, but briefly when I started a new company, I am in a position of

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:25.800
leadership.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.720
I am at level one as quickly as possible.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.440
I have to get to level two because level one sucks for everyone.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:34.650
It exists.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.940
I'm in a position like here's the new guy in charge.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:38.740
Okay.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.540
I don't know him.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.220
Why would I give him permission to follow me?

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.100
After permission, it's production.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.020
People follow you because of what you've done for the organization.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.920
So again, at this level of leadership, you're focusing, you have the relationships built.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.120
You're focusing on like you get the team aligned around achieving organizational goals.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.360
So they follow you.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.560
You deliver results together.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.780
At people four, people follow you.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.060
Level three is probably different.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:14.060
The organization at level four, people follow you because what you have done for them.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.400
So these people are they follow you.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.680
This is we're getting into probably if you want to call these managers, they're probably

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.440
managers and managers, but they don't have to be.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.160
Their focus is on developing people.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.520
And I talk a lot in my blog at angerweasel.substack.com plug.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840
I need a little jingle for that.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.360
I'll write one sometime.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.080
People at this level are sorry, I lost my train of thought when I gave the plug.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.160
I manage the people, not the work.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.800
And we know so many managers are focused on managing the work.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.080
Give people a framework they can work in and then let them succeed.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:58.880
So at this level four, it's all about creating that culture of self-sufficiency,

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.880
autonomy, giving people going.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.400
And then finally, not all leaders get here.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.600
And Maxwell calls this out.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.400
This is where we want to get to at level five.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.560
Not only are people following you because of who you are and what you represent, but the

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.720
key thing leaders at level five do is they develop more leaders.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:26.550
Their focus purely on not purely, primarily on culture and values and making sure that

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.030
the people that are reporting to them or the organization themselves are becoming better

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.270
leaders because of all kinds of other stuff going on.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:34.910
Very complex.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.390
Not very many leaders get here.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.670
I don't know very many leaders that are there, but it's where we should all strive to be.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:46.750
It's, you get how these advance and how they get more difficult as you go up.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.430
But it's a nice little, it's probably too long to go.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:54.790
I mean, the book's like a gazillion pages and I just kind of summarized it in five

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:55.830
minutes and badly.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:56.790
So I don't know.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.190
To me, it's really stuck because especially those first couple of levels, you have to

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:06.150
move from a position of leadership and I've worked for people talking to you, Peter.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.150
Oh, God damn it.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.950
Alex has Alex.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.390
Alan has frozen.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.550
I don't know if he can hear me.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.220
I will sit here and hopefully remember.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.730
I was taking a screenshot of his face though.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:24.570
That's funny.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:27.970
Do you hear me?

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.010
I do.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.100
You know, this was not a Riverside thing.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.660
I'm not sure where you lost me.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.460
I have to kind of, I was on a roll.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.460
I'm never going to get it back.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.340
Um, my wonderful Xfinity internet just puked and it's weird.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.700
It almost always pukes during this hour on a Friday and it's fairly consistent the

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.220
rest of the time.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.180
I don't know what's going on.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:56.060
My wifi stayed up hot five bars the whole time, although now it tells me it's off.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.980
So I don't know what's going on.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.460
Do you hear me?

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:57.780
All right.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.500
I do.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.820
This is weird.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:00.900
Okay.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.100
That was just my Mac getting caught up.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.700
So I don't know what's going on, but we're back.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.940
And I was talking about five levels of leadership.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.020
And then what was I talking about before Comcast cut me off?

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:10.660
I don't know.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.100
You are on a pretty good roll though.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:12.980
All right.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.820
Well, we're never going to know where that goes because I have the

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.580
attention span of piss.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.340
Um, I wrote down notes though.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.820
Oh, why don't you refresh me and we'll just go from here.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.780
You know, listeners, you get what you pay for.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.380
Here we go.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.460
Tell me your problem.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:30.900
Stinky.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:31.780
Yeah.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.930
I have, I like the order.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:40.010
Um, yeah, my only problem is that he calls it the first level of leadership.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:41.570
It should be the zero.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:42.770
I know.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:48.720
I know he's not a, he's not a software guy Maxwell.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.280
So tech people count in zeros.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:51.960
I don't know.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.800
Was that loud?

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.000
That in my house or yours?

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.000
That was in your house.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.320
Okay.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.680
Hold on.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.480
All right.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.360
Let's see where the cat went.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.240
No cats right there.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:00.600
All right.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.320
What wasn't the cat?

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.370
It's probably the daughter.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:09.170
Ah, no, hold on, man.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.570
I'm going to, I'm going to keep things you done.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:10.890
You good.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.410
You good.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:11.890
Oh, well, no.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.890
So I wrote down, okay.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.170
I did it in an, in alliteration.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.010
So level zero is people.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.050
Level one is permission.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.410
Level two is production.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:32.640
Level three is personal and level four is propagation.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:33.840
It's funny.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.280
I believe Maxwell calls them, he also gives them peace.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.480
But I think he uses, if I remember right, I'll look it up in the book.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.400
Someone asked Chad GPT, position, permission, production, people and pinnacle.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:50.890
Sure.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:52.370
Sure.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:33:04.500
I think I've told you before that I went pretty far in my younger years and take

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.200
one though, and that's right.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.320
And now it's weird because I still, I marvel over the fact that chronologically

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.260
I am older than you, but I'm just younger.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:18.980
Anyway, go on.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.830
Maybe I'm Benjamin Button.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.630
And the horse you rode it on is what I'm currently thinking.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.470
All right.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:36.260
The, but, uh, so it's different in, in different styles.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:41.860
Uh, but the style of take one though, I went through, right.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:47.100
So you, you know, that the ultimate in is a black belt and you can get

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:52.980
multiple degrees in black belt, but, uh, the color belts, what you are in, when you,

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.140
when you, um, up to getting to black.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:04.930
And in my particular style, uh, the color belts were intended to represent sort of

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:14.520
the growth of a plant from, from a white seed all the way up to sort of the red

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:20.080
belt, which is the last color belt before black and red represents the

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:26.210
beginning of death and black indicates is dead, is dead.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:33.490
But, um, the reason for that symbolism though, is not directly dead because

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:37.370
when a plant dies, it spreads its seeds.

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:44.880
So most, um, most martial arts that I'm familiar with, right.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.080
They will actually tell you, no, actually the color belt, like the destination isn't

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:55.620
black, the color belts are, we're pounding into you all the pre-reqs

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.220
necessary for you to be actually begin your martial arts training.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:05.620
Martial arts training really is intended to begin at the, uh, once you get your

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:16.430
black belt, um, anyway, it's a neat story that somehow, somewhat related to your

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.950
leadership story, like on the propagation thing.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:24.030
Well, this was all the answer to how's it going, Brent?

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.950
It was.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:29.350
And there's actually one other thing that I, that like our little, our

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:35.310
little brief unexpected intermission share, or made me remember.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:43.640
Um, I have officially decided to take exactly the same journey you did about

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.830
four, five, six, 18 years ago.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.210
And that is, um,

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:51.650
I was just out of high school

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:57.720
on November, at the end of next week, no later than the end of the next week.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.400
I will be waving bye-bye to Xfinity.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.430
Oh, you mean to cable TV?

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:08.430
No.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.080
Xfinity.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.680
All right.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:17.720
I kind of get my Xfinity highly subsidized, so I'm sticking with it.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.430
I am shifting over to Zipli.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.110
Nice.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.830
Nice.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.470
So, um, yeah, I just get Xfinity super cheap.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:33.410
So, uh, I, I, and the fact that it goes out during the podcast, you know,

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.890
maybe it's great.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.810
You get what you pay for.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:36.610
Yeah.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:42.770
I realized like in the last year, um, so I have like the,

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:47.690
the super duper package and I'm like, okay, really?

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.330
In the last year I shifted over.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.890
I'm not watching broadcast TV.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:56.130
I'm all, no, the only things I watch are on, on the streaming channel.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.530
Nobody watches broadcast TV.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.690
It's a dying business.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:36:59.290
Yeah.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.490
I say working for a company that delivers broadcast TV, but they'll

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.410
figure it out eventually.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.440
Oh no.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.080
Well, I think, I think that move has already happened, right?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.280
Yeah.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:10.440
Yeah.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.410
Netflix, their lowest offering is with ads, right?

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.650
Yep.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.370
And we were like, okay.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:22.860
Now they just need a live stream nightly news show per market.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.240
Yeah.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.200
I wonder how far I had to do a thing.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.200
We should start that.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.200
I do not want to go into this deeply.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:40.780
I do not want to, but I have to mention, I had to do a little, um, uh,

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.020
what would I call it?

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.050
Uh, little survey for a thing I'm going to in a few weeks.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:52.410
And I had to, the question was something around, write out a fictional news

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.530
headline that captures how the world has changed by 2030, something like that.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.290
Or I said it's 2030, write a fictional news line about how the world has changed.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.890
And I will tell you what I wrote cause there's nothing in here, but going

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:09.680
into why broadcast may be dying again, I don't know how right I am, but I'm just

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.310
going to read this to you is the headline I wrote was AI driven newsroom set new

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:20.190
standard major media outlets operate with 80% fewer human reporters focusing

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.430
on real time, hyper personalized content streams.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:28.670
So what you do is you log into Netflix, you click news and you get your

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:33.590
personal content stream based on a bunch of stuff has been curated for you.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:38.650
So news is sort of delegated to the masses and it comes to you based on your

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.370
preferences, kind of just like tick tock.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:44.170
But, uh, anyway, that was my, that was my idea for the future.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:44.890
Just a mess.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.210
I don't think we're too far away from that.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:48.570
Maybe 2030 is too long.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:50.210
Yeah.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.130
I mean, I could think about how to implement that.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:58.350
And I debated leaving people get so freaked out about AI taking jobs.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:02.470
I debated leaving off that part, but I also wanted to put it in there.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.390
But anyway, a little thing now we've talked about AI in the podcast.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.270
We got that part done.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.550
Uh, I did, um, uh, a trap ton of travel.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.550
I went to New York for two weeks, hang out with my daughter, stopped in

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:17.630
Bozeman on the way home to take care of my nephews for a week, got back home.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:18.950
I'm here for two weeks.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.910
I'm going back to New York a week after that.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.670
And, uh, man, just too much going on.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.910
I'm looking forward to the slow.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.550
Well, holiday's coming up.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:37.180
Is that going to be slow for you or, um, it depends if I survive the election.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.190
Okay.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.430
So I have a question for you on that one.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.830
Yes.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:46.630
Like, like the, cause that could be a double entendre.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:47.230
Right.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:52.150
Cause given your business, it's really more of the first one, given that this

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:59.940
is like, you know, at unity, we had code freezes for, uh, like, uh, Christmas,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.500
uh, dads and grads days that would have huge spikes would be very, we would

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:09.300
never freeze, but we'd be careful around deployments and changes, uh, in the day

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.140
who would have spikes and add traffic.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:16.420
Microsoft had not really code freezes, but dads and grads and holidays and

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:21.420
things were, were sale just to make sure stuff was up, uh, news like Olympics

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.300
is big elections, huge, and the election cycle may take a lot longer here.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.620
And a matter of just keeping, keeping news stations, all local news stations

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:35.880
all over the country, national news stations up, uh, getting, uh, web-based

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.560
news also up quickly and updated and all that stuff.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.000
It's, um, it's going to be a little zippity doodah here for a while.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.440
And in some, some years, you know, in a, in a normal year, you know, like

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.720
when we were kids, the election cycle may take three or four days or out

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.280
around elections, a bunch of news comes in, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.720
no matter what happens in this election, no matter what happens, the news is

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.860
going to go batshit for two weeks, minimum, minimum.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.470
Now, like we should be taking bets.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:16.800
Like how long before we actually know who's president?

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.140
Oh, see there.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:33.400
We're going to know on November 6th, we're going to know whether getting the rest of

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.840
the country, I mean, getting people that don't have critical thinking to know

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.280
will take the remaining two weeks.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.020
A lot.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.300
We didn't know on the day of the election last time.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.180
We knew the next day.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:50.600
We did know the next day, late in the next day, but the next day.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:52.780
Yeah.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.810
Well, we're going to see what happens.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:01.850
But anyway, yeah, we better, we are running out of time here in the

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.370
palatial studios of A.B.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:03.850
testing.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.730
I have one interesting thing.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:13.070
I wasn't going to say anything, but we had a little bit of a of a audio

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:19.560
issue at the beginning and I had to do the thing right, unplug and plug back

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.200
in the USB connector to my audio device.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.000
And that worked great.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.990
But then when it did that, I didn't notice that it changed my

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.310
microphone input to my laptop, which is fine.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:30.110
That works out pretty well.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.510
It's a little more tinny, but I can fix it in EQ and post.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:38.590
But then just to make things more fun, after my computer, after the

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.870
after Xfinity, crap the bed and I had to reconnect.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.910
When I reconnected, it connected back to my good microphone.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.110
So now our listeners get two different microphones, which I get the blend

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.110
and post production and see what happens.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:50.830
So, you know what?

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.630
Either it sounds awful.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:43:00.330
And again, I hope you enjoyed your time with this anyway, or it sounds great

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:04.090
and you marvel over my audio awesomeness.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.960
Or no, no more ors or it doesn't.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.400
It's a dichotomy.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.320
It doesn't have to look what would sound great mean it to me.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.800
It's either it sounds awful or it doesn't.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.220
Well, I'm an unfortunate audio file, so I will know.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.900
But if the rest of people, yeah, whatever.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.660
Do you think?

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.900
All right, man, I am kind of know who I am.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.620
I'm not Brent's cat, so I must be Alan.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:36.060
And I also am not Brent's cat, so I must be Alan.
