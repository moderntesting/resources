WEBVTT

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.230
Good morning everybody.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.230
Howdy.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.230
Hey, I'm Alan.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.230
I'm Brent.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.430
And we're here for episode 41 of AB testing.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.430
Woo hoo!

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.670
AB stands for Alan and Brent.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.310
It's also the name of a popular experimentation method of comparing two versions or treatments

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.760
of a product, website, etc.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.890
Yes, and it occurs to me for the first time since we had this new drinking game, here's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.010
something I think we haven't talked about previously.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.730
We haven't talked about the fact that I just got back from not just but last week, I gave

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.090
my talk on experimentation and AB testing at Better Software.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.610
I feel like it went pretty well.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.170
I promoted the podcast.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.530
Hopefully we have a new member of the three.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.530
Hopefully.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.530
Yeah.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.770
Wasn't this one the workshop model?

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.770
Yeah, it was.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.930
So tell me how it goes.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.660
I'm interested.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.260
We talked about what it was, who was doing it, nobody, what they knew about it, nothing.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.700
We played one of the games that I graciously was able to borrow from Ronnie Guevara, who's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.030
done a lot of experimentation at Microsoft on how your intuition on which treatment is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.150
better is probably wrong.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.620
And then we emphasized a lot that data trumps intuition, so how to get that data, things

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.180
to do, ways to do experiments.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.740
We talked a little bit about statistical significance and the math that goes into it.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.140
We talked about designing experiments.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.220
I even went and used Google Analytics to set up an AB experiment on angryweasel.com of

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.380
just two different web pages and show how, if you want to do very low scale AB testing,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.220
it's how simple it is to set up.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.940
And then we also talked about the architecture on how you would do sort of a flighting system

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.580
to do, not sort of, a flighting system or something to do experimentation on a much

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.580
larger scale.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.860
Examples, we tried some things out.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.180
We had a lot of discussion back and forth.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.460
And believe it or not, there was enough details and nuance and all that.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.260
We talked a lot about the caveats of how to look at the data coming in and different

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.860
things you can get from this, et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.860
That was kind of it.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.600
That's one of my favorite discussions, the caveats.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.400
Like Wikipedia has this fantastic link.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.710
If you look up cognitive biases, it's like seven pages of individual biases.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:44.030
And I go back and I look at that frequently and judge which of these am I committing today?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.030
Have you seen whichtestone.com?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.110
Treatment A, treatment B, guess which one's better, and nobody can get more than two in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.870
a row right ever.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.420
Whichtestone has pretty much one of those every day for around the industry.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.420
Whichtestone.com?

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.340
Whichtestone.com.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.340
Very cool.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.340
I'll be looking at that.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.340
Yeah, it's a pretty cool site.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.620
I get to my feed list and maybe it's not once a day, but it's multiple times a week.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.620
Super interesting.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.940
What I find is more fascinating or more not fascinating, where I get my most learning

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.700
from that, I go, huh, I wouldn't have guessed that.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.740
But the comment section below has people that don't know what they're doing.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.100
A lot of people who actually do know what they're doing who kind of helped me get some

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.060
insights I wouldn't have been able to get without them.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.060
So it's kind of fun.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.820
Something I find fascinating with, particularly Ronnie's explanation of the game.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.820
Last time I saw it was a couple years ago.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.660
And he does a really good job for the ones that he's able to address explaining why so

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.140
that you can learn where your intuition went into the weeds.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.140
But that's very difficult.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.580
One of the things I brought up is that experimentation and the framework behind, the framework you

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.340
use behind it will tell you which test won, but it doesn't really tell you why.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.700
You can use data to get a good idea of what's why, but you don't know why.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.700
Not initially, no.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.180
You'll have to do a lot of extra digging.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.980
But Ronnie has been using that deck for a long time.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.420
Yeah, and he's modified it a lot.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.940
He's some other experimenters.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.500
I like the which test won because now I can get some non-Microsoft experiments.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.420
They're more relevant, or at least more recent.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.820
The final thing I got into, and I didn't mention in my previous shortened synopsis, is the idea

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.100
of building an experimentation culture where everything's an experiment.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.820
It's a journey to get there, but when you get a team that has this idea of everything's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.020
an experiment, it's a pretty fascinating place, a pretty fun place to be as far as software

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.580
development goes.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:55.070
Yes, it aligns with Patrick's, Tess Pappy's presentation, where he was talking about ignorance

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.070
and knowledge.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.070
Yeah.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:04.630
And when you are able to create a culture of experimentation where you essentially only

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.640
value knowledge that is validated.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.740
Yeah.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.740
It is pretty cool.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.740
It is cool.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.740
It's really fun.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.100
I always like talking about, with you, when I actually do stuff in the data side of the

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.020
world, just to show you I can dip my foot over there.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.180
Y'all know that's ...

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.340
I try and prove to you that I really am a generalist.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.340
Specializing generalist.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.140
I have my specialties, but I don't mind dipping in deep in areas that I find.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.500
Not only that I find interesting, but I think are critical to making good software.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:46.410
So now you have successfully impressed me enough on this front.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:55.070
Now what I'd like to see you get to, it is review time, so here's your next priority.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.140
And that's use it.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.700
All right.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.260
Thanks, Brent.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.580
And we can start with once a quarter.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.220
There's a lot more.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.820
We could go a lot deeper there, but I don't want to go too far off the books.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.060
Hey, you mentioned I'm going to go back to ... Actually, I'll do a brief announcement,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.700
and then we'll actually talk about the fact that it is review season.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.400
I looked up my calendar, and just like, sometime in the last year, I put a date on my calendar,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.100
so I would remember to mention it on the AB testing show, and maybe in a tweet.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:31.640
But tomorrow, June 18th, which may be yesterday by the time you hear this, is the 12-year

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.420
anniversary of my very first blog post.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.420
Congratulations.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.780
I don't know if it's an anniversary we're celebrating, just more of a milestone, but

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.020
it was on the old MSDN blog site.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.020
Actually it still exists.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.620
What was the title?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.620
The title of my ...

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.740
Hi, I'm Alan.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.740
You know what?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.740
I don't know.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.500
I think the title was I'm Not a Blogger.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.700
That was the title of one of my very first few blog posts.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:07.330
The context was I was about to present at a embedded developers conference on how to use

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.890
the tools that we had written, the test framework we had written in Windows CE, so that ISVs

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:19.210
or IHVs, independent hardware vendors, could write tests for their drivers and their firmware

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.730
for Windows CE devices.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.850
So, Wnts was still alive 12 years ago?

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.530
It feels like much longer than it was killed.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.290
It was around for a while.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.490
I ended up doing a bunch of those over a couple years.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.490
So I wanted a place to be able to answer post conference questions and to post slides and

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.110
samples, et cetera.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.450
So I started it for that and then eventually I said, I'm going to use this to actually

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.250
practice writing, learn how to write and be careful because then you end up writing books

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.890
and shit and life goes crazy.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.210
But anyway, 12 years since my very first blog post, which was weird because it was

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.480
almost ... It was like a week after my nine year anniversary at Microsoft.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.460
June, a time of many milestones.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:15.310
I started blogging for exactly the same reason, improved writing, improved communication.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.870
I would say having gone back recently and looked through some of my old stuff, I would

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.190
say I've achieved that but my pace is slow.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:30.750
If you go to ... If you want a real treat, you can go to blogs.msdn.com, Wack Alum

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:37.840
P-A and the A-L-A-N-P-A. I think the actual URL has changed as they've gone through different

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.960
formats but my old posts are still there and it's like a child wrote them.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960
Yeah.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960
All right.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.440
And the other thing, first off, it feels like it's been 12 years since I've written

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.960
my last blog.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:00.620
I've been working on one off and on for the last month.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.820
It's hard to do all this writing and go to school and do work.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.820
And stay employed.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.780
And still know what my children look like.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.820
Hey, speaking of staying employed, what do we call it now?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.660
It's sort of reward, performance, feedback.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:25.180
We separated at Microsoft the individual discussion on how you're doing with the rewards, although

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.980
they're still kind of tied just unofficially.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.700
But it's time for rewards and I want to talk a little bit about how ...

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.780
I don't even know if it's unofficial.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.260
Really what the thing is is that we're not allowed to talk ... Essentially, we're not

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:45.580
supposed to or allowed to talk about performance during the reward discussion.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.580
Blah, blah, blah.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.580
Exactly.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:54.340
So, I'm on my fourth or so different way we review people at Microsoft and I want to

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.220
talk a little bit about it and the games people play and the tools I use to get around

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.220
that.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.220
It's always an interesting time.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.860
I'm a manager now of just a few people, but even when I wasn't a manager, I was always

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:12.180
invited to be part of these review discussions because generally my role is someone that works

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.180
across the org.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.460
I have a good insight, I have a sort of an objective insight across the org on how

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.540
I know more people.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:28.340
Given the job I do, I tend to know what more people do in the org than any of my peers.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.900
We had our discussion last week and like every other discussion we've had about people and

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:41.470
any team at Microsoft over the last 10 or 12 years I've been doing this was ... It was

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.830
interesting and people played games.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.870
For the most part, the right things happened.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.150
But I want to talk about some of the games they play.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.430
What games have you seen people play during these discussions?

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.100
Oh, I see all sorts of games.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.030
You tell me one or I'll tell you one.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:10.950
I will tell you the game I use most often and that is ... First and foremost, before

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.910
I go into that, you ever study the prisoner's dilemma?

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.510
Yeah.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:25.460
It's the prisoner's dilemma that's being played out where there is really no

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.930
benefit to collaboration.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:38.700
I'll say the best review discussion I've ever had was the last time I was a middle

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:46.260
manager and I was able to successfully convince my leads that for the review

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:54.620
discussion they are not to defend their people.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:12:01.300
What they are to do is to put themselves in my shoes and assume that their people

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:08.340
are part of our business team and we're going to focus on what needs to be done

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.490
going forward.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.210
And I'm simplifying here.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.130
You're sure and you're being very philosophical about it.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.050
But it worked very well.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:25.890
The people started ... I remember one lead was like, hey, that person really needs

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:30.410
consistency on this, this and this in order to really get to the next level.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.530
I have that work.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.170
How about we talk about me moving that work to your team and you have that guy

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:35.810
do it.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.010
It was very productive.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.010
Okay, so let me ... I'm going to take over because you're not getting where I

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:40.690
want you to get to.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.570
I'm about to go there.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.010
Let me ... it took too long.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:43.650
Okay.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.730
I'll tie this into something else I brought up in my workshop.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:53.930
I've read most of the Dan Ariale books on irrational ... why people do irrational

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.530
things.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.210
I forget the names.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.930
Irrational yours or something.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.850
Predictably irrational is the first book.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:59.010
Yes.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.210
So there's a story in one of those books, I believe.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:07.010
I didn't fact check, but I'm sure I read it there, where they did a study where

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.850
people went to a movie theater and they had two sizes of popcorn available,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.290
a small for $3 and a large for $7.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:20.050
Most people bought the $3 popcorn and when asked why, they all said the $7 seems

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.890
pretty expensive for popcorn.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.970
It's too much.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.410
Different movie theater or same movie theater, different night.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.810
They had three sizes of popcorn, a small for $3, a medium for $6.50 and a large

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.090
for $7.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:40.770
Most people bought the large and when asked why, they said because it's such

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.130
a good deal, it's only $0.50 more than the medium.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.680
Yep.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.520
Interesting the way the brain works.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:54.200
So let me tell you a game I saw and two ways I know to break this game, but I

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.280
want to kind of hear what you thought.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.480
So the game I saw played is very similar to that game where you take, as a

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.880
manager, you bring in the employee that you ... we have this rating scale that

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.160
goes from $100 is the middle and it goes down from there and up from there

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.360
from $0 to $200.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.640
That's sort of your scale where we put people on for rewards.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.040
Okay.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.970
There is a person from one manager who is above average but not way above

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.730
average.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.250
My ratings are usually right in line with where they come in.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.810
So that's where they're seeing my peers as well.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.130
In other words, you bully your peers into ...

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.730
No, no, no.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.290
I hardly say anything.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.710
But anyway, this person came in at $200.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.870
This guy is a rock star, walks on water.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.870
$200 is ...

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.950
Jesus looks up to him.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.950
Something like that.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:43.950
Got it.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.990
And I immediately recognized it as the game.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.270
Because what happens there is ... generally ...

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.270
It's the ... talk me ...

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.230
He's not a $200.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.350
You'll talk me down to the value I want.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.070
And I think he got talked down to a value above where perhaps he should

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.070
have been.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.070
And then everybody just happens.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.790
Like, okay, I feel better about this.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.230
Same game, interesting way.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.390
I have two ways.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.830
One very good way I've done this in the past.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.510
But I'm curious what you've done.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.560
What do you do when you see someone playing that game?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:21.140
So the last time I really had to deal with that particular game, the best solution that

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.140
I've had for that is ... you know what?

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.570
We're going to reschedule this meeting.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:33.340
Each manager needs to come in balanced.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.340
It's not a great one.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.340
No.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.860
It's a horrible thing because I do not believe that every team has to be balanced.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.420
I think there can be better teams than other teams.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.980
Oh, and I completely agree.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:51.540
But what we do ... so once they come in balanced, then we have a discussion around who moves

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.540
up.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:58.540
So this exercise works exactly the same or very similar to the previous bucket systems

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.580
I've had at Microsoft, no matter which bucket system it was.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.060
You want to put, as far as rewards go, like who are they like.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.420
So two ways I've fought this in the past.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:13.760
I'll give you the actual one that works 100% of the time in this case.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.790
One way to stop this game is that anywhere where there's a discussion or a discrepancy,

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.350
anywhere, whether it's by 20% or 60%, if there's a discussion in the room for even

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.770
a minute on ... I don't think that's right for that person.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:33.000
That person drops to zero, not permanently, but they get dropped to zero and they're

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.720
left there until the rest of the discussion's done.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.300
So what happens is ... this is another game too, but played a different way.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:44.960
What happens is managers come into that room, putting people into the spot, into their

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.960
bucket where they don't expect to have any controversy.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.560
Where there's controversy, those things go to zero, and then at the end of the

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:59.040
discussion where you decided where everybody else go, then you can play the is like a game

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.120
and put them in the right spot where they belong, not where they were put in.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.880
So if you put someone in an obviously bad place, you force a hard discussion around

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.960
that person at the end of the conversation, everybody else has been agreed on.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.200
That one works very, very well.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.040
I have never heard that one.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.040
That's really good.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.720
You got to play it for managers, play that game.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720
That's an anti-game.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.170
And you can even argue it.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:28.330
You can say, hey, look, what we want to do is go quickly through the ones we agree on

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.690
and cue up all the discussion at the end.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.370
Let me tell you about another game people play.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.730
I'm going to talk about the fallacy.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.520
Peak in May.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:42.000
The peak in May game means, is because we do reward discussions in June, that what

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.120
you do in July, August, September, pretty much all the way to March or April, doesn't

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.240
matter as much as what you do in May.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.560
Yes.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.680
Oh, peak in May.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.840
Peak in May.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.320
I was thinking peak is in like, no, peak in on someone.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.230
So how do you fight the peak in May game?

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.140
I take that one head on.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.260
I go, OK, great.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.770
He did a great job in May.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.010
So remind us all what he did in the prior quarters.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.330
I always ask, what were the results in the first half of the year?

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.050
That discussion comes up a lot.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.970
When there's discussion around people, in time

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.530
there's like controversy, what did they do in the first half of the year?

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.050
Well, they had a really rough first half and blah, blah, blah.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.850
I said, then they're not.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:29.370
That's fine.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.850
They had a great second half, but they're not 180 or whatever.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.850
You have to take the whole year into account.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.570
And that's more of a management issue.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:41.650
And I tend to, I'm not like, I have the smallest team in our org.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.690
But I've sat in, I probably sat in on more review discussions because I used

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.770
to sit in on other teams review discussions.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.290
I probably sat in on more of those than any person in our org.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.010
So I can tend to say the right things to make the right things happen.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:19:00.140
The other thing I think that is wise in terms of how you are presenting that question.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.660
You said, what were the results?

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:09.670
Because I have seen over and over again, and it's part of the discussions generally

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.270
do around Agile.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:17.330
Humans are built for relative, not concrete results.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:23.250
So you could actually really get yourself a rock star review by tanking,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:32.090
purposefully tanking the first half of the year so that, and then take your manager's

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:38.130
feedback to heart and rocket it up back to say normal.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:43.090
And the manager is going to basically say, number one, wow, I really helped this guy

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.410
improve.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:49.130
And look at the differential, even though the raw results at the end of the day was

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.110
nothing special.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.190
Cool.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.110
One final challenge to bring up in there here is the Microsoft, I think probably

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:01.750
any company who has some Agile values in them, values collaboration and helping

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:06.150
others as being very important, especially at more senior levels.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.150
So say I work for you, Brent.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.150
Okay.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.870
And I'm going to come to you and I'm going to give you, again, peaking in May,

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.590
I'm going to give you a bunch of information about how I've helped other people on the

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.430
team in hopes that you see that as a way to boost me up.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:24.200
How do you know how much I've helped versus my peers?

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:30.790
Like say there's a group of 10 of us in my level band and you're trying to figure

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:35.550
out you have, results are more tangible and measurable, but what's intangible and

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:42.550
more difficult to measure is how well my influence or how much my influence has

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:48.630
helped the team get better, either through general leadership, coaching, diving

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.030
in and helping others, et cetera.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:55.510
How do you compare what I've done in that intangible area versus my peers?

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.430
How do you know if I help more than someone else or as much or less?

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:06.450
The only way to really do that is a sucky way.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.610
And that's peer feedback.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.850
Our peer feedback system at Microsoft currently sucks.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:16.010
Just to clarify that for the listeners.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:21.690
The system is, I'm going to send out a list of, I'm going to send out an invitation to

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.520
give feedback to all the people I know who will say good things about me.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:33.330
Oh, and yeah, because in addition, even if someone had something not good to say about

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.770
you, they're not motivated.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:44.880
The last two review cycles, my entire team has gotten 100% strongly agrees in all their

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.010
peer feedback.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.690
And I think people are like, well, I don't want to have a discussion with this guy's

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:55.400
manager, so I'll just do five, five, five, five, five.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.960
What was the question I was asking?

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.890
Oh, how to deal with this.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:06.760
The other general strategy that I see is it's the lifeboat game.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:14.510
So when you're talking about collaboration against your peers, it's more about sorting

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:20.350
it by who pissed off others the most, because that's clearly visible versus who's

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.550
not always.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.550
Not always.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:29.110
I think there are many ways, plenty of ways for me to sabotage your career for the benefit

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.870
of mine without you knowing.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.030
Oh, for sure.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.270
Oh, the game of throwing people under the bus.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.830
Oh, yeah.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.710
Let me tell you what I've done to combat this in the past and in the end on this team.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:47.160
But if I stick around, perhaps we will.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.680
We don't stack rank anymore at Microsoft.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.840
I should clarify this.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.400
Managers don't stack rank their teams as part of the review process.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:01.800
One thing, say I have, I'm the leader of a team and I have like 15 people or 20 people

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.040
or some manageable number of people in some level band.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.430
I have a good idea of their output, but all the intangibles, as much as I pay attention

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.710
to them day to day, I want to get an idea of how much they help each other.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:22.180
What I do is I have every single one of you stack rank that your peers and you.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.700
So I'll do 10 for an even number.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:30.460
I ask each of you to stack rank the 10 of you along with your peers.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.420
So I get an idea of where you think you fit in and I get an idea of where you think

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.920
others are contributing to the team.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.200
When I can, and this is a heuristic, I'm going to pull these things together and

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.720
look for surprises.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.200
If I see one person consistently at the top, I go, and I thought they were pretty good.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.320
I'm now, yeah, they are awesome.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.480
And the rest of the team thinks they're awesome.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.200
And that's actually very, very important to me.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.360
The same, and I'll say anything at the bottom.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.160
And then surprises are interesting.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.760
That tells you where someone's playing the game.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.960
Like if I think like Brent, I think you are the best person on my team.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.160
And then I do this little exercise where I have you and all your peers rank you one

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.920
through 10 and you end up at the bottom of everyone's list.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.200
I go, wait a minute.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.400
Brent's nice to me, but I think he's an asshole.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.040
And the opposite can happen too, because managers, again, through the same

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.720
irrational behavior, I can think I could have flipped the bit on you.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.200
I thought, you know what?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.720
I don't know that Brent's contributing.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.680
He gets work gets done, but he says he's helping others, but I don't believe him.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.920
And to get past that, it's anecdotal.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.920
It's subjective data.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.440
But when I see you show up at the top of everyone's list, it forces me to think,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.760
you know what? Maybe I was wrong.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.720
I got to I got to figure out what I'm doing wrong here.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.080
There's a ton of value in that exercise.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.680
And it tells you who's playing the game versus who is truly valuable.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.680
I don't know about playing the game, right?

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:08.660
It's essentially what you've essentially done is is kind of created a source of

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.150
of data to help battle intuition.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.590
It's a cheap way to handle the fact that our peer feedback system is pretty much

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.470
non-existent.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:24.710
I have used that technique and the surprise situation where where you think

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:30.110
I was your rock star, but the rest of the group thinks I'm sucktastic.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:36.620
I have found seven times out of 10 that that is an indication of a hero in the

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:43.500
org because heroes generally damn the torpedoes.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.590
Yep.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.270
Nope. I'm here to get things done.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.390
The rest of you get out of my way or I'll stomp on you all on my way there.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.650
Yeah.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:58.250
So the thing I don't like is just to close on this a little bit is with a

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.450
lack of a peer feedback system, there's a little bit too much weight and

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:11.510
responsibility and error proneness of having the manager of a large team just

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:16.070
figure out without much data where everybody belongs, not just on output,

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:21.100
but output and collaboration and growth.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:31.980
The people discussion that I went through for my team was much simpler.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:45.490
We have a team of about 30 people and the goal was each manager went in with three

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.490
impact.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.170
So you said zero to 200, I believe.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.170
Yeah.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.100
You can think of us as having zero to two.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.100
Okay.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.100
Okay.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:02.940
And we were encouraged to discuss business results and just simply listen.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.220
So the decision is mine.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:14.660
But the listening part is my peers tell me what they observe with that individual

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.340
that I'm not observing.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.860
I don't have to change my score.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.380
I can keep it the way it is.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.860
But we go in with those three values and even our rewards were at those

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:33.710
at three distinct setting of the values and it will bubble up to my manager to

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:38.830
do the differentiation and then to his manager to do the differentiation.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.430
Too complicated.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.830
It's simpler than the system you've been going through.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.990
It really is.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.270
I just sit there and I talk about my guys.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:53.150
So it's better for me to work for someone who can speak better of me

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.460
regardless of the work I do.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.460
Yes.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.300
That's the lead I should gravitate towards.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.300
Absolutely.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.300
The one who likes me the most.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.300
Alright.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.330
Career tips from Brit.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.250
No but that's a true technique.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.250
It is.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.250
Right.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:17.180
The in these models right you have to be able to defend against if you're not the

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.740
most charismatic guy in the room you better have techniques to defend against

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.870
that guy.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.510
So here's one gaming system that I would love to see how you've dealt with.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.020
Yeah.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:39.580
People say it the adjective only manager which is doesn't communicate results just

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.860
communicates spews out a chain of adjectives.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.860
My guy is a rock star.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.500
The developer says this is the best dude ever.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.500
That sort of thing.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.180
I know you've had you've experienced that guy.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.420
I was reminded of our drinking game.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.780
We've talked about this before drinking game because for a while at our people

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.140
discussion the description of everyone started off with he's a great guy or

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.460
she's a great she's a great woman.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.460
Great.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.580
And it would HR rep stepped up to band that phrase from the discussion.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.310
Alright I think we have time for a little bit of answering of questions.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:26.730
So let me reach deep into the mailbag.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.650
Always good to have a mailbag.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.570
Steve Rowe.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.730
Thornken.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.730
Thornken.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.210
What is Thornken?

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:43.670
I actually asked him of course he did and he said that was his handle when he started way

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.270
back in the day on BBS's.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.270
That is hilarious.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:51.550
And when he told me that because I spent a lot of time on BBS's.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.550
Oh me too.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.190
And I'm like I'm wondering how many of the three don't even know what the hell that

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.670
is.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:03.390
But I was like is Steve old enough to have spent time on BBS's?

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.390
He looks young.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:11.350
There used to be a paper a free newspaper called computer user or something in the

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.350
Northwest.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.990
I used to pick it up and there were articles in there lots of ads for computers.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:22.270
But in the back was a whole list of phone numbers of all kinds of different BBS's.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.070
And I used to kind of go through there and try some out.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.510
Some were really lame and some had stuff.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.230
Then I found the friend of mine at Mittysoft.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:37.550
My company before I worked at Microsoft found me I forget the name of the BBS but in

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:42.470
this BBS I could actually get to a thing called the Internet.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:48.130
But this is this was I guess Mosaic was just coming around but I could go to Gofer and

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.130
search for things.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.170
And search was so slow.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.610
It was really bad.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:58.610
But a memory.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:03.290
So the reason I brought up Thornkin is Thornkin is Steve Rose's name on our Slack

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.290
channel.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:10.430
One of the three O N E O F T H R E E at slack.com.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.460
So anyway Steve asked a question.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.660
You might you might think that gee I thought this was the mailbag thing and

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.580
they're just randomly talking about BBS's.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.620
That's the way we roll.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:26.980
Steve asked about what the role of program management is in unified engineering.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:34.260
What functions do they serve and what what shifts to development.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:34.700
Right.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.100
It's part of that.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.940
What what work that is currently on a program manager's plate that moves to

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.980
dev tangent time.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.260
Yeah totally forgot this at the beginning.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.460
I'm very very sorry.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.980
But speaking of unified engineering.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.820
Yes I cheated on you.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.390
Again it happened.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.110
Sorry.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.790
No I'm fine.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.430
Yeah I I strayed.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.270
OK.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.230
But I had a good time and I do it again.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.000
As well you should.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.600
I was a guest on the testing show this week for their podcast unreleased at this

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:10.880
point.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.440
So I'll mention it again when it comes out.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.800
Talking about I wasn't sure what it was about at first because Matt Heuser

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.880
referred to as concurrent engineering but he meant like combined engineering

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.560
unified engineering you know the phrase works it's doing the activities are all

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.680
happening concurrently.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.720
And we talked about a little bit about that.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.530
So unified engineering reminded me that I forgot to mention it earlier.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:37.650
So shout out Michael Larson Justin Norman perzy is on the testing show.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.970
And Matt Heuser we had a good little talk about as good a talk as you can

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.130
have at an even earlier hour than this.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.680
Yeah if they record at eight their time that's five you know I did a 5 a.m.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.280
Talk.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.360
So answering Steve's question as if you thought we'd never get there.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.730
Brent on a unified engineering team.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.330
What the hell do program managers do.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:16.790
The role of a of a PM should be essentially get more customers identify the

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:25.370
features the requirements the opportunities that will acquire more happy customers for the

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.450
feature set of that team.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.050
That's it in a nutshell.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.730
They they should not not be doing schedule management.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:44.960
They may have a role in certain design functions but even then if you have a designer I

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.770
would prefer to go talk to those guys then to program management in a nutshell.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:34:00.360
They're there to take on the customer focus wing of software development.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.120
I like the idea you brought up they don't own the schedule from an agile point of view.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.970
Those familiar with the role of a P.O. product owner.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:19.370
I think the there on a unified engineering team you could pretty much just look up any

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:25.250
definition of a product owner and be pretty well so that's you jumped way ahead.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.530
I was going to talk about and it's good thing.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:33.250
I was going to talk about schedule a little bit and what happened there and then I was going to

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:37.730
make a profound statement and say a profound question and ask Brent.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.490
Do you think the P.M. role is moving to much more of an agile project owner role.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.620
Yes product owner role and I think you're right.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.700
I do my best to push it there.

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:54.020
I don't think it's moving there at least in my world it's not moving there.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.700
So let me tell you in the Skype consumer org that's the role of the P.M.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.180
It's a P.O.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.540
We have product owners.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:34:59.860
Yep.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.100
Like it like it.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:09.500
My team is still a little bit in the old world of project management which is

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.500
interesting because I will tell you I don't have any problems putting laundry on the

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:13.900
table.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.300
Love the product.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.540
Love the team.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.940
There comes a point when you're moving as we're moving where P.M.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.540
in the old role tends to get in the way a little bit.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.540
It does.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.540
It does.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.900
And and they should be enabling.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:31.170
They are.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.460
P.M.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:42.700
is another function that of command and control that's still trying to keep itself

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.220
alive.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:43.660
It is.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:49.340
So I think our good friend Jim Moore once described the role of test or often

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.740
described the role of test as the remainder.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.180
Dev do the implementation and coding P.M.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.260
do the design and scheduling and the remainder is done by test.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.980
Whatever and other you know Dev and P.M.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.860
may pick up more of that but test does the remainder.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:08.890
Unified engineering team the engineering team owns scheduling and

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:12.370
implementation and testing and quality and deployment etcetera.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.050
The P.O.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.620
you could think of as the new owner of the remainder.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.830
No the P.O.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.190
I like I like the idea of the P.M.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.990
moving to the P.O.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.710
Yes it's a distinct set of stuff that a P.O.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:28.150
does.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.350
It's not the remainder.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.750
Right.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:36.030
The pro the transitional problem is as bluntly we have too many P.M.s.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:36.790
Yes.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:40.630
So in and the we don't need as many P.M.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.350
as we have for the P.O.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:42.790
role.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.140
So I want to have them pick up the remainder purely as job security for my

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.500
friends still stuck in that role.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.260
Yeah and I'm going to say screw that.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.260
I'm going to say screw that in the long run but that's that the reason I brought

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:02.100
up as the remainder is because there's a transitional period in similar to how

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.100
there's been in test where testers have figured out former testers have

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.780
figured out where to sort of belong in the new world and most of them have.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.580
And I guess in the same way we had to go through it.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:13.980
P.M.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.700
should figure out where they belong in that world too.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:17.670
I completely agree.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.950
The I'll walk through.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:26.910
So I first encountered this this this P.M.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:37.780
drama about five years ago when when I went to Bing and as as I wrote on my blog post at

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.140
Microsoft the U.E.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:50.720
trans transformation started in Bing literally just a month before I joined in one of the I'd be

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.960
funded several P.M.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.160
is there and there was a period where they were confused in terms of what value they had

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:05.920
and then some started focusing on customer stuff and started succeeding on this but even

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:12.740
those guys felt that it wasn't going to persist right.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:18.900
The because a lot of the data they were looking at so Bing's rich in data and a lot of the

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.340
data they were looking at was essentially which customers are were pissing off.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:28.960
They were focusing on D sat not C sat and they're like I don't know what I'm to do

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:35.600
because we're busily building up all of these great data tools and shortly the dev will be

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.640
able to figure out what's pissing off customers readily without me.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.860
And I'm like right.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.300
And that's the way it should be.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:50.340
But dev can't focus on what are the new opportunities that we have no code for.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:51.530
Right.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.970
That's what you should be doing.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.930
That's you should be designing a B experiments.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:01.930
You should be thinking through what are opportunities that we can either grow our market or

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:14.600
increase revenue from our existing market and use your quality intuition skills to

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.760
generate a list of opportunities that we can run through and test very quickly.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.480
I agree.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.200
I agree.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.000
And so what that means it goes into Steve's third question about shifts to development or

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.760
shifts to the members of the unified engineering team is that there are some old some

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:44.300
skills some tasks activities some activities previously done by PM belong on the dev team.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.820
And like you thought the devs didn't want to do testing they don't want to do PM crap.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.500
It's more efficient for it to be there.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:59.020
And it further to me it further emphasizes the need for generalizing specialists and

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.740
specializing generalists on your unified engineering team.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.100
Some people are going to be good at different things.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.900
Some people just want to be told what to do.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.900
Some people want to help figure out what to do.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.620
There is room for all of those.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.140
In fact you need all of those.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:19.100
You need a mix of skills and a mix of interests to have a successful unified

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:19.660
engineering team.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.660
I think it's much more efficient when you start moving a chunk of that previously owned

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:30.320
of the activities when you move a chunk of the previously owned activities from PM

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.080
to a unified engineering team.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.800
So I'm full behind that.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.840
I don't know exactly how that transition happens because right now the unfortunately

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:44.080
in most parts of Microsoft the PM role is much about wanting to get their thumbs in a

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.440
lot of different areas and having that wide exposure.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:52.960
The program management role is a lot about I coordinate I schedule I know you don't.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.560
You know I think I think it's the next step.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.280
I think it's in a team like Microsoft or organization like Microsoft or in a team

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.360
structure like these Microsoft orgs with it's not like we have like a one to one

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:14.080
PM to dev ratio but we I would say in general we have far more than we need.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:22.680
I would and we need to think are far more and I think that's the next step in our evolution as a

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.120
company.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.440
We made a lot of strides in evolution how we make software.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.260
I'm across most orgs at Microsoft.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.940
I'm very proud.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.340
I talked to no assessment shout out.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:34.940
Thank you.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.420
Thank you.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.540
Thank you again Noah.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.500
Noah was at Etsy.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.140
He helped.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.540
He helped take Etsy from the sort of the shipping weekly monthly to continuous deployment.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.900
He knows what he's doing and I talked to him about what we're doing wanted to get his feedback and

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.860
and I feel like we're actually making software like a real company on my team.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.980
I'm very excited about that.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.700
I like Oh my God we're doing it right.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.580
We're getting there.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:00.900
Very exciting for me.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:07.980
And I think despite despite I don't want to throw all PMs under the bus they mean well but I think the

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:13.900
next stage in the evolution of engineering at Microsoft at least is to evolve that PM role into

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.500
something more supportive of a efficient unified engineering team.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:28.710
One of the one of the PM's that I worked with a lot in being left teams four years ago and he asked me

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:38.740
to come in and help train up his current team on agile practices in particular Kanban and I met him

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.700
couple of months ago.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.660
I happened to do a presentation for H.R.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.340
And he was in the room and he's like dude we need to sync up.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:57.500
I've gotten my whole 300 person org executing using Kanban.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.100
And it's the happiest I've seen him.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.100
Right.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:11.800
It's the PM role when when they simultaneously do things let go of command and control and stay

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:18.760
consistent on maximize business value and customer value.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.200
It ends up being a lot of work for them.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.240
They keep themselves busy.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:31.040
You're able to prune off the crappy folks and when we get rid of command and control right.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.410
They become so in P.O. you know the role of acceptance testing.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:42.190
So what is an acceptance test in a scrum model.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.210
The P.O. does the acceptance test.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.240
Okay.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.260
Do they do any testing.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.710
Sure.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:51.190
No.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.830
None.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.750
None.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:53.590
None.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:59.590
This is something that is very the best acceptance test.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.610
The product isn't even there.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.460
So the role of the P.O. right when when you're doing agile the P.O.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:20.260
Sets down and says these are the outcomes these are the use cases I want solved and then we'll generate a definition of done that is not the ideally not framed in.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.860
No I get that.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:22.260
Right.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:33.820
Well so then the dev team wants to claim that they're done and so they do they sit with the P.O.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:46.330
The best P.O.s will do a bunch of precision questioning around how did you assure that this fulfilled that requirement.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.640
The worst P.O.s will open up the product and retested themselves.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:59.220
The Intel has gone through that acceptance review and it's more of a precision.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:10.820
Alan explained to me so this this particular situation the outcome was it needed to scale out very high.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:11.580
Right.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:18.180
And then let's say I mad it needs to scale out to end instances of whatever is important to your team.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:18.940
Okay.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.180
How did you prove it did that.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.050
I launched a bunch of VMs and VMs and deployed and it was fun.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:27.820
For how long.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.260
Just like a minute.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.540
What's right.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.820
And so and so that is an end.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:42.150
I don't struggle with that from the idea of like that's the right thing to do.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.510
I struggle with that is those.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:49.230
I was talking before about the transition from P.M. to P.O.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.230
Most the P.M. I know can't become that P.O. it's a different person.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.590
They can't.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:46:02.050
There are there are several that that I am aware of that are working in most several others are.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:02.890
Let me put it this way.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.130
I think it's a difficult transition.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:14.630
The thing I'm addressing because the one pattern that I saw in my last team when when P.M. started going through this thing.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.160
That it literally was P.M. becoming the remainder.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:24.050
And I I saw it from day one.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:28.130
The the codependency loop being reconstructed.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:35.220
Yeah I could see that and I would go to P.M. and say when you are signing off on this thing.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.830
You should not even have the product in the room.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:44.230
I see where you're coming from and there is an interesting parallel here.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:45.910
A lot of teams at Microsoft.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:52.710
When moving to the unified engineering they decided that OK most you testers are now data scientists.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:47:01.890
And some of them embraced it and and figured it out and became really good data scientists and a bunch of others just waving their hands around trying to figure out what it means.

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:11.410
I see the same thing happening in the P.M. to P.O. some will get it and embrace it and be excellent at it and there'll be a bunch more kind of way of their hands and figure it out what it means.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.370
On my current team the majority of the P.M.s.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:28.750
There are I would say it's 75 25 25 percent are still holding on with white knuckles to the old world but the majority of the P.M.s that I'm I'm working with.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:40.320
They're coming to me and say hey Brent I want to I want to sit with you and see if we have the data because I have this idea for a business opportunity.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.900
And I want to see if the data sort of aligns with this intuition.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:48:01.770
And for example there's there's one new feature that we're going to fund in Azure that directly came from me and this one P.M. working together and realizing that yeah it does look fine.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:17.180
So he then I then pulled in a list of internal customers on Azure and he's now going through and doing a road show and testing out whether or not the internals.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.460
I just said he was testing.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:26.390
He's testing out whether or not this would be a valuable thing to those guys.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.070
Remember Brent words have meaning.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.590
They do.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:31.550
They run a time.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.670
Fun episode 41.

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:35.950
It was a fun 41.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.270
Next one's up is 42.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.230
All right. I'm Alan. I'm Brett.
