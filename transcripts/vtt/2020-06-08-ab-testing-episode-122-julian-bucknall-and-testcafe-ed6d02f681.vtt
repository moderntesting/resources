Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.580
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.050
Hey everyone

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050
Brett say something. Hi

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.250
All right

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.300
But you said hey everyone like that was for the list that was for the three people

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.600
Brit you're you remain the smartest idiot I've ever known but luckily we have someone even smarter joining us on our

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.140
our

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.460
Socially distanced podcast this morning. We have Julian Bucknell who is the CTO of test cafe? Hey Julian and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Good morning. It's well, it's morning for me. Yeah

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.180
Hello

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.520
Long-time listeners may know that we we record it 8 a.m

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.140
On Fridays usually so are welcome to have Julian get up early for us. Which part of the world are you in Julian?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.420
I'm actually in Colorado. So it's it's not an early morning for me. It's it's pretty good. I mean I've got my

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.500
Starbucks coffee which I went to him, you know a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.660
Drive-thru

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.660
To get and I'm ready

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.260
It's

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Ready for the the morning's work

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.500
All right. Wait, you introduced me as the CTO of test cafe. I actually am the CTO of developer Express who

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.570
Create and market test. Thank you for the clarification. What else does dev express do we are mostly about

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.470
Kind of user interface controls for for developers across the gamut from Windows

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.790
to the web and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.170
You know, I can get into why we created test cafe because you know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.010
we have all these user interface controls for the web and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.030
We need to test them and so on so forth. But yeah, we we basically target developers

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.670
creating applications

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.150
you know either for Windows or for the web or

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.070
It's getting more and more things like the Mac and and so on so forth. It's it's getting very interesting

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.190
Yes, indeed and I like that you said you cater towards developers

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.830
I don't I didn't mention this earlier in our pre-show talk, but I

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.350
My role is difficult to describe. I run engineering systems for an org of about 250 people and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.070
We don't have any dedicated QA. In fact, we have a lot of people doing testing. They're also called developers and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.430
many of our developers for the parts of our

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.110
Our product that are in UI are using test cafe and I have played with it in the past for some prototyping

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.110
And I have to say I'm a fan

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.110
so I am curious why in a world where

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.950
Selenium is ubiquitous. Did you like what was the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.550
Where'd you where'd you come from here? Well, the thing was this is my word. This is probably about seven years ago now

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.430
Yes, we we developed

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.630
Web controls

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.190
controls for web applications

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.370
so, you know the boring things like menus and buttons and all that kind of stuff we have a

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.470
theming thing we have grids and spreadsheets and

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.710
Previews and dashboards now and all that kind of stuff and the big problem without this is yeah, we can write

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.750
our own

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.070
Tests or the developers can write their own tests

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.730
to a certain extent when you're talking about things like

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.950
unit tests or integration tests and so on a functional testing but

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.790
When you're talking about the web

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.540
as

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.060
I'm sure you both know and all everybody listening knows

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.450
You're not actually running the web app on its own. You're running it inside a browser and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.510
We ran into the problem with Selenium

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.470
Which I'm sure a lot of people run into is in order to test an application say

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.310
test your user interface you've got to

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.830
Install something inside your browser. I think it's called web driver or something like that and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.510
And that becomes a problem. You can't just you know start up a browser and say, okay

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.670
Let me test this particular piece of my application or this particular piece of the UI

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.150
Am I getting the right results from my back end and so on so forth?

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.230
and so we we started to run into these problems and

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.110
Pure JavaScript controls were originally written for the mobile market

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.230
so we talk about phones which were tablets and all that kind of stuff and

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.830
Selenium tablets the phones

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.070
No, so we had to basically come up with an idea

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.750
Some kind of tool that we could use to test our own user interface controls on mobile devices

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.510
Automatically and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.490
You know put it inside our continuous integration

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.870
Service and all that kind of stuff. And so we started off in test cafe

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.070
I remember when we first launched it. I think was 2013

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.870
There was a big conference in San Francisco an HTML 5 conference or some description

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.190
and so we had a booth there and we were showing it off and

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.830
and I had my

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.770
my Kindle and

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.310
You know, we were showing everybody that oh it runs on this laptop that we have here and there's Julian with his Kindle

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.510
Look, then test cafe was working on the Kindle

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.990
Yes, we love doing stuff like that

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.410
And it kind of grew from there really people got enthusiastic about it

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:30.950
The thing is with test cafe, I'm sure you know is you write your tests in JavaScript

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.590
So not only you writing JavaScript for your web app

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.080
You're also writing JavaScript for your tests

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.360
You're not having to learn something new. You're not having to install something new. It's just

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.290
You know, it's no JS essentially a nice

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.290
framework for no JS

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:58.110
Can install it with NPM and you know, it's dead easy and as I say you don't have to install

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.550
Anything on the browser to make it from the test

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.020
The thing was that you know at that point

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.460
We realized there were a lot of people out there who would like it even

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.400
We just have a user interface which ran in the browser and

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.200
People saying yeah, but you're not doing this you're not doing that

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:29.100
So we basically stopped developing user interface and we decided to create an open source

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.200
framework for test cafe

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.800
And

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.560
Then once that was popular

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.960
create a better

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.680
dashboard style or studio style

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.840
Interface for recording tests and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, you can you can download it from

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.080
GitHub it's open source project. We get a lot of

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.580
Feedback from from people who are using it

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.160
and so on so forth it's

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.120
It's been a it's been a journey

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:13.760
Yeah, so I briefly my experience touched on this a little bit in our pre podcast talk, but

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.760
Many years ago when I was still at Microsoft as a Microsoft for a long time with Brent

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.760
That's where we met tonight. I've moved on from there about three years ago. I

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.040
My last job there. I ran a team where the developers were using

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.920
Slow down protractor for an angular website and

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.400
one of the things that

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.660
Bugged me was that the only browser we could get all of our tests to run on consistently was Chrome

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.720
There were various issues with Firefox more issues with ie and granted. This is now five or six years ago

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.720
Five well three four four or five years ago. I can do the math here

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.360
So when I got a chance to prototype test cafe just to let you know

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.380
My experience as a user it was NPM install test cafe

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.340
Open some you look at the docks write a little code go

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:09.000
Oh, wow, this just runs and then try a different browser and it just runs and I wrote more extensive tests

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.620
And not only did I write I just wrote a little

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.400
Basic test for one page to create some random project names for us. This was an angular set at the time and

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.980
It was pretty easy to get a basic test up and running

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.180
Ended up having to do a lot more and I'm gonna really anger the Selenium crowd

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.940
I'm not against Selenium as everybody knows we had Jason Huggins on the show last year to talk about it's a lot of value to it

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.100
But as far as quick

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.220
Getting things up and running it worked really well for me and those tests ran with only one

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.180
Air when someone pulled them out and dusted them off to build on them

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.740
Six or eight months after I wrote them. So I think that's a testament to

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.460
How well things work?

00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:01.020
I'm a little bit removed from that but I remember in Selenium a lot of waiting for elements to appear which

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.780
You have to do a little bit of a test cafe

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.940
But it's a little smarter about not needing to write these massive nested

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:15.820
Weights and checks so a big fan. So this is all leading to a question. So when I first used test cafe, I

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.500
posted

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.100
Eventually Alan gets somewhere. I posted to Twitter and said hey because I haven't done a lot of web automation. I

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:31.180
Said I've used test cat facings to work pretty well and what am I missing? What's what?

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.180
Why isn't this a bigger deal and the feedback I get from my followers who use

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.820
And others who are forwarded. There's a lot of Selenium folks out there

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:47.420
We're really just two things and maybe watch you address these and kind of get rather than my opinion your opinion

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:55.060
One was which I will actually argue with first one was will it inject JavaScript into your website?

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.060
So it's not the real site customers are seeing

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.900
I thought that is and just I'll just dismiss that one is lame

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.020
but the second one is

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:09.900
But web it doesn't use webdriver and webdriver is w3c c standard w3c standard and

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:17.940
My answer to that was so and they said but it's a standard and I said so and they said but it's a standard

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.780
But you may have a better answer to that question. So I'll leave you with that to comment on

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
My my viewpoint

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:33.940
Just to go back. I mean we create these user interface controls written in JavaScript for web applications

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.300
And the thing is we don't just say

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.020
these controls only work in Chrome or Firefox or

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:47.050
Safari or whatever edge. Yeah, that was the other one edge. Ha

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.250
Yeah, we say it's you know, it's a

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:58.130
User interface control for the web and it should work in any browser and what we get is if we get it wrong

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:06.130
We get you know a support question or whatever it happens to be. Hey, I'm using this version of Safari and your web

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.730
Your user interface control doesn't work

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.070
And so we have to basically, you know

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:18.750
Boot up some Safari or other and check it out. The problem is

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:26.530
Once you fixed whatever issue it was in whatever particular browser it was

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.210
You've got to repeat that test forevermore

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:36.610
It's part of your test suite at that point because you don't want to revert to a buggy

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
Version and so on so forth

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.290
So that's you know

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.930
emphasizing the fact that

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.490
Yes, web driver may be

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.050
W3C

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.610
Compatible and all the rest of it, but it's not in every browser

00:12:53.570 --> 00:13:00.210
It's not there if I download and install Firefox, it's not there you have to then install

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.010
something else and

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.290
And you know if I come my

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.250
I'm old-fashioned. I've got an iPhone 6

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:17.890
It's you know, the operating system is version 12 of iOS not version 13. It won't go up any further

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.370
so at some point, you know

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.740
I'm just saying

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.740
We're going to create a user interface control or some feature and other and it's just not going to work on my iPhone 6

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.100
And i'll be able to say okay guys, you know sort this out

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.330
but with selenium

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.550
until

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.750
If you like the web driver becomes like

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.750
um

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.670
The big thing everyone's talking about these days is wasm web assembly

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:56.290
Every browser now has web assembly built into the browser so you could now write applications

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.150
Which target web assembly fine?

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.030
web driver is not like that

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.430
and um, so

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.470
You know for us in particular

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.310
Uh emphasizes the fact that we needed

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.110
something which went beyond

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:20.190
Um what selenium could do because we have customers out there across the world

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.910
Using a wild variety of different browsers, so we cannot

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.270
Just say oh, sorry. You're using internet explorer 11

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.590
You would believe the number of people you still use internet explorer 11

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
Um, I would because i've run those

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.750
Because we had to when I when I had web apps

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:46.590
At microsoft I would look at browser percentage and at the time again four or five years ago

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.130
At I was surprised how many people were running ie8

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:57.470
Yeah, absolutely. I mean it is it can be absolutely crazy, but then you start thinking about okay

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.510
It's a legacy app and you know, we haven't upgraded all our users

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:10.590
So on so on so on I mean, I wonder how many people out there are using the new microsoft edge for example if they're using edge

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.550
Did they actually do the extra step to install this brand new chrome based edge?

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.030
Brand you you're probably using chrome edge

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.080
Uh not by purpose. No

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.520
Do you call it credge internally?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.080
No, we do not we do not

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.400
I'm gonna offer that up for free

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.000
Just pass that along to satya or the ie team directly

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.280
If it goes that way it's already going to get translated to frames internally. Oh, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said microsoft

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
I'm sorry. Credge for business

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.360
No, so like the

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.400
the

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.940
uh

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.940
I do think going with the chrome

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.180
Architecture was a net positive for edge

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.660
Uh, I don't think there's much disagreement there not for me

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.500
No, no

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.540
but

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.740
Like to me, I think there's a bit of a branding problem right now because I think the majority

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.140
About if I were in the right position

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.460
Once I made the decision to go with the chrome back in I would have rebranded

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.760
Right because I think I think edge is synonymous with

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.440
pain

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.480
in in

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.600
the world market

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.560
That's just my opinion and satya listens to this and what's the question me on it?

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.960
Um, I'll still stand by that even though I have no data to prove it one way or the other

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.150
um

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.150
couple couple of things, uh

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.710
So i'm currently stocking

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.190
julian on linkedin

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:55.250
Oh and I see he actually has spent time at microsoft as well

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.130
Yes, that was a while back

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.250
I was at microsoft for about a year. Um

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.050
I was brought on um

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:07.890
because

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.090
The visual studio team were about to release visual studio

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.790
2003

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:23.230
And if you know your visual studio history, there was no visual studio 2003 because there was a major cockup

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.830
And so it became visual studio 2005 and so I was brought into you know

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.900
in theory to

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.460
provide

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:41.580
I was program manager to provide ideas and thoughts about what the next version of visual studio would would have and

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.100
Would be doing and so on so forth except that

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.020
I was brought in and everything had been decided and

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.300
We were doing visual studio 2000, what's it called? Um codename whitby

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.680
It's kind of interesting. I remember these things. Wow. Yeah

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.800
C-sharp was getting um generics. That was the big thing about it

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.570
I remember when generics came out those were cool. Uh,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.810
So you remember when wittaker was in dev dev

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.930
Was it around that time frame?

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:24.770
It might have been so barton barton was running their massive qa org

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:30.450
But when did I don't remember when wittaker's first stint at microsoft began and ended?

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.850
But yeah about that time he actually might have come a little bit later

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.490
Yeah, was was tfs a thing then julian?

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.450
Tfs was just starting

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.450
It hadn't the team foundation server

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.550
I I I

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.070
No, that was later i'm sure i'm trying to get back now

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.580
I mean i've i've been with dev express now 14 years. So it's like

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.250
you know

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.290
I forgot I forgot most of those days at microsoft. It was uh,

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:07.570
It was fun, but I just didn't fit in at that particular point. Unfortunately, so all right

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:14.130
I had to give your yearbook away. No, that makes that makes perfect sense like like um

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.800
You know, he started this question with sort of a web driver

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.600
Is the standard thing right in in the somewhat of a?

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.940
cyclical argument in my view standards change

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.660
right, uh, I

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.660
Just happened to be looking

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.780
uh

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.580
Uh in right now I found a page that talks about laws that have changed

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.700
Right there was a law apparently in washington in 1969 where it

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.540
Made it a felony and punishable by five years in prison if you um

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.640
Slayed bigfoot

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.270
Where are you going with this?

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.950
No, I I'm just

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.950
Which page you've got up?

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.650
So so that law that law was in 1969

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.070
In and in the context back then there was there

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.270
Either this was a complete joke or

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:23.180
Uh in in the people who passed that a lot had nothing else better to do or there was some evidence or a real strong belief

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:31.010
That bigfoot is a creature that needs to be protected. My my point is is that as time advances?

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.010
We create new tech new standards need to be

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.490
Uh

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.490
Standards need to be reconsidered

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.690
right, um

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.730
Qa certification

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:51.560
Right. There's still a lot of standards in in in the eu around qa certification

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.540
And and as an example i'd make a large argument

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.260
that those standards are

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.240
Contradictory, uh to to many marketplaces today

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.300
Not all but many

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.540
I I I

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:17.380
Alan you you sort of just immediately bit flip the javascript argument. Likewise. I bit flipped the web driver argument

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.940
um, alan

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.340
Well, actually i'll i'll ask one question that i'm very curious about so

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:30.340
Dev express targets deaths, right? We we talked about at the very beginning. It's very

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.340
fascinating

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.340
What about test cafe?

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.180
Specifically do you have any sort of sense of

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.560
If you can share this sort of your your customer segmentation

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.860
around

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.540
Uh a developer versus a a traditional

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.820
Uh ui tester or ui automator

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.000
Uh, so

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.880
So let me let me approach that in in a slightly

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.360
weird way

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.480
Originally, we wrote test cafe for developers because we as a company

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.680
market to developers essentially

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.360
um

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.000
As I said, we do user interface controls across the board

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.160
and so originally test cafe was targeted towards developers and those developers would be

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.000
Fairly proficient in javascript as I said we're talking about five six seven years ago

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.920
um

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.720
and

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.720
what we found was

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.920
that

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.920
The developers were saying

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.080
This is too simplistic

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.540
um

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.540
For us to use you've got to

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.300
broaden it and you've got to

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.900
Make it easier to program to

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:55.180
Um, and so on so forth. So that's why we split test cafe away from its user interface to

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.660
a pure

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.660
javascript framework essentially

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.180
And that was made open source and blah blah blah blah

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.620
And then we went back to the user interface to say

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.220
Okay

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.220
We know that developers

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.980
will um

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.740
I'm going to say the word enjoy using test cafe because

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:22.620
You know, they're writing web applications and writing some javascript and they know javascript and they can write javascript to do their tests

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.220
brilliant

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.620
Now we have to target those people who

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.740
Maybe don't know javascript as well

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.620
but are

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.820
Qa people testing people people who

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.620
basically

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.210
are

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.330
If you like away from that developer mentality and go

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:50.370
How is this application really going to work and how easy is it to use and how can we test the

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.310
usability of this application

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.830
Easily and quickly which is when we produced test cafe studio, which has

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.070
basically a visual

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.510
test recorder

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.350
So yeah a developer could go in with the studio and say all right

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:12.510
Here's my web page and i'm going to press this button i'm expecting this to happen and you know these

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:19.710
Elements to be updated and so on so forth and they could actually just record that using

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.190
the visual

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.910
Test recorder instead of actually, you know trying to write the javascript and

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.430
Oh, they're using or really and they need

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:37.470
You know an extra bit of code to actually access the elements and and so on so forth

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:42.270
so we originally started targeting developers, but with the

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.510
User interface either studio side or

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.910
It's going to migrate into a kind of dashboard type

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.810
application

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.430
um

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.430
You know, we're we're then

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.270
Basically saying okay developers you have a qa team

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.950
Um who may not be as proficient in javascript as you are

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:09.470
And you don't want them to come to you to say write me this test, please because i've got to run it

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.550
You know add infinitum every day

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.270
uh in my integrated test suite

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.070
um

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.270
that's

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.550
The whole point where we thought okay, we have to target

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.070
um

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.230
Uh the testing environment in these companies these uh corporations

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.110
and make it easier for them to

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:35.470
Create a suite of tests to run that suite of tests as part of some integration

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.230
um

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.350
and

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.350
So on so forth so it's um

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.550
We're not we're not saying

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:49.900
Oh developers you've been doing it wrong. Here's a great new studio, which will help you do it better

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.540
And we're not saying to the testers. Oh, i'm sorry. You don't know javascript that well

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.140
Here's something to make it easier for it. No, we're basically saying

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.640
Writing tests is

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.960
I mean, there's so many different types of tests you've got you know, as I said units integration tests functional testing

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.040
Which is very developer based

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.040
um performance testing

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:20.220
Hmm in usability testing the thing that fascinates me most and um,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.160
uh as uh

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.160
Cto at dev express no

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.050
I'm very into usability

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.110
Unfortunately these days I don't do much development

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:38.810
Um, you know, I started off years ago as a developer, but I don't do much development nowadays. So I tend to look at things

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.370
from a

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.910
User standpoint more than a developer standpoint

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.970
so usability testing for me is is something that's

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.650
interesting and um

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:58.250
I I really want to get more into and um, you know to be able to look at our

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.130
particular controls and to say

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.330
Yes, they're usable if the user

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:12.410
Comes across an application written with our controls. They know how to use the application. They're not searching around

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:18.090
You know the window going well, what do I do to do this? It gets obvious

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.980
um, and you know test cafe is all about that it's uh, um,

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.740
especially the studio side of things it's the ability for

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.340
um

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.900
Qa testers to actually

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:39.500
Write tests which show that an application is usable and continues to be usable

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.500
so

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.820
I don't know the state of the art today on test recorders

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.740
when

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:53.100
When I started this this was back in oh my god ms test was when it started

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.300
Ooh

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.220
Are those who remember that? I I I was a beta user

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.620
um

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:05.340
and one of the traditional problems with this is they were

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:12.780
They were absolutely great for very quickly creating a bunch of repeatable tests

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.980
As long as your developers didn't check in any changes

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:27.620
Uh, then it very quickly then it very quickly became a maintenance nightmare often with people who didn't understand

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.280
Uh the code being produced

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.580
um

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.580
What's the what's the state of the art on?

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.180
that

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.780
that's

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:47.980
That's that's that kind of a broad question because if you like we suffer from that from our um, you know main

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.820
um thrust of our um our company is

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.020
Breaking changes, you know, we're we

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.960
So let's say we produce a control

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.800
Um people like it and they want some changes and they want this feature and that feature and all that kind of stuff

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.160
It's very easy at that point to say, you know

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.520
We thought about doing abc with this control at the beginning

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.640
but it turns out that c is not really required it really ought to be d and

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.720
We make the change and it's a breaking change and

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.680
Yes, we have to tell our

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.000
Customers that yet there is a breaking change

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:32.640
Uh, it won't work in the same way as it did in the previous version and all that kind of stuff and the one thing about test cafe

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.240
video

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.080
Test recorder is that it's actually writing the stuff as javascript in the background

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.320
So it's not some weird and wonderful

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.680
Database there and we're just doing some wacky sql to

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.720
Put the test into the database and all that kind of stuff. No, it's just a javascript file

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.480
so

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.560
In one sense, it's uh fairly easy to make changes

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.480
Yes, the developers can do something which will break a test

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.400
as the test broken because the change made was

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:15.360
Um bad or was the breaking change a good breaking change in this case you have to change the test for sure

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.880
and it's easier to change the test if it's just

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.600
You know language, you know and can just quickly change or re-record the test with the new

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.480
Um new outcome that you're expecting from this new feature

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:38.350
Yeah, so to build on what with what brent asked and as answer part of it myself in the old days of windows ui automation

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:45.290
People would change an id of a control or the tab or a tab order or something that would screw up all your automation

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.770
in the web world brent the

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.540
If people

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:57.900
Have auto generated or randomly named or or usually unnamed controls things get weird even in test cafe

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:03.420
I had one control in that little suite. I wrote that didn't have an easy way to access

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.580
so I had to make a constant with

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.400
with the

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.800
Totally ugly selector name and we went back and changed it later

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:19.280
But the way you get around those tests breaking is you you give your controls ids with sensible names

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.760
That makes them easier to access

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.600
So which is one of the reasons I think it's critical

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.840
Whether you're using selenium or test cafe or any of the other tools around this is that for that

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.680
Unit level that basic bvt of ui wouldn't be unit level test

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.160
But that basic bvt of ui like are my controls there and they do

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.840
I'm beginning not testing logic is the stuff where I want it to be

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.480
Have the devs write that because they're going to feel that pain right away and go fix

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.280
Yeah, and I mean

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.800
We don't have qa on our team, but if they if they go oh wait, this is stupid

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:03.200
Why am I doing it this way? That's such an efficiency boom rather than the if you have a like there are some

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:09.920
organizations where a tester writes test cases and an automation team goes to automate them and the back and

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.720
forth between those layers and the developer

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.600
Just it's it's an inefficient game of ping pong that drives me nuts

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.480
So let's take care of and maybe if you have that automation team, which i'm not a fan of

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:30.160
I'm not against having qa teams. I think it makes sense, especially in a in a ui centric application, but get that basic

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.680
Testing that that first level of testing done by the dev team have them own those tests

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.240
Because if not you're going to be playing a constant game of back and forth and back and forth the entire time you're building your product

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.800
And it's just a horrible way to make software

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.360
That's a that's a good point actually

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.040
And one of the things we discovered is yes

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:58.800
Uh test cafe will record a test saying is the 13th child of this particular parent because you haven't actually given it an id

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.960
And yeah, something will break pretty quickly at that particular point

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.080
Um, which is why we also have

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.240
Not only pure if you like css

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.000
um

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.800
Classes and ids that we can search for and use and all that kind of stuff. We also have

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.360
the ability to

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.360
um have

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:26.190
Format format framework specific

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:31.070
Um selectors, so if you're using react for example react is

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:38.430
If you like notorious for hiding things from you because it creates an old separate dom and you know

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:45.230
What do we do about that in test cafe? Well answer is we have a react

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.270
plugin if you like which knows about react and knows how to get

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:57.310
uh to a particular control or a particular element in the react dom tree to be able to

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.650
ascertain its

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.630
status and

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.140
What it's showing or whatever

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:11.740
But yeah, that's an excellent way of putting it if your developers can't write the test then

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.620
Nobody else could

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:22.380
Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance a book on the philosophy of quality basically says quality and care are two sides of the same coin

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.140
If I look at my work, if I look at a string of random

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:33.870
Glued greater than signs and strings that that that is a thing in my test. I am not proud of that work

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:40.190
Right, and I want to be proud of what I make whether it's a test or production code or or even a project

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.910
I like to be proud of my work. Uh, I want to

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.320
Ask you a different question

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.600
And I think it's fair for because again a lot of people

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.080
I don't I don't think it's any mystery to you. There are more selenium users and there are test cafe users

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.680
I haven't looked up that number, but I'm pretty sure I can say that I feel I have a high confidence. That's correct

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.160
What are some for the selenium crowd maybe because i'll get questions about this maybe let's preempt some of those

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:16.880
What are some things you think selenium does better than test cafe or or or a reason you would use selenium in some instance over test cafe?

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.120
that's a question that I really could not answer because I

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.360
Personally have never used selenium. So I

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.980
I

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:35.820
I just don't know. I am to officially outsource that question then because I don't know either

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.980
I

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.100
I mean I get I get the point that selenium has been around

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.420
the longest

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.840
so

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.440
So actually I have one maybe we can talk through because I haven't thought about this

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.640
But I think I think I can talk through it. Maybe you can help me with it

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.160
is

00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:00.520
One of the things that were built on top of selenium is selenium grid the ability to have a basically a server farm run a whole

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.960
bunch of things

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.720
you test across a whole bunch of browsers and a whole bunch of

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.250
permutations

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:13.370
I'm as I say that because I brought i'm just trying to think I think I could duplicate

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.170
All of that in a modern ci system

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.290
Is that something that's come up with you?

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:21.610
Has anybody ever asked like I want to run this across on every build across

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.410
16 different browser and os flavors

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:30.570
Would they just use test cafe on something like browser stack or like what will be your what would be your answer to that?

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:37.370
That question that's something that we are continuing to improve. Let's put it like that the ability to run

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.550
Test suites concurrently

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.550
and

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.240
it's

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.600
Quite unquite difficult, but it's still it works at the moment. We

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.080
The other thing is to go back is

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.080
We get an awful lot

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.720
these days

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.380
Of people are using sites like source labs

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.700
To run their application on multiple different mobile devices

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.740
And yes, we'll do that in quite parallel. Uh, unquote

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.770
Um

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:23.370
Which again, you know selenium is more geared towards your desktop browser

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:28.730
Experience and not necessarily. Oh i'm running it on a very smaller

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:36.970
Very smaller and a smaller screen and you know, these things disappear until you hit the hamburger menu

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.370
Icon and stuff like that

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:44.090
The way test cafe works is it uses a proxy server essentially

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.040
so

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.400
It's end-to-end testing and test cafes in the middle. So

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.160
If your browser asks for a particular, you know

00:37:54.790 --> 00:38:02.170
HTTP request test cafe receives the HTTP request recognizes it sends it on to the actual back end

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:10.650
And then when the back end replies will then pass that reply over to the browser and um

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.900
Um

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:18.780
You know inject if you like it's uh its own test, uh information

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:25.340
Uh so that it can verify that test is running. Okay, and all the rest of it that server

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.460
proxy server will

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.860
work with multiple

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.920
browsers at the same time

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.180
So you can basically with test cafe set it up so that

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.620
You know it'll run

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.940
even on a desktop

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:50.780
Chrome and firefox and edge all at the same time running the same test for the same application and so on so forth

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:59.180
But I would guess that selenium if you like does it better because it's it's an actual application. It's uh, you know, it's

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.560
Giving the whole hog as it were

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.250
Yeah, I think in

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:12.970
So let me talk through this. I haven't thought through this completely but because the installation is just an npm install

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:20.170
Yeah, uh, it's it makes it fairly easy. Well, not fairly makes it extremely easy to add to my

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:24.490
My ci workflow. I just added I add a step that's

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:30.890
Uh, there's a setup step for npm install and then it runs the test results get reported and I can definitely

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:38.350
in parallel send that that that step to multiple locations whether it's on a farm or

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:43.150
Or I can specify where I want those to run. So that should work and i'm sure and again

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:49.550
I have used selenium protractor fairly extensively, but again, this is years ago. I I don't have the data

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.710
But uh, my experiences are similar, but i'm actually looking forward to hearing

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:59.790
Uh what our listeners have to say and if you're fairly new to the podcast if you go back to

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:04.050
About a year ago one of the early posts from 2019

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:08.850
I think that's what it was. We had jason huggins on the podcast

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.820
in response to a tweet

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:16.220
Actually, this was better brought up a minute ago. We're talking about ids

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:22.380
I had come across a blog post and someone talking about how they solved the problem in selenium

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.700
And they're very proud of this code

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.660
And I looked and talked about looking at code and saying am I proud of this?

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.300
They were very proud of code that I thought was

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.440
ugly

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.040
Unfarrassingly ugly. It was a long string of

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.200
Of the selector they had to choose to get it get access to the control

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.160
And I tweeted something crass like reason

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.420
438 why I hate selenium

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:56.680
And the community exploded against me and told me I I couldn't hate selenium and it's not I don't actually I I think selenium is great

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.640
Uh, it solves it solves a huge problem

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.040
What I didn't like is that it enabled that stuff. This is true also in test cafe

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.320
but it started a nice little war, uh, one of the

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.480
the contributors to web driver was extremely mad at me and and gave me uh,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.800
I'll just say some grief over twitter

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.720
and I

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.600
We ended up having jason on the show to talk about it and he was actually he was super pleasant and he got it and

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.000
He asked he tried to bait brent and I with a uh, a question

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.320
Well, should should selenium just not support selector? So that make it easier said no

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.920
We should you've you've you have legacy of a million different tests. You can't just go break them

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.560
Uh, I think in a way he was acknowledging it that part kind of created a monster

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.880
But the point I wanted to make was not that I hate selenium

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:51.760
Uh, I hate hated the way it was being used the way people like again going back to my statement before

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.680
which is

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.960
Don't don't settle for having to access controls like that

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.880
And I got all kinds of well, we can't get developers to do that

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:09.320
Okay, if you if you're not collaborating with your development team if you're in a dedicated testing role and you're not collaborating with your dev team

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.480
That's the problem

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.880
Solve that problem. You'll solve all kinds of other things, too

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.120
so anyway, uh

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.640
We we support everyone if in fact I will put an open invitation out

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.960
If someone wants to come what else wants to come on the show and tell and tell me why?

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.280
uh

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.640
Why selenium is so much more awesome than test cafe?

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.620
We could do that too and I will offer that to you julian as free competitive analysis

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.800
I'll tell you I'll tell you if you if you want to do that

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.840
that's somebody on and uh have me be there as well and

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:53.080
You know have a big discussion about this versus why and i'm gonna even go more meta on this and say

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.040
uh

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.400
Don't use a tool because it's the one everyone else is using don't follow someone

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.880
Because that's the guy you think you want to follow form your own opinions

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.480
Whether it's around philosophy approach quality

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:17.400
Test automation tools do your research and form your own opinions. I can tell you i've formed mine and mine is that

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.720
uh test cafe is very easy to use and

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.320
Consistently runs my tests across every browser. I could throw at it

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.240
It does seem to me that intellectual laziness and

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:35.400
In the knowledge work business is a great way to limit your career

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.120
Um one million percent. Yes

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.760
The and then for those listeners who are curious

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.760
Alan's uh ui rant was episode 102

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.280
And the follow-up 103 was the one with

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.760
Jason

00:43:54.920 --> 00:44:01.160
I I will look up those and um, um listen to them afterwards. I just like to say, um

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.700
I had a thought and it's gone. Um, it sounded like me

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.100
No, it's completely gone

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.980
Actually, I was looking at um angry weasel ab testing the website and um

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:25.100
You are responsive or the site is responsive. So it's a word. It's just a wordpress site. Yeah

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.340
Actually, I should bring this up

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:35.180
I used to give a workshop at conferences called tools you can use a bunch of different tools that any tester could use for testing

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:40.780
And I use test cafe as part of that i've since open sourced that I know one of our listeners chris kentz has

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:46.460
Given that workshop and anyone can but I used a quick little test cafe script

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.340
uh to do some automation of angry weasel.com and

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.210
And show that as a demo like this is this is how easy it is. It was not very much code

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:58.810
Yeah

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.370
The I I just remembered what I was talking about. Um

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.570
You were saying about, um developers

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.680
um

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.680
not being um

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:16.360
Exploratory enough if you like and just plumping for whatever everybody else is using

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.960
Um, this is something that we we come across with regard to our trial versions

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.200
Essentially the trial versions of our products are there so you can

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:33.800
Play around with them and see if they're actually going to suit your particular application your particular company and uh

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.320
Whether you should actually buy them and all the rest of it and I always say to developers when they're

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.800
When they're saying well, you know, why why should I buy yours and not?

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.700
Um, you know competitive be your competency

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.440
And I just say to be honest, you know writing user interface controls

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:57.400
You have two audiences you have the user and you have the developer

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.080
and

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.540
So play around with it use it as a developer

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:09.560
And show it to your users and see if they like it and the same thing with test cafe

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.720
essentially

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.720
Try it use it

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.260
You know do a

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:23.740
Contest if you like between selenium or cypress or one of the other big ones

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.620
Uh versus test cafe

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:33.340
How easy is it to use? Does it suit your particular application? Does it suit suit your particular?

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.700
environment

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.740
And

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.620
Go from there if you plump for one brilliant

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.420
I'm not going to argue with you if you say, you know, we did a test we checked, you know

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:51.420
You versus selenium versus cypress versus weber and we like selenium better

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.240
fine, brilliant you actually did the work to

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.000
say

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.960
that

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.560
Selenium was better and i'm not going to argue with that i'm not going to jump up and down and say well we use javascript

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.080
We use javascript

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.160
You know, you know, it's it's nothing nothing to do with that. I

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.440
Goes back to that whole, you know writing crappy code or whatever or writing

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.480
Code which you look at and go. Holy cow. Is there any way to make that simpler?

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:28.080
Uh, maybe if I switch my framework, it would be simpler to write and to maintain and to use and all that kind of stuff

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.720
but at that point it's

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.240
you and

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.240
your developer mindset

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.680
Whichever thing works best for you go for it

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.840
Yeah, same same advice for me

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.120
Yes, brandt. Sorry. Yeah, this is to julian

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.880
Julian has so are you familiar with the work of nicole forstman?

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.350
She recently published a book called accelerate

00:47:56.270 --> 00:48:02.990
I just like to point out now for our listeners. This is the 37th podcast in a row. We've mentioned the book accelerate

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:05.550
Go on brandt. Yeah, we we

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:10.800
Um, so what she did is she went back and did

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.360
A research study around sort of typical agile practices

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.920
and

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.920
she concluded

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.600
many interesting things

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.220
um

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.380
one of them was that

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.640
Uh developers owning their testing

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.320
Owning the testing for a company was highly correlated with

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:40.650
Uh the company's success and productivity

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:43.850
uh, however

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.330
qa owning

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:48.410
the the tests

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.730
uh was not at all correlated with

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.350
highly valuable business results

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.890
and um

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:04.570
This is somewhat towards the salimian salimian comment and perhaps test cafe

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:08.810
But I wonder if if companies in your sorts of business

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.760
Shouldn't in some regards help your your customers?

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.700
um

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.140
I need those sort of goals. Uh, meaning

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.260
Right. Sure. If you don't have an id

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:32.140
Uh, if you don't have ids we're gonna fall back and we'll still succeed within test cafe

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:34.620
But now you're gonna have the high maintenance

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.180
Uh version of your recorded test rate. Um

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:47.840
I'm wondering if things like annoying warnings or or or something along those lines to sort of

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.680
Start changing the their engineering behavior towards

00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:01.320
towards things that are that are known to produce positive business outcomes like it seems to me

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.150
Uh if test cafe was able to say

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:12.120
Hey, we not only just do tests, but we actually help you change

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.800
Uh the culture of your business

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.900
Right. We're an ally to your business as well as our own

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.790
anyway

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:29.710
That's an interesting viewpoint and i'll have a chat with the developers. We already produce a

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.950
Uh a product for c-sharp developers and javascript developers

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.830
called code rush which

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:42.030
Helps you analyze your code and suggest ways of improving your code

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:44.830
like it already

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:46.350
and

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:51.230
That seems to be or what you're saying there brent seems to be something that we could

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:54.110
do with test cafe whereby

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.790
as a

00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:02.510
An example like the stupid example I gave earlier, you know instead of hey, you're selecting the 13th child of this parent

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:04.860
Why don't you give it a name?

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:11.180
And here's a name for you or something like that. Let me that's an interesting viewpoint

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:17.980
And I I've just bought it on amazon and it's coming tomorrow. So there you go. It's a great book

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:23.420
Um, okay, that was my turn to forget what I was going to say as a photo

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.420
Yeah, it's the end of the week

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.860
Mind you every day seems to be the end of the week

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.460
Oh, yeah. No, my my recurring comment there is every day is tuesday

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:43.770
Right. It's not monday. It's like the not the typical misery of monday. It's it's not oh wend's day

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.130
Hey, we're halfway through it is most certainly not friday

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:54.830
All right with with that I with us all being confused by the day of the week

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.030
but not being confused on uh

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:01.870
branch shut up

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:08.670
But not being confused on having a great and fun time talking to julian today

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:11.260
Uh, we need to close

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:18.540
Well, thank you very much. Alan and brent for invite me on to the uh, the podcast. I I must say I enjoyed it very much

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:25.500
We're super glad to have you here. And I uh, I say again if you uh invite somebody who wants to have a discussion

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.420
A versus b then I'll certainly come back

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.220
Yeah, sure. Let us know. Let us know. All right. Great. How do you hear?

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.740
Brent what were you saying? I said hear that hugs

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.780
We'll see if one of the listeners uh routes it to a

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.580
Yeah, we'll see what happens and again

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.620
I think it's I think again. I just want to close and say

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.220
critical thinking blind faith in anything

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.060
is

00:52:54.060 --> 00:53:01.340
Whether it's ideology or tools or anything in between is going to get you in a heap mess of trouble

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.340
so

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.180
with that message, uh

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.820
Thanks again. Julian good talking with you brent

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.060
And we'll talk to

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.220
You too and our other three listeners sometime soon. Everyone say goodbye

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:17.200
Bye, bud
