00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.340
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show we're back hey right how's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.490
it going?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:42.410
How you been? Overworked under exciting yes I did a big presentation to Scott Guthrie

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:52.430
I've heard of that man since we last talked and he is now referring

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.190
other teams to me by name I'm not certain if it's good or bad that Scott

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.190
Guthrie knows my name. Brent a mover and a shaker on his way up. I'm definitely

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.350
moving and shaking things but now I've got teams coming to me at a at a rate

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:20.920
around three teams per employee on my team so I have a I have a scale problem

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:31.580
coming very quickly. Well the trick to that is just say no Nancy Reagan. I was

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:41.130
just gonna say no. You don't like the Nancy Reagan add-on? No I don't. So anyway

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.440
so it's exciting times I will figure out a way to scale don't know how yet but I

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.830
have confidence that my background thinker processor will some at some

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.670
moment at 3 a.m. over the next week will wake me up and go this is the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.850
answer and I'll go oh thank you background processor I will execute that

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.120
immediately how about you you've been traveling I did a quick trip to Montreal

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.140
I left on Sunday came back Wednesday night got up early for my Thursday

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.020
morning meeting luckily got lots of sleep last night so yeah yeah a little

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.800
quick trip to Montreal I'm home for two weeks then I am off to Sweden to wait

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:39.880
Norway Sweden we think Sweden I am I am less geographically challenged than most

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.240
Americans I'm just stupid so yeah I'm off to Sweden to give a talk on

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.610
reflections on modern testing so the point of that talk is a a brief little

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.210
intro to modern testing and then I want to share some stories from some people

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.050
that have done some modern testing like things in the world we'll talk about

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.650
what's next should be fun I will share slides once I complete them on our one

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.390
of the three dot slack comm so that's exciting I also recently if you're

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.050
listening to this and listen to our feed you go what the hell is this weird new

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.450
age jazz stuff and Alan just talking kicked off the intro episode of the ABT

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.250
three-for-three podcast which is a will be a sporadic but interesting and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.210
shorter version of a testing because there's no Brent there's just Alan

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.610
talking to members of the three members of the community I have one show ready

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.930
to post probably go out next week I have another one recorded just needs some

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.490
editing and a few others lined up to record so those should be fun they're

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.730
all about 20 minutes long just a brief little peek into a slice of life and

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.610
people doing things that are modern testing like you have one released I

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:04.680
just the intro you release the okay so that's coming up and that's it that's my

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.320
travel for the end of the year and then I'm going to London for like eight days

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.110
in eight or nine days in January cool and that's as far ahead as I can think

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:23.320
so that's what's going on with me where I haven't turned around where are we

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.200
starting on today's podcast journey I would start you want to start with the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.780
letter or do you want to start with oh it might go into that so let me give some

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.020
context here yeah it's not really a letter I guess it's I thinking mailbag

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.280
but it's not a mailbag it was a slack message and I need to give some

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.660
context all of our mailbags are slack messages oh you're right you're right

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.300
this is the different one so this is gonna take a while to work into you

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.380
correct me where I veer off course or I'm wrong so most of you know I work at

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.100
Unity I recently six months ago changed jobs away from being a director of QA I

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.380
became that ever tell you my title it's stupid I wanted to be director of

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.620
delivery so back that's what I do I make sure that we can deliver and the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.060
way I describe it without saying accelerate the achievement of quality

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.580
because I say I help our organization about growing 200 plus engineers how to

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.340
balance quality and frequent releases and shipping faster how can we go faster

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.060
and with higher quality because those things balance each other out I think I

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.060
might have mentioned that on the podcast before I'll take a shot at tequila right

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.120
now hold on okay I'm back and that's what I do in the art my title is

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:50.460
director of program management which has a which is hard for me because at

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.700
Microsoft where I spent a big chunk of my life the program manager role is such

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.620
a bastardized bit of the remainder that's different from org to org and is

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.580
actually nothing like the program management I do now that it hurts a

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.700
little bit but I'm getting it I'm getting I'm getting past it are you

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:17.470
managing a program I'm managing all of our programs okay it seems like a

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.510
relevant title it's much more when I actually read books it's funny how often

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.110
you like do internet circuits on program management and you end up with project

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.630
management either a name or a description but what I've done some reading and

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.870
research on program management it's actually it's actually what I do I make

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.670
sure all of our programs execute it's very highly related to quality and

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:47.390
actually my full title is director of program management and quality so I

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.470
still have that keyword in there but anyway I still like director of delivery

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.390
they drive much better what I do but they wouldn't they wouldn't make up a

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:02.020
new title for me so a lot of syllables for essentially a release p.m. oh but it's

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.620
but it's much more than that we'll get to that later how does ship room go at

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:13.180
unity oh we don't have a ship why would how could you have a ship room I'm not

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:21.340
redoing the the old-school and actually versus new no but actually the

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.020
editor engine team does has something kind of like a ship room but when we're

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.080
shipping we have stuff shipping I mean we have 90 services that make up

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.320
monetization alone and those are shipping all the time yeah that's

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:45.590
actually an interesting criteria right in the old days just the existence of a

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:52.120
ship room was necessary because you need to get everyone together because the

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:59.780
decision to ship was a unanimous decision and also irreversible decision it

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.340
wasn't it was I mean for all intents and purposes yes it was irreversible it

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:14.780
would be extremely expensive and and as someone who holds accountability for

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:22.480
allowing a recall class bug to go out yeah I'm very sensitive to those type of

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:30.600
things I do think on as an aside shipping a recall class bug it's

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:38.230
something you have no choice to do but once but is a super valuable learning

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.430
lesson so here's an interesting stage where we're at I want to and we'll get to

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.510
a point here eventually we have we're talking about the SRE team earlier

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:52.430
before we started recording at Unity and we have incidents errors in

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:58.790
production something goes wrong we've had a few that were just oops bad code but

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:04.470
those really they happen but they're super rare right now what we have is the

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.950
flavor of error of oh wow it's actually I'll put it this way we have our errors

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:15.900
of complexity and what I call complexity or complexity due to integration

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.300
complexity dude like I make a change in this thing and then this unexpected

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:27.060
thing downstream does something unexpected based on that yeah so that

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.140
error of complexity we have a lot of those and we'll work on getting more

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.980
resilient towards those we have some errors because a third-party provider our

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.520
cloud platform for example may have an issue okay there's this course or stuff

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.080
with failover you can do there that would help their longer term and then

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.920
there are we had an interesting issue I don't know if I can go into it too

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.080
much but I'll put it this I can this way we had an interesting error took

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.400
us a while to track down we had one of our metrics was what we expected for

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.840
something we were we had rolled out to a small percentage of our of our users

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.880
and the metrics were off the monitoring like this something's weird here off as

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.160
in going in the wrong direction wrong direction wrong direction this something

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.320
it we had something we expected to be at a level when we rolled out to assert

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:30.230
to 10% and it was not at that level and it was well below it was not horrible but

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.670
there was something going on and we dug and we dug like we looked at our

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:41.260
community re-reviewed code undoing the change completely would not have been a

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:48.220
valid case because it was Jesus so hard to talk abstractly about anyway we

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.420
couldn't believe me we couldn't just undo the change we needed to figure out

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.620
why the change we made was causing problems lots of reviews of three etc etc

00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:01.020
we found out that it was just a malicious player running some scripts

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:09.250
okay so your system wasn't flawed in any way or did well change the system was

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:18.410
flawed in that it was no no no there's something they didn't get anything but

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.360
the fact that they were trying caused our numbers to go off so it's that

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.400
anomaly detection which is as you know as a data scientist is a kind of a hard

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.510
thing no anomaly detection is not hard not all really yeah root causing the

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:44.230
source okay that's hard okay fair enough so anyway my role oh so getting

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:50.030
back on track as some of the three know I send a newsletter ease to my used to

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.630
be my team then it was my former team and then eventually I just called the

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.950
unit eventually turned to something we call the unity quality newsletter and I

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.950
send it to a whole bunch of people at unity and various people sign up

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:08.390
including my manager current current manus per at both okay so lots of

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.110
people read this thing I just sent one out interestingly about accelerate

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:18.870
okay and kind of going into the book the BS of the word okay just the word the

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:24.750
letter a is beautiful good it's also a stand for Alan not coincidentally stands

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:34.220
for shut the crap up so anyway I got a message from my boss I got your

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.110
newsletter great mail and then he said I have another idea for you for your

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.270
next news like great now he's giving me I'm paraphrasing this brunch actually

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:49.430
read the quote but I'm paraphrasing the the text he's a very eloquent speaker and

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:56.270
writer but and I hope it's this podcast but wait you said you hope he doesn't

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:02.790
okay I have nothing bad to say about it actually I don't and as you know I've

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:08.140
hated a lot of managers yeah well mostly my last one at Microsoft but

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.290
it's others is to you know you I will throw any names under the bus I thought

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:20.340
Chris I liked Chris the next box he was good anyway all right then so and this

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:27.780
ties into my program manager and quality role and everything else I do he says

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:34.380
blah blah blah imagine a quality imagine as a quality leader as you are as mean

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.540
of our maneuver lessons are if you got control of the program management

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:46.690
aspect of the organization which I have and made some changes Halloween I was

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.730
trying to what changes would you make and how would they be measured and

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:56.090
measured stuff but what changes would you make and how would they be measured

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.420
and then there they says in your experience in this role what have you

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.900
learned about having that control of the activity of a product organization so

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.020
far and what matters but that first half I think is kind of interesting I'm

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.300
gonna throw to you and I'd love to throw to the listeners as well but as someone

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.420
with quality experience as a quality and testing specialist and rephrasing this in

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.580
the terms we use in modern testing if you're given a role where you're in

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.100
charge of program management of an organization we want to look at it from

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.700
a quality and testing specialist no I don't well care to do that okay as a

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:34.420
quality leader all right okay which is I think me as a testing specialist how

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:40.060
would you tell what would you do for PM yeah well I think it's important I

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.220
think a lot of people a lot of non-modern testers may approach this

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:52.020
challenge with a hammer I would have mandates and these things and I don't

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.100
think it's necessarily the right way to do it but I can give some context about

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.580
the org and the way we work as we go but I'm just going to throw this to you

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.260
I'll rephrase the question one more time so as a quality leader which you are

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.700
even though you're in data science so as a quality leader you're in charge of

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.540
program management for a large organization making sure all their

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.900
programs rumbling talk about what that means as needed what are some things you

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.160
do and how would you measure them or how would you measure success okay I was

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.240
kind of hoping you'd answer the second question do you want me to do that

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.740
first yeah I know actually I think that's better unless the answer is

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:33.100
nothing no the answer is not nothing so the second half is in so in my

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.260
experience what have I learned about having the control of that and so far of

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.780
what matters but I think that that's more of a follow-up to the discussion

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.140
from you I can talk about what I've done and what I haven't done because

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.700
there's you know how you are you're in a new role and you're figuring it out you

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.100
feel like yeah yeah I'm getting this I'm getting this I'm getting this and you

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.020
get to a point look back and go oh I could have done that stuff a lot better

00:15:54.020 --> 00:16:00.990
I'm kind of at that stage to do this longer would be easy the first thing the

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.910
first thing I would do is essentially start executing against a Reese style

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:13.860
playbook program management program management project management PM mate

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:22.420
their job is to help you grow the business by creating happy customers okay

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:28.180
sounds a lot like accelerate the achievement of shipable quality except

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:38.960
in my view the PM role should be at least if not more one milestone ahead of

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.000
the rest of the engineering team so I think you're confusing a little bit I

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.360
mean let's let's get our PM roles here that's a set context so we have product

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:56.600
managers who are and that's more like what our program manager roles were at

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.600
Microsoft a little bit more like the product owner so the project the

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.240
product manager they're the ones who talk to the customer figure out what we're

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:11.560
building establish the where a requirement doc or better stories that

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.400
define what the feature is what the things are we're building okay they

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.640
figure out they're the ones figuring out what's the hypothesis for the

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.600
experiments were running I change my view of this text and just put in

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:29.320
release manager well no because that's and I know you're yeah so when you're

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:36.600
talking about PM that so product managers do those sorts of things so my role is

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.720
there is some release management in there and I've done that role before

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.240
but it's a lot more risk management a lot of my role is making sure that

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:52.220
people are doing the right things to plan their work to make sure I mean we

00:17:52.220 --> 00:18:01.020
do p50 estimates which are surprisingly good I can go into those later I make

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:09.140
sure that 50% probability will hit the estimate on this date so take a chunk out

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.420
of hubroids how to measure anything book we're gonna try and estimate with a 50%

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.100
probability that will hit this date okay that's what we made by feet of p50

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.020
estimates so I'm making sure people are talking to each other making sure

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:27.980
coordination between teams is working as needed are like most teams when a

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.540
sub team needs to ship something they do it very well and their predictions are

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.820
very accurate and quality is high as features or functionality begins to span

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:46.790
multiple groups of teams is when more risk is introduced I'll say so I try and

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.710
make sure I can identify where those areas are get the right people talking

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:55.430
ask a lot of good questions I'm good at precision questioning or just asking

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.230
like what's the worst thing that could go wrong if you ship this tomorrow and

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.670
they freak out and create a whole big list of work items to go investigate

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.830
which is good so things like that so I'm really just trying to resolve

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:13.430
constantly trying to mitigate risk across the organization so that's my

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:20.810
role mitigate or prevent prevent if I can I'll take mitigate okay and the risk

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.650
you perceive is what it's primarily lack of communication the risk is complexity

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:30.530
or lack of understanding of complexity when you look at estimates estimates

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:37.150
really are just an evaluation of complexity so I try and make sure that

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:45.670
we have more context to evaluate that complexity so that we can make better

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:54.790
choices and or trade-offs or communicate downstream or etc etc so that's the

00:19:54.790 --> 00:20:00.790
difference in and that's fairly constant in what I've read in the books that I

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.550
found that have been about program management and the writing online about

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:12.120
program management versus product or project management okay so in the

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.400
context of the role you're talking about the decision around what to ship

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:25.020
what we're gonna start working on is already made your your role the way you

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:32.080
describe is now around reducing the risk and increasing predictability of the

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.360
delivery is that right sure part of it which is I think why it ties into

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:45.180
quality quite well if the outcome variables so in some regards like what you

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:53.030
describe you keep not care about quality at all right your job is someone

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:58.670
made a decision to ship this we're gonna ship this damn it no no no I never said

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.790
that no no so how does quality play into this what what what pivots do

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.710
you have in your role as a quality leader here or is that maybe the

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:14.550
question how do we introduce quality into this the answers to your question

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.710
are sort of endless I guess the reason for the trying to explain a little bit

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.950
what I do was to provide you context because in your answer to the question

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:27.790
you are falling into the traditional Microsoft definition of program management

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:33.160
which isn't program management no no no so I here's what I have in my head

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:41.760
right I think of a train station okay you're the you're the the guy that's

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.840
standing on outside of the train station with the stopwatch making sure the train

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:52.260
leaves on time but someone else has already decided what what the train

00:21:52.260 --> 00:22:02.210
schedule is what the destination no no no that that's not it at all so I'm

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:09.180
trying to map it I mean you're right there's a very different is there

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:16.460
actually maybe we should just go this way is there a role at Microsoft that is

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.300
directly is there a title at Microsoft that's directly to the thing that you're

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.700
talking about no okay so that we're gonna have to go to get on the more

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:32.060
complex so yeah so the product manager when does when does their jurisdiction

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:38.980
stop in your start that's a good way to ask that I would say that they're

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.700
defining what we build the engineering team and I'm part of engineering okay the

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:52.000
engineering team builds it I work a lot on how what about when when is up to the

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.560
engineering team so one thing I really like about our org is we have a mantra

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.480
or a statement only engineers can give dates so a product manager can say here's

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.320
what we want to build here's the stories and they'll say okay it'll be done by

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.560
June tober 15th I say oh no we need something sooner I say okay fine cut

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:18.710
scope more re-estimate otherwise June tober is alright so your job is to

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:28.460
address how I would say largely how yes how okay which is why your release

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:34.100
manager thing isn't too far off but typically that role is only effective

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:47.100
or only prominent later in the cycle do you do you have the ability to declare

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:55.770
we've made a decision and we are stopping this work no but I can and have

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:02.380
made recommendations along those lines which are generally followed okay all

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.780
right so I leave it I leave that decision to the product team I give them

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.580
the information so that I'm not I'm not a I'm not the guy with the stopwatch and

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.250
the whistle deciding when trains leave all right so when we talk about quality

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:25.100
are we are we talking about how would I now term code correctness no not at all

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:30.100
I don't I don't I only cover that if someone's really messed up and I really

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.700
have to okay so in terms of the role that you described to me it seems like

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:40.580
quality what you have the ability to influence is make sure as part of the

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:48.800
requirements a definition of quality is the is considered right telemetry

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:56.770
monitors you guys operate a service knowledge around I constantly think of the

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:01.650
pivot and persevere meetings that's in the the Reese's book yeah right your job

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:08.740
is going to be to make sure that post ship those questions and those meetings

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:23.700
are efficient effective and informed yes but part of if you control how and I

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:29.460
guess to some degree what then to me the the number one metric that matters is

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:39.210
going to be it's going to involve cycle time mm-hmm and I'm thinking something

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:49.000
along the lines of some ratio of errors to cycle time sure right it's because

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.320
you want to be able to a key part of your role is how do you iterate and

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:01.800
move faster yes but how do you do that without incidence I it's so funny that

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.800
after all that roundabout way like I didn't know where we were gonna go you

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:15.180
kind of ended up with the right answer anyway okay so cycle time is important

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.540
if we go back to I can remember who put it this way one of the three but I

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:24.300
bring it up all the time it's in fact I brought it up in a conversation

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.980
yesterday about a related subject it was a conversation about how we manage

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:34.420
programs and for context I wanted to manage my proposal was that we manage

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:41.800
feature or functionality or product work differently than we manage experiments

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.640
but well I make the experiments visible so anyway but I kept my role is to this

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.680
is stolen right from one of the three I wish I remember two but I give you full

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.720
credit pat yourself on the back if you're listening our goal is to reduce

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:03.600
the time from product hypothesis to customer feedback so that's the cycle

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.450
timer cycle time in Jason yeah going back to accelerate the look one of the

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.210
metrics they say is an indicator or a predictor of quality is deployment

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:23.770
frequency we reduce time from product hypothesis to customer feedback if you

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:33.000
yeah if you have a case your job oh this is this is not gonna get really

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.920
interesting so the KPI and our listeners are going thank God it's getting

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:49.000
interesting so the this is in your job is to measure and increase adaptability

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:57.490
yes I want to write that one down keep going because reduce time from product

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:08.460
hypothesis to customer feedback right first and foremost love it so it

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:19.250
basically says okay my stuff you know my I might even classify that now you know

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.850
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna specify an additional thing on that one

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:32.850
reduce time and waste from product hypothesis to customer feedback because

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:46.620
what I was I was thinking through is you want to reduce the cycle time your job

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:54.790
is to fail faster and faster yes yes that's the exact see very much the scope

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.870
of my conversation about experiments my argument was that I I met with one of

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:04.670
our data scientists are really got smart data scientists in Montreal and

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:09.770
we had a long conversation about how our experiments take too long why do they

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:17.130
lots of reasons I'm not good lots of reasons that are not fair for me to go

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:25.340
into on a public podcast we have we assume their unity technical IP reasons

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.940
in some cases yes it's also our data science team and monetization is fairly

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.660
new but anyway most of our experiments come from our data science team but I

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.340
want to use what they're doing and accelerating their ability to experiment

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.900
to build a culture of experimentation across the other teams as well so that's

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:48.740
all part of my master plan yeah so I'm heavily in a bunch of experiments of

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:55.140
course so right now right and the the team I'm interacting with we have not

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:02.460
implemented any sort of experimentation framework doing an experiment takes a

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:11.660
developer to hand code and hand separate the sample we have many of the

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:21.980
same issues and and even then once it rolls out you'll you'll very quickly

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:31.750
discover crap the two experiments aren't clean enough because they both share

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.790
this one variable that invalidates the experiment and then you have to do it all

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:45.030
over again yeah it's not it's it's not friction-free yeah I get that so yeah so

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.070
many of the same issues so not going into details yes there's many things that

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:53.230
can slow down your ability to experiment and fail fast so yes now now we're

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.230
getting somewhere this is I like it when conversations go this way we're

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:02.070
actually eventually reaching some agreement there's a time over cost that

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.980
is important in your role and I'm trying to figure out how to put that in

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:15.020
right you can fail faster and faster and faster right you let's say

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:22.340
presumably you could put a backlog of hypotheses that can all be independently

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:28.580
tested as experiments it's probably not true but let's let's assume okay but the

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:35.060
way you do that is it takes a thousand man-hours every day to pull it off

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:40.610
that's too expensive that's way expensive yes right and so it's it's it

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:46.250
needs to be easy to experiment it's the the price tag associated with

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:56.660
improvements in cycle times is something to take on does this flow I'm

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.740
trying to recall if low has a KPI here that you can it's interesting because I

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.660
was thinking about this I'm not obviously in Mike in Microsoft

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.580
recording this but right on my desk at home there's usually one book I'm

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.220
referring to on my desk in front of me and the one I pulled off the shelf

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.260
last night to think about this was flow it's on my desk better know I'm

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:23.580
gonna look it up yeah a lot of a lot of what he does is justify the principles

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:30.410
and and explains it with science why that's the principle right so obviously

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:35.970
smaller smaller chunks is one way you're gonna do this yes one hypothesis

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:44.740
at a time is a great way to build smaller and smaller chunks right the one

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:52.370
hypothesis at a time per feature right I would it would I would not be failing

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:58.790
fast enough if we were on one experiment at a time overall no the sequencing will

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:07.810
kill you yeah a lot of teams will do pairwise deployments as long as the the

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:15.940
features are mutually exclusive and don't mess or step on each other right

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:22.590
so there's an art and science to how do you how do you deploy these multiple

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:27.550
different experiments into one payload so that you can reduce calendar time on

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:32.900
this putting in feature flags and putting in the mechanism that track

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:41.580
because people today deal with DLL hell as well as version hell and then when

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:49.460
you add in flights that are making very real I took me a while dot feature the

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:57.300
DLL is that library thing on Windows it's really shitty right DLL have an

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:04.500
equivalent in every operating system it is a it is a versioned package whether you

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:13.100
get it from new git DLL Python package whatever I guarantee you guys have it and

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:25.600
it's a problem the yeah so let me go let me back up here and get and and I want

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.440
to get back towards I think we're on to something with the measurements and

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.120
some things I've been thinking about so as a quality leader and I think

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.880
quality leader we've thought of things like flow we've read accelerate we have

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.400
ideas on what it takes to get quality software to our customers and we know

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.850
it's not all testing that goes back to your functional correctness thing it's

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:53.270
how do we make sure we're delivering something valuable or something it's we

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:58.350
can get valuable feedback from that gives value to our customers and we had

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:07.240
mentioned error rate frequent to look at deployment frequency incidence divided by

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.760
deployment frequency we get an error rate that should decrease if quality is

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:17.900
going up and then a little bit about velocity no no I'm gonna push back on

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:25.290
that okay so I'm thinking about Reese okay so I think one of the mistakes that

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:30.730
a lot of people make in this case is that they they go back to what you

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:42.910
say they track error rate what you need is a positive metric to improve versus

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:48.470
one and I like is more powerful and the reason the reason I bring up error rate

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:54.950
errors per deployment is that's one of the predictors of quality that's listed

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:59.510
in accelerate so what would be the inverse of that what will be what

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:04.990
metric will be try to improve rather than do you remember the episode we

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:13.070
talked about where where I taught you my little hypothesis process yes very much

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:21.180
so it's completely ripped off and re-embodied in the principal five six

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:27.650
principal six forgot them all episode of the ministry of testing course which

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:37.110
is coming out next week anyway go on plug so Reese came here to Microsoft and I

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:43.430
managed to grab a seat when he came in and he talks about you grabbed his seat

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:50.670
no AC okay I have all right I would have maybe and I don't want to

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:55.110
summarize the whole first three well I do want to summarize the whole first three

00:36:55.110 --> 00:37:02.840
chapters so he worked on this he was talking about the initial when you when

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:08.160
you're in an entrepreneurial role which may not always be the case and in in the

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.900
topic that you're talking about when you're trying to break into a brand-new

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:20.470
market you think you have created something that is an innovation and he

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:30.820
always recommends first see if anyone cares yes right and he talked through an

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:41.060
alternative strategy to the critical failure that caused him to write lean

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:48.900
startup okay I'm not gonna summarize the book but I am gonna summarize the book

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:55.180
I'm just not gonna go into detail and then I'll and then I'll they they had a

00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:02.620
large number of people who worked 40 hour days for six months straight because

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:12.620
they had an idea and they were convinced it would have been awesome and the day

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:19.160
came to ship and they got 12 people to download the project that they and

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.480
several other people had killed themselves over the last six months to

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:31.670
deliver okay far from a solid ROI mm-hmm statement we've all yep that that's a

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:36.710
common story in software and so he spent time in and we've we talked about this

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:41.990
in retrospective episodes but he spent time thinking about what could I have

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:49.740
done differently to come to the same conclusion sooner yeah but this is

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:54.500
going back to the now let's talk about errors and failures let me let you

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.420
finish up and we're talking I think we're talking about two different things

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:02.700
but you may wrap it up and make some magic connection go I I will and you

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:10.150
realize what he could have done is created a website advertising his product

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:19.980
with a button that says click here to download in at the seminar he stated I

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:28.770
would have learned exactly the same thing but that would have been infinitely

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:34.010
cheaper to produce I just gave that same suggestion to someone last week

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.690
we're talking about a we're not sure which of these three or four features

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:40.970
we're going to add next to this component I said add buttons for all of

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:45.870
them and track who clicks what and then he said it in the seminar by the way

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:54.280
he asked the crowd would I have had to implement that download button or would

00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:05.020
a 404 been fine answer of course 404 would be fine right and so that's where

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.060
that's what triggered on the the error cases because in that case you would

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:13.940
have a sharp rise in 404 it's an ex I'm not talking about I mean it's expected

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:18.180
error it's an expected error so there's a huge difference overall we're using an

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:24.540
error to track product market fit and which is fine I'm talking about errors

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:32.350
that cause what we call an incident what some companies call an oops I don't know

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:37.150
it's something that causes people to go fix something in production Reese has no

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.710
intent of going to fix those 404s in that case there's there's no reason to

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:45.270
we just want to track the data it's a it's a cheap way what he's done the

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:52.560
404 is cheap telemetry you can track the 404 on the page request and that's

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.610
most most web servers will track that for you quite easily it's super smart

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:07.480
but what I'm talking about your he turned an error code into a value code so

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:13.200
looping this back into my original statement okay is that yes they're

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.640
going to there could be caveats depending on things that are

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.920
experiments or information gathering or trying to evaluate product market fit

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:29.800
versus actual errors that impact customer success now so now and my

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:36.180
original question was how do you turn that metric of errors per deployment and

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.660
these are errors as I described a moment ago into something that can be

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:46.180
measured as a positive thing you want to improve I or maybe we don't maybe

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.740
maybe I just push back and say actually counting errors per deployment and

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:54.100
reducing that is something we do want to improve errors per deployment is a

00:41:54.100 --> 00:42:00.740
vanity metric you know that I do know it I know it's totally gameable but I

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.780
do know and trust the research by Forsgren et al and accelerate that

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:09.100
says it it along with their other four key metrics they came up with our

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:14.900
predictors of quality and I think they could be it's tough I forget what they're

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.460
called you can tell me what they're called when they measure they find that

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:23.900
all these things are indicative of high quality and services but correlates but

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.020
but the moment you begin measuring them they become less valuable what's that

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:36.980
called that's Hawthorne's effect it really is it's Hawthorne's effect

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:41.740
because the second you the people's behavior changes in accordance to how

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.900
they're being measured okay so let's and anytime you measure those error

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:52.500
rates it eventually comes down to who's accountable to reducing them so let's go

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.860
back to once again to the original question so as a quality leader what are

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.140
some things what I don't know about changes as tough you don't have the

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.420
context but what sorts of things would you measure to know that your program

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:12.660
effectiveness of my program I mean your ability to get if we go back to I forget

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.700
the quote but our ability to get feedback get value to our customers and

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.660
get feedback from them what are some other things that you would measure to

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:30.940
know if that was being effective or something that would be less gameable

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:35.010
you could track against and watch improve so here's something that's

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:44.420
actually the way you've now framed the question is extremely relevant I have

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:51.820
been asked to solve that problem for Azure Azure compute specifically great we

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:58.180
have the same job we just figured that out we don't have this I'm gonna do it

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:03.010
a fun way you're gonna do it by cat hurting or vice versa we'll see what

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:08.410
happens here's another way of phrasing it so so I will say I have ideas on this

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:18.850
one as it relates to compute but here's how I will generalize it in the absence

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:35.660
of surveys how do you measure a particular type of error and its

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:46.580
individual impact to see set don't you measure it without sending surveys

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:57.860
don't surveys are revenue lost revenue lost is a negative metric but if you

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:10.010
revenue not lost no so I'll tell you have you heard of the CLB common

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:15.890
language verification no no customer lifetime oh oh we just call it ltv

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:26.900
lifetime value but okay sure makes sense my current my current thinking is that I

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:32.060
would expect to see if we're going in the right direction I would expect to

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:41.060
see CLB go up of course the problem is you need time to be able to see those

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:48.960
trends maybe yep and so you want to be able to you want to be able to say

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.240
actually I'm gonna go back to my experience and being we had the ability

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.360
in being because we had everything till we had everything hooked up we could

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:08.100
track changes to we could track changes to an individual check-in and because

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:17.780
every query generates ad revenue in that particular case it was very easy to

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:22.860
look and draw connections to Alan you're checking yesterday cost the

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:27.860
business one thousand two hundred and eighty four dollars and fifteen cents we

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:35.940
had that ability in big is because both the revenue side and the telemetry side

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:46.220
are near real-time okay our our ability to measure that is lagging that as is

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:58.590
mine support request is another heuristic what you trying to do yes so

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:03.480
okay you have no choice I've talked myself into it all right until you have a

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:11.100
near real-time signal that expresses a positive happy point and maybe it's

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:20.180
usage which is common in in an experiential stuff right like the website

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:27.150
we talked about then yeah you have to you have to do two things you have you

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.790
will have to measure error rate but then you have to have something else that

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:39.860
is running lagged behind that quantifies the importance of that error rate when

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:46.180
it first rolls out you're gonna have to treat ever ever every error rate has

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:52.940
equivalently important to some degree but then over time you're gonna have to

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:58.260
do a correlation and be able to determine which errors are actually more important

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:06.020
than others yes going out of time here and I apologize I'll I will try and

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.140
fix this in editing as I always do but over the course of the podcast

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.740
Brent has moved himself farther and farther and farther away from the

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:18.220
microphone he actually moved the microphone closer to his body and then

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:26.220
slumped way back so he's I'll fix it as I always do but I would push back and

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:31.940
say I there have to be and there must be and there are things that I could

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:39.100
measure without that that's obviously a very good measure to without having real

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:49.300
time feedback on the cost of every change your job is to reduce the time

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:55.180
between product hypotheses and customer feedback you need both elements of

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.620
customer feedback because what you're trying to grow have you heard of NPS

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:06.050
what what is Microsoft call NPS no it's not Microsoft F you it's the world all

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:11.100
right NPS is net promoter score yes I have heard of net promoter score okay

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:18.340
you're trying to find that and that one is the world you were trying to find a

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:24.970
telemetric version of net promoter score right if you just track error rates

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:33.000
then you you aren't going to be able to accurately measure the net benefit yes

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.560
error rates went up but that's because this thing is super popular yeah and the

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.520
people who love what yeah once again we're talking about different things so

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:50.140
error rates are in I know you're talking about and oh my god and I don't

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.460
know what to do with it just I think tire put you in a straight jacket and

00:49:54.460 --> 00:50:02.990
just put your headset on you so we have error rate of course for 404s for

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:05.910
example all the different things for what I'm talking about for errors to

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.510
deployment because yeah you can have like an intermittent error that you get a

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.630
million users on you know more a bunch more hits on doesn't mean quality went

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:15.350
down quality actually went up because you have more usage and people are using

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:20.030
your application I'm talking about things that cause errors at the level

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:25.590
they cause what you could call an outage or an incident or something that

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:31.590
requires intervention something that may require something that may cause either a

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:37.190
inability to move forward or in worst case a revenue loss that level of error

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:44.900
per deployment is what I want to reduce oh okay so I'm sent turns out I'm already

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:53.900
central to that for core compute I don't if the question is how would you

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.780
change the program manager role essentially to reduce outages that's one

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:04.060
part of it emmer out of time okay but I I think we need to continue this

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:13.900
discussion because I think we had a lot of miscommunication on definitions it took

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.820
a while to get on the same page and I think we got there and I think what I've

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.940
discovered is that in our roles we do a lot of the same things which I find

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:31.530
interesting from a oh my mr. hyperactive hands over here it just

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:39.690
accidentally shoved his microphone down his pants so from a modern testing

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:45.690
perspective it's cool that we are largely in the same place but I that is

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:50.490
interesting and from a program manager perspective is just making sure people

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:53.010
are doing really it's making sure people are doing the right things you

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:57.530
may have been in the test architect group 15 years ago when I described my

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:06.770
role as I stop people from being stupid and well that's well I phrase it

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:11.490
differently now but it's like it's my more mature result is I try and help

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:18.590
people make good choices so it's a parental role sure all right I gotta go

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:24.270
okay you gotta go we're gonna talk more about this next time I'm well I'm

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:31.480
definitely I'm definitely not Brent and I am okay
