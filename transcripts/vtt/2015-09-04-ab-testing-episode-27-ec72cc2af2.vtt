WEBVTT

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.890
Hey, I am charming. I charming. I'm mr. Hilarious. You're not mr. Hilarious. Just hilarious. Yeah. Yeah, sorry

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.290
Yeah, all right

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.290
Screw that up already. Thank you. You want us as go for your?

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.030
Labels for us. We had a conversation we talked about you want us

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.130
Cast talk last podcast. Yeah, and we had a little Twitter exchange afterwards

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.130
She insisted we were charming and hilarious. We insisted she was wrong

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.810
In fact, she is wrong because in this room she cannot argue with us anymore. So correct. All right, so I'm actually

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.040
Not Brent and I am not Alan. I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.680
Always want to say stuff and see what Brent does. Hey, this is episode 27 of a be testing welcome everyone and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.800
27 I don't it's a it's a nice number

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160
Sure cube divides by three. Yeah, that might even be three squared

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.740
Don't you don't you have like a math degree?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.060
Gonna sip some coffee. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I gotta think what's new. What's new with you anything?

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.500
Anything cool? I'm saying going on. Hey, I just came back from vacation. Where'd you vacate to? I took two weeks off

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.350
first week I spent

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.470
Finishing off a sentiment analysis project for my school. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I know I know it sounds boring

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.470
No, I like really cool

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.430
It's a lot more work than than I ever expected to just get to 85 percent accuracy

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.550
And then I spent the next week at Walt Disney World

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.970
Those who are around or near Florida during last week

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.750
one of the one of the exciting things was it's hurricane season and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.390
Erica spent a good portion of the week threatening to let us not go home. Oh

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.550
So every day I was calling the airlines. Hey, have you canceled what's going on?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.670
And it turns out up until

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.090
literally 8 p.m. That day

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.070
Everything was gorgeous except it's freaking humid in Florida. I'm never moving there. All right. Good to know. Yeah

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.950
I'm sure actually people in Florida would be happy to hear that. Yeah, yeah, they're lucky

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.370
Anyway, yeah, it was it was good times. Very cool. Very cool. Should we dive right in?

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.070
One thing no, not yet. We talked about her

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.150
Presentation where we got the charming and hilarious. I wouldn't re-reviewed it after our bar

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.390
And you didn't like it didn't like it. Oh, it was fantastic

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
That's

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.190
Thing was gonna go off in the wrong direction. They're one of her slides where she talks about the mysterious customer

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.150
like

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
That cracked me up. I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.190
I didn't see the recorded talk. So I haven't seen her president. I think I got the slides

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.670
I walked through I think it's finally been posted with they kind of post things in order

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.010
I haven't chance to go through everything. I've only watched a couple talks, but I believe it's posted now

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.170
I think I saw a tweet about that. I absolutely think it's it's a worthwhile

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.810
I'll see if I can dig up a link and put it in the the elaborate show notes. I post every every episode

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.130
That was sarcasm for those of you that just download the episode never read the show notes

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.050
There's like two sentences there in this episode Alan and Brent talk about nothing period and yeah

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.610
We're like the Seinfeld of test podcasts

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.130
Except we're not funny

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.480
That's absolutely true. All right. So one thing in

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.710
number 26 podcast 26

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:17.630
We were talking about cast and we've had all just a like a 30-second talk about context-driven testing the school and

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.160
Which I thought was plenty but Brent would like to talk about it some more so I'm not always a fair game talk about

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.080
Well, so dive in a little bit. I don't know. It's it's

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.600
Almost a mailbag item, right? We

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.400
All right now it is a mailbag item. All right, that's right

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.120
we had we had several folks who took that that 30-second blurb that we put in and

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.580
Wanted to get more information from us as to why we sort of felt that way. So are you

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.660
Let's get some of the that before someone

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.110
Just turns off the podcast and either yells at us or just ignores us

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.310
Are you?

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:11.840
Against the context-driven school. I am NOT against any of the schools that the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.000
Thing it so Alan in in his Twitter response said something and I don't think I could say it more succinctly

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.560
I just think it's redel. They had 140 characters

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.440
Yeah, I know

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.810
But I think the context-driven school of testing

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.170
Redundant I think it's just simply testing. I'll play devil's advocate because I've watched the growth and the the following of this school and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.290
So I'll play the other side of it and there is bad testing going out there. There is factory type testing happening

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.500
In the world today. I also call that bad testing or I mean, I think all

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.030
When I first read lessons learned in software testing

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.070
Which I I think the cut the school is out before them

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.750
But it was mentioned in that school quite mentioned in that book quite a bit

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.470
I thought well a lot of stuff like yeah, this is that comes book. That's the I call it the gang of four book

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.550
It's BOC

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.410
Pedicord can maybe just three of them BOC pedicord and caner. Okay

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.110
Lots of you know interesting ideas

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.110
I thought it was great that

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.070
you know, sometimes

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.730
There are things like I know I haven't read it like in ten years, but like

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.500
One page says do this next page says don't do this. I thought it was great

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.060
It's kind of a good thought of the funny way to bring up context like it depends

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.900
Both articles were about the context of when you do that why it's good and why it's bad. I think

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.980
if

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.100
testing weren't knowledge work if

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.200
testing were the same thing it's like you need to make sure that if software testing was

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.940
There are four red buttons and four green buttons on this thing. Make sure when you press each of them, they make a ding sound

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:04.800
You would not need context for that. But I think any knowledge work is context driven. I can't think of any sort of

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.710
whether it's

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.690
There's no context driven school of lawyers

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:17.450
But lawyers for the most part even like the most boring law job you can think of there's context to how you do that

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.850
You know you you know what I mean medicine, especially there's no context driven school of medicine

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.500
I'm trying to think of wait, I I started off on devil's advocate and then I and then I fell off the wagon

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.880
I'm sorry. No, I actually I

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.500
Think that's probably the best you could do on devil's advocate in this context

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.360
Years ago

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.120
Before I had gone back to school and significantly slowed down on on writing my blogs

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.120
I actually wrote a blog

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.080
Entitled test is a four-letter word. I remember that one. That was one of your first ones. I think first you've written one of the earlier

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.000
Yeah, you only written like ten. So I've written at least 15. All right, whatever. Anyway, go on

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.190
and

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.450
In there I was referring to I found that there's a link in that blog

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.530
towards a old slide deck that

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:16.320
from pedicord who talks about the the four schools and

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.340
After our last podcast I brought it up because I wanted to remind myself of the of the context

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.010
Or the content rather in the first slide like bothers me immensely

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:36.460
He just is Brett announcing the four schools. I think there's five now. I don't recall with the fifth the agile school

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.560
Which I think you know

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.660
Yeah, and who wrote that I you know what I haven't followed the etymology know it like it was added

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.840
It could have been pedicord. I think and we'll get a lot of corrections from the the hardcore

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.640
indoctrination of these schools, but

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.020
again, I think it's very similar overlaps a lot with the

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:08.280
The context or in fact, I would anyway, there's an agile school's fifth one and there's a sixth one also

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.120
Wonder if Lisa or Elizabeth have the sixth the sixth one I'm introducing today

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.720
I'm gonna get the cat out of the bag is the Allen and Brent school of testing. I

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.010
Think we should come up with a the a B testing school

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:29.250
That may imply actual a B testing size worried about that one. We'll call it the BA testing. I'm back testing. I'm okay with that

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:35.970
But when you look at the slide deck, like the first first thing I notice is that it was published and presented

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.250
February

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.990
2003 well for the first time right? I mean, I'm gonna I'm gonna try and stay on the devil's advocate side

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.090
I'm just it was I don't know when lessons learned came out. I guess it was right about then

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.890
Maybe it was 2004. Maybe it was three that it came out. So actually that maybe they overlapped a little bit

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.490
When did your book come out?

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.340
2008 2008 it is now

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.210
2015 I believe oh

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.730
Yes, let me check my calendar. Okay. Good job

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:11.140
And we we've talked about this on the podcast before and you've even blogged about it

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.920
Your the content of your book if you were to write that today

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.160
How much if you were to write second edition?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.920
I know that but that book is very there are but there are timeless books

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.960
There are books from longer ago that I still find very relevant. So that's so I don't want to harp now playing devil's advocate

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.960
Or do you actually think that that's relevant in this context? Um

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.710
It's slightly relevant. I think what's happened. What's happened over the years is the other schools which are factory analytic

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.070
What's the other one?

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.470
You know

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.590
They've become even less quality assurance. Oh, yeah

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.160
Analytics, I think I wonder if it's in context

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.460
Is I think those schools have become the schools have become less relevant

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.480
In fact if I were to rewrite this and I'm not going to I'm not giving suggestions

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.480
And I'm sure someone will tell someone and cool and they'll yell at me about this

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.080
But if I were to rewrite if I were to look at this say I wrote this a bunch of years ago

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.580
Like I like I looked at my book. I thought well, this is irrelevant. You mean? Yeah

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.280
Let me finish my sentence

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.040
So I have talked about how I would rewrite my book if I could rewrite it today

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.460
Yep, if I had written this this slide deck

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:30.260
I think the way I think about it today is less about the four schools and they're just sort of a treatise on how

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:36.460
Testing because it's knowledge work needs to be context driven and because I think the other schools

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:44.260
They are I mean, I'm sure someone gave me examples of Joe podunked IT shop in

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.740
Saskatchewan

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.500
Absolutely is the factory school for these reasons and that's great

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:56.180
But they probably don't make software that people like or use very often. I think anything you're I think

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:03.900
Good even not even great, but all good software testing is absolutely context driven. So so the idea of

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:12.030
Indoctionating a school around it. It doesn't bother me because like okay, whatever the bet it seems

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.770
Like it's like whatever to me. It's like it's the same same for me, right? It's

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.840
What they're I must by the way, I am a crappy devil's advocate

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:28.890
Don't hire me as a devil's advocate because I fall off the wagon to his I can't I can't I can't keep in my role

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.850
It depends on the context. Oh, you know what? Yeah, we should have separate

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.570
Test and dev Alan. Do you think you could devil's advocate that side or the opposite side?

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.770
the funny thing is is one of my

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.210
There's a I probably have half a dozen

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.370
Quotes I use often enough where I clean them as my own and I should number them some point

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.850
But one of them is the answer to any sufficiently complex question is it depends

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.370
And I don't know if I've been using that sentence for longer than the context of a school's been around or not

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.370
But I've been using it for a long long time

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.850
Yes, so it doesn't matter. Yes, and I

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.890
Want to suggest I mean Daniel pink is well known for drive and motivation

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.010
But the book biff previous to that I'm a big Dan pink fan

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.850
Wrote a book called uh crap now. I can't remember

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.130
No, no, don't look it up. It's gonna come back to me a whole new mind. Oh

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.840
Whole new mind which is about

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.840
Knowledge workers and how people who use the right side of the brain are gonna be the creativity as part of their work are going to rule

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.600
The world and it's it's not rocket surgery

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.680
It's not unique to testing that is context driven. We need to get out of that mindset

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.080
So yes test needs to be contact driven and we can't test

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:51.040
Software that people actually would like to use and want to use the same way. We test buttons on a widget. Okay done story over

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.650
Agree you had more you wanted to say so so just looking at the

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.160
at this deck like number one

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.360
This is old old old content. I would say it at

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:11.050
Today the only real value in the the context driven school is

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:19.500
For people who who need that to validate their identity. That's quite honestly it it gives people like to belong

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.180
Yes, so sure I belong, you know, I'm the context driven school. It's great

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:28.020
And I think there are people the one thing I liked about watching the cast talks

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:36.320
Is there some people that are really gut they wear their their their context driven school name patch proudly on their jacket every day

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.120
but what I noticed not the talks it was a lot of talks actually just from people like you want to just

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.550
just give a good talk and

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.710
They didn't dive into the doctrine of

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.030
CDT

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:57.910
They just talked about doing good testing work and then that's that's good. I think that's great

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.030
So agreed whatever if you need it for your identity, that's fine. I'm not I

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:08.460
Again, I have nothing against the context driven school. Maybe I have something against schools. I don't know it just

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.180
Probably I think we've we elaborated enough on that

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.060
Yeah, let me do the preemptive next sort of brings up the next podcast

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.430
Somebody at some point in the next week or so

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.430
Well, maybe even today if I get this out today

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:28.430
We'll post a link to an updated doc on the school say no, Alan. It's much different. We have an updated doc

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.870
It's not old it is in context and I'm gonna read it. I'm gonna go. Yeah, but my my stance is the same

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.580
So this is nice the updated. I'm great

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:42.060
Great. We took care of the problem of being old and and it really is still contextual today

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:47.220
And that's awesome, but my stance doesn't change. So thank you very much. Yep. Same here. All right

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:55.060
So there is our library still is redundant and it is likely only valuable for for people and their identities

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:01.340
There's our elaboration on CDT. You know, it's funny. Why is it CDT?

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.460
Context see the context driven testing. Oh, because I do I'm a con thesis in bios all over the place

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.870
I'm a context driven tester. Okay

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.380
Again, that's redundant

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:21.230
You know what Brent I'm a context driven driver me too I'm a context driven podcaster

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:29.790
That's not fair because what somebody's gonna say is in that one you use context driven to mean sucks

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220
All right

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:42.500
Took me it's it's almost 9 o'clock in the morning. Yeah takes France an extra half a second to catch on here

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.940
Yeah, but I don't know that I would dispute that

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.340
So hey I

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.460
Last night we're changing the topic here and I think you have you have a conference coming up, but I'm gonna start first

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:59.500
Go ahead. I'm gonna let you finish and now I'm not did you watch a totally random here? I watched the

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.340
The MTV music video awards on Sunday to check those out

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.020
Is this the thing where Kanye goes on his yeah forever long?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.420
It was yeah, that's the one yeah, so

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.540
You know, so I watched the whole thing. I haven't I haven't watched the whole video

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.260
I'm freaking old and I haven't watched the whole music video words in years

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.700
But it was it's funny you watch this two and a half hour award show and they give away like four awards

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.570
That was pretty funny

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.920
but uh, I

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:42.560
Forgot us to say about that. But oh, are you supportive of West in 2020? Um, you know, I don't think so. I

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.390
Want to hear his platform?

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.550
Yeah. All right. Anyway moving on

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.650
Last night I awesome, bro. I

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.430
Bought some plane tickets. Yeah, where you going and a hotel reservation?

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.110
Maastricht, Netherlands, I probably got the name wrong. It's like m a a

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.190
Strich D

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:10.780
You talked about that's about a hundred miles from but I know where it is now because it's about a hundred miles from Amsterdam

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.820
So I'm gonna fly into Amsterdam take a train up there and hopefully find my way around

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.920
You've been there before haven't you I've been to Amsterdam

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.920
That I've been to Copenhagen

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.160
Which is a different country but in that part of the world. I've been to I've been to a bunch of places in Europe

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.500
But this is my first time to Maastricht and what are you doing this time?

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.060
I'm giving a talk at a mobile. I'm giving a keynote at Euro stars mobile deep dive

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.900
So the zero star goes on from it's like all week

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.780
Monday through Thursday, then there's this

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:50.850
Mobile deep dive on Friday and I am going to talk about what I I think you guys all know that the team

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:56.810
That I recently left was the team that made is making or has made I don't know

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.730
I'm not keeping up with them, but we made Android apps work on Windows phone

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.650
So big challenge in mobile application development is compatibility. Mm-hmm

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:12.210
Especially if you go to Android you have all the different hardware and different OS's and and dependencies but iOS has many as well

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.170
and we had it kind of from the other end or building a we have all the Windows phones and

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:27.430
Trying to get we're doing app capacity other side trying to make all these Android apps run on Windows phone now

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.430
This this could that you guys worked on

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:38.210
That's only with the phones that that ship with the windows 10 that'll be on the new windows phones. Yeah. Yeah

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.480
Which I believe should be out by Christmas. I don't know I

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.520
Have to look at it, but I'll anyway it's funny

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:53.000
I'm looking almost daily because my fold phone is old and I want a new one in and you'll like it because I'm gonna dive

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.480
pretty deep into how we used telemetry and

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.600
Data analysis to sort of solve a lot of the app combat problems

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.800
So this is your first non test conference in a while and you're doing it. It's a test conference

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.200
Oh, is it so it's Eurostar is testing conference

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.040
I'm doing a mobile deep dive at the end and then that's in November, but I'm doing I

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.100
Mentioned last year something to walk through kind of my horizon here

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:23.100
Just for the hell of it because it's random and it's morning. I just my coffee just kicking in last spring

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.060
I ran a half marathon for the first time

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.380
I think I'd mention that but I'm doing another one

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.140
So last time my goal was to finish in two hours and it took me two hours and 45 seconds

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.140
I was pretty bummed about that

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.620
Didn't stop that water

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.260
Is the other way around I had to stop and pee

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:48.140
So seriously 45 seconds and I had no gas left to run at the end though. So I'm doing another one

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.080
I'm doing a do-over in in October

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:58.740
I'm gonna see if I can get that time under two hours. I think I'm on track but as we'll see how that goes

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.940
You're practicing right? What do you mean practicing?

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:12.030
Way back in the day I used to I used to run cross-country and we would art

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:18.540
When we trained like I would run 10 miles every day. I don't miss those days

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.500
I'm too. I'm really too old for that. So I all the training I don't really have a

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.770
I mean I run

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.290
I'm running I don't know 20 or 30 miles a week. I've been doing longer and longer runs

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.290
I can I can run 10 miles pretty comfortably

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:37.270
not at race pace, but my

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.380
for what it's worth my

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.060
My like five and six mile times are way lower than they were six months ago

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.220
So I think hopefully that translates into a what's your five mile time?

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.020
about

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.020
48 minutes 47 minutes

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:59.630
Best I ever did was under 35. Yeah. Well, you're younger than I was. Alright, anyway, so I'm doing that

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:05.710
But I did I felt way too long talking about that. I am I just gave Lee Kulp on an ab an abstract

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:11.030
Remember last year in the spring I mentioned I got a call I was going down to

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:17.350
Someone canceled and I went down to the better software conference in Las Vegas to fill in and give a talk on

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.870
Actually that a B testing

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.830
So it went it went well enough that that ended up being a

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.310
For me was surprisingly a great deck. I

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.810
You don't talk about the data science stuff all that often

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:40.050
So I made a false assumption that Alan has no clue what he's talking about and actually he does it

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.050
Was a good deck. I can fake it and you know what it went well get till you make it baby

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.090
I made it because I made it well enough that I'm going back to better software

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.090
They lost Vegas to give a half day tutorial on a B testing

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.820
fantastic

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.820
You should have seen the bread

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.100
Said everything I said before I take back

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.460
You don't know enough to talk about a B testing for a half for a half day

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.780
No, I and I do I suspect you do I suspect I'll figure it out. I'll

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.840
Know we'll play games. I don't know. I have time to think about it. So that's coming up

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.480
Lee's a very funny man. I think that's it. Um, and you have something coming up too, right?

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.360
Yeah at the end of the so I'm not going to present

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.760
But at the end of the

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.280
September I'm flying to New York, but they'll be my first time ever in New York. So I'm pretty excited about that

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:38.160
For the city so great the name to twice, right? Right. Yeah for the strata conference. Oh

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.250
Which is for those who aren't

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.920
In the world. It's a major big data and data science conference

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.120
I'm gonna be going there partly to always like to learn latest and greatest and I find

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.960
It's interesting the world

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.960
today when it comes to to data science

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
those folks working on

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.510
Hadoop yeah

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:14.270
Kind of pushing the the envelope so it's a great place to pick up new tricks and new ideas

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.390
But I'm primarily going there for recruiting. Oh

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.070
Which for it

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.070
so I've signed up for all the

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:32.310
Networking events and I that's what we need we actually the first time in like 15 years. I have business Carter cards ordered

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.270
You know, I haven't ordered business cards in a long time. I do have

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.350
Angry weasel business cards. I said, I don't know where they are

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.140
Holy cow off think about that. They were show you this

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.490
No, I I had I got like a thing for a free like

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.590
50 pack or hundred pack of business cards, but in design so I designed some angry weasel

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.630
Oh, is this like one of the deals up on cloud or yeah

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.350
I've had like three dollars for shipping. I got some it's fun to do

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.120
When did you use those never?

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.960
They're still in the box they could give one away. I was thinking like for your book tour or something

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.760
Oh speaking of which I went to

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.840
Right

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:23.300
If there's any of the three that's in New York and and you're gonna be in that neighborhood send me during that time

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.940
Love to meet you send me a message on Twitter. Let's see if we can connect. All right two things

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.320
I'm gonna do one if I ever get that cloud deal again

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.080
I'm getting a B testing business cards with hashtag one of the three. Yeah, two wait

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.880
You're not one of the three. No, if we count us as one of the three then we have like one

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:52.050
Coffee is working for me Alan. Apparently not for you charming hilarious and an idiot. All right

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.890
On Friday it was awesome Trey McRae shout out

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.210
Recruiter it right I shouldn't calmer it didn't invite me to recruit me

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.890
But I got to hang out with a bunch of people from riot games who make

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:13.730
League of Legends they invited me that little shindig down it in Seattle and they got to have some

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.330
Beer and food on them and hang out and talked to him for a while

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:23.210
Cool people who was fun. I was I was like socializing software people. I ended up talking to

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.640
some of their testers about

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.260
Or I guess there were testers there. We're talking about quality stuff

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.060
I didn't ask him what their title was there an online game. They have all the right

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.860
Processes in place and it was good to talk to them and why they call you over, you know, Trey's been

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.900
Apparently internet from I hear from his co-workers internet stalking me for some time now

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:54.300
So he it was gonna be in Seattle said I will meet this man. So he hung out. It's cool. That's nice guy

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.720
Anything else on the upcoming home front? I get to the last topic. Yeah, that's good. And then we'll get out of here

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.200
So I posted a tweet about this yesterday

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.360
And this is the rant portion of the because we screwed up and put the mailbag at the beginning

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.400
but the rant portion of the podcast is

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.280
I've ranted about this before

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.280
Not on the podcast. Can I do one bit of intro?

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.960
But because because it occurred to me when we were talking about the

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.990
the charming and hilarious

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:30.220
Topic. Mm-hmm, right the what we what we ended up in the episode 26 is talking about

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:38.620
In essence god damn it. We're sick and tired of testers playing the victim card. Yeah, and in it

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.010
And here's another example of the victim card. I saw it a lot

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.590
It came because I saw it a lot yesterday and it comes up that comes in spurts, but it's it's

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.290
consistent enough that I don't get it is a

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.900
lot of

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.860
The cool kids, I don't know consultants a lot of experienced testers, too

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:01.340
I don't actually I kind of know who some of the consultants are. I shouldn't blame them

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.300
I don't know who they all are. I don't look at bios that often on Twitter

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.940
But I see a lot of blogs and posts

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:14.820
About we could make better software if it weren't for the managers or we need to get managers to let us do our jobs

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.940
correctly or managers are stopping me from being you know a

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.220
Proper tester blah blah blah blah blah blah if I were to if I were to just pop out of the ether

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.900
With no other context and read this stuff. I go. Oh my god all

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:36.660
managers of software projects in the world are complete idiots and morons and I will and

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:45.140
Apparently entirely anti-test. Oh even though more than likely they hired the tester right and even better

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.620
they are they they focus their whole job around you know bean counting and

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.180
and absolutely no context and and

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.970
Guess what there are probably some managers like that. That's great and

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:06.450
All know most know some yeah, but

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.560
backing up a step

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.340
You know I've worked for good managers and bad managers

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.540
I've been really lucky to have some really great managers in my recent past, but I've had really bad ones as well and

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.590
Regardless

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:26.110
One thing I can tell you and if I think if you would talk to any of my managers for the last 10 or 15 years

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:32.230
Microsoft they would say they would agree with me when whether I've had good managers or bad managers

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.070
You know if one thing I said to my boss when I came here

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.950
Was this current team current team this? Thank you

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:45.590
I said I have a track record of making my managers better and

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.740
And we had a conversation about that news

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:56.380
Blob is great, but I've done that I I think I have helped every single one of my managers get better at their job

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.900
In multitudes of ways, I think it's really important think it's important

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.500
Sure, I can complain about them

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:09.660
But to be the victim and go I can't do it because my manager says my very first day at Microsoft

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.940
My very first week at Microsoft

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.460
I've told this story. I think it's in the book

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.380
I've told it before manager gave me a list of test cases and said you need to run these every day

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:25.300
I said well when do you need them automated by because I was gonna just they were very automatable test cases said oh

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:30.280
No, we don't have time to automate. You just need to run these every day and I could go to you know

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.020
The Twitter wasn't around them, but I go my managers

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.140
Management will let me automate and I could just kind of be the the cry baby and go do this thing

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.160
You know what?

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.200
I'm gonna automate him anyway because I know I can do this like in my spare time

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.080
So I had them automated by like Thursday and and they run in the background while I was doing other exploratory testing it worked out

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.660
fine, I

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.080
Don't know if I made that manager better that manager was

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.800
Probably my worst manager at Microsoft if I didn't realize after I had better managers

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.760
But there's a point when I think even if you have a bad manager

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.200
You don't need to be blocked by them or if you have a bad managers manager

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.420
You don't need to be blocked by them the one thing I know I've said before on this podcast is is I didn't make

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.880
This one up. I've heard it before if you have a bad manager and management chain

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.000
You know you can change your organization or you can change your organization

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:26.730
Meaning you can be an instigator of change in your organization and moving things in the right direction

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:34.290
Or you can get a new organization to work in but I'm so tired of the whining and complaining and it

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.730
What bothers me more is it is this is this anecdotal and this may not be true?

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:44.530
But it isn't always like the person in the org making the complaint. It's like some

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.290
person who's not even a

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.370
Employee at a software company, but works in software

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:56.890
Saying these things about management in general when they have no and they have no context

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:04.400
So well I've worked with or I've talked with and every time I see some logical fallacy bothers you the most every time

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.680
I've someone's really gone off on like really far out there with I call him on it

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.300
I say do you have an example of this you point me to know but I've heard of this or I've talked to someone

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.840
Who did this and it's like oh Jesus?

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:24.780
Form your own damn opinion that part of context forming your own opinion. Well, apparently they're part of the factory school. Oh

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.660
There's my problem

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.760
Anyway, that's kind of my rant for the day on I just stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:39.460
I know the three you guys don't do this, but tell your friends to stop too. So I am a manager

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:46.180
You are actually actually was funny just yesterday. I was telling one of my employees

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:53.260
He didn't understand why I made a certain decision like screwing him on his review. No, he actually got a fantastic

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.420
But he didn't understand one of my decisions

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.010
Where essentially

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.310
We had this huge

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:12.410
big data job that was taken and I stole resources from one of the big data jobs to

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:17.670
Feed it to this other one and that created a huge bottleneck on the thing I stole from

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:24.600
We had this big fire drill this other thing needed resources and I basically made a decision to damn the torpedoes

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.800
I don't care what happens to this thing. Yeah, it's gonna screw things up. But this other thing we got to get

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:35.550
Going and he's like man. That's really screwed us up. And I said, you know

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:41.470
Oftentimes I just want to remind you that I that I am a manager

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:48.550
And what that means is, you know, a lot of times we spend a lot of times talking about architecture and really cool

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.370
brainstorming and

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.890
Strategizing and building plans and doing really excellent work

00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:01.710
But just remember that every now and again, I am still a manager, which means there's a little bit of pointy-haired guy in me, too

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.580
But on the on the manager thing right that the one thing

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.090
Right. It's one thing to tell people

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.920
Quit friggin whining and take control of your own destiny

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.280
That's another thing is is

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.280
What they should be doing instead

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.960
Right a lot of these managers when they are not managers, but the employees like my oh my manager doesn't care about quality

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:33.440
The hell he doesn't there's not a single manager on the planet that has hired a tester that doesn't care about quality

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.130
It's about

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:37.810
risk or

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:42.190
Return on investment in your particular case your your first story, right?

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:47.910
And I do find it interesting that my first manager also is the worst manager I've had as this company

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.950
I think you know for context on there. I think especially back then not as much anymore

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:56.110
We've kind of flattened dorks, but their turnover was so high

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:01.230
I might because people were resting and getting out of here at that time early in our careers

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:06.510
The managers we worked for were very inexperienced not just as managers as employees

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:13.930
I know people that were became people managed to being at Microsoft like a year. Yeah, and and

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.880
We were back in those days

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.180
It still happens, but back in those days if you got into management

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.540
It was generally because you were awesome as an IC

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:32.600
Yeah, and it it takes a while for people to realize and it took us as a company a while to realize

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.960
Just because you're awesome as an engineer doesn't mean you're gonna be awesome at management

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.920
And that it's funny because I've seen that I'll sidetrack here, but I saw that come up

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.800
I forget who was tweeting about that or blogging about that just very recently, but

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.820
Is there should be a path for and we figured this out a while ago, but there should be a path for ICs

00:35:53.820 --> 00:36:00.460
It's not management. Yeah. Yeah anyway your story is and in it and there there is I mean nowadays

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.800
Yeah, I don't think it's true at all companies. I think a lot of people

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.560
I like a lot of companies your path your only path to growth is management

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.770
I think it's done that I think that's still true today, right? Anyway back to whatever to your manager

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.210
Right back back in those days

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.400
right

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.720
God MS test was still around

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:25.290
Recorded scripts

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:30.290
Were the dominant way people automated? Mm-hmm, right?

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.160
and it was very common for

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:41.480
Those things to suck the soul of your test team away from maintenance because no one

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.140
Testers the primary testers that we hired back in those days were were essentially

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:54.770
Knowledge workers and it was very common that they didn't understand how to code

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:02.080
Right. I remember multiple times walking through very high-level testers and introducing them to oop

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.200
right

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:11.920
So I think your manager just made a call on round his perception. Oh, absolutely of what it's gonna cost the other thing, too is

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.860
Testers

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.860
They always got to be conscious of what the right thing

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:26.400
Right. The biggest thing I find is that they're not thinking about the right thing as it relates to the business

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.940
They're thinking about the right thing in some sort of idealistic

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.720
point of view around a

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.650
Pure testing world a pure quality world like software should be bug-free

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.550
No, that's the quality. That's the quality assurance school, right?

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.710
Close your laptop. Yeah

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.150
one thing I'm gonna interrupt is

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.930
One thing I've done for I learned to do this about ten years ago

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:55.370
I do it a lot is wish I would earlier in my career is once someone makes a decision

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:00.630
You don't agree with you don't like or they're dumb and smart people make dumb decisions all the time, but often

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.460
What I've learned to do now is I think about there's a motivation behind that

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.340
Where does that where did that come from and absolutely?

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:14.160
I was looking at my manager, but his motivation is I need to have these my

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.840
Man, just probably beaten on me to make sure he's tests to run every day if he takes time to automate those

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.840
They're not gonna get run so we can't do that

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:27.040
So that's really easy for me to see today or it's gonna take too long to run and I I need these results

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.320
Yeah, because we have some fire. Yeah, but you see that all the time

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.160
It's like, you know your your employee says I can't you know, you cut that really screwed this up. You look motivation

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.180
Well, I don't think why would someone cut that and probably because well, this other thing obviously is more important

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.600
It's very critical. So

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:49.440
Anyway, I think anytime someone makes a decision that you don't like don't agree with you think is dumb

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:56.600
One really valuable exercise is to just take a moment to reflect and brainstorm in your head on

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:03.460
What motivated that decision or that action and then then that gives you different context to work with them on

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.400
Especially when you want to modify that behavior. I'll add color to that, right?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.640
Almost every manager whether to do it consciously or subconsciously when they're making decisions like their job is to make decisions

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.800
They're making decisions on a return on investment criteria. What's the value I'm gonna get out of this

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.800
What's it gonna cost me and

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:29.960
What is the window of opportunity where this value is useful and I would even modify that that part of the state

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.720
When I think of managers and leaders, I think leaders make decisions a manager can be a leader

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:39.470
Leader doesn't have to be a manager managers make decisions to it. Yes

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:45.670
But some managers who are better leaders are better at it and do it more often and make more

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.310
higher

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:55.350
Riskier or more impactful decisions. There are a manager can be and I've known managers who

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:01.390
Weren't great leaders. They're okay leaders, but they were really good people managers

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.510
They knew how to relate to their employees give them the right work

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.710
Make sure they were motivated make sure they had the skill and the will etc etc etc

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.670
Which I guess involve decision-making as well. Can you briefly because

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.350
We're not on the same page anymore. Can you briefly define manager and leader?

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.330
Manager who is someone who asked people reporting to them

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.090
in charge of

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.610
Responsible for their career as well as you know

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.400
work, etc, etc, etc. A leader is

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.320
Someone who does not who may or may not have people reporting to them. But the leader is

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.920
Does more coaching whether it's technical coaching or career coaching?

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.680
can make decisions can

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.840
So a manager who's a good people manager?

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.460
Can not be a leader. No, we can't be no

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.860
But the Venn diagram is that there is what I'm saying what I'm saying is it's possible

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:08.220
What I'm exploring a manager what I'm exploring people manager and still not be a leader and still not be yeah

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.940
Maybe not be much of a leader. Okay fair enough. All right

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.130
My my bar I give this speech quite a bit, right?

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.600
The biggest difference between a

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.040
manager and a leader

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.040
managers

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:31.540
Have people who report to them first and foremost leaders may or may not but managers do have people who report

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:39.610
Leaders though have people who follow them. There's a key difference between those two

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:48.940
My reports if I'm a manager my reports don't have to respect me they don't even have to

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.540
Follow my beliefs. They don't even have to believe in what I believe

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.020
but if I'm a manager, they do have to do what I say a

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.990
leader though

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:07.070
If you don't have people who follow you and a follow means they've made a decision

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.230
that

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:16.630
What you're saying is the right thing. It's goodness. It's the right path to go it

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:22.870
Will not only benefit whatever the goal we're trying to achieve but but benefit them directly

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.900
right

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.060
We talk here at Microsoft

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.460
We have this thing called the senior band and one of the most common speeches

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:39.960
I give people is that to get into the senior band you have to show signs of leadership and then I go into

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:45.300
As long as speech as the what is leadership and to get out of the senior band you have to show them that you've mastered it

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.460
And that you have the capability

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:53.340
To be an investor in the business. Yeah, and you remember many years ago

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:59.020
I designed and taught a course to testers on what it meant to be senior and talked about many of those things

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:05.860
Yeah, that that cracked open like you had a whole like testing personas thing that you did for a while

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.740
Yeah, I had all kind and oh man. I haven't thought about that

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:13.580
Yeah, it's a different world because the world has changed and I've recognized that the world has changed and not holding on to ideas

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.580
From the past. Yep

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:23.140
So on that on that pointed note. Yes. How about we bring 27 to a close? Yep

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:32.010
Alright, mr. Charming. Okay. I'm charming Alan. I'm hilarious Brent and we'll see you next time. Thank you
