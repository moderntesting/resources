WEBVTT

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.460
Good morning everybody.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.460
Hello.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.180
Hey, we are back for the Jack Bauer version of A-B testing.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.460
Jack Bauer, 24?

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.460
We're gonna do this for 24 hours?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.860
Episode 24.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.700
Oh, I get it.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.380
We're gonna do it for slightly less than one hour

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.180
because we're not as hip and cool

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.540
and as awesome as Jack Bauer.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.460
No, but I'm fairly certain we could do a 24 hour session.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.620
Not that I want to.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.620
No, the days of me staying up for 24 hours are all done.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.140
Why does Jack Bauer never sneak a catnap in there

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.580
or a bathroom break?

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.180
He's got 24 hours, man.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.020
He's pumped on adrenaline the entire day.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.620
He's a rock star.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.660
But you're up all night.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.060
Reminds me of a situation just last night.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.540
This doesn't work very well for the podcast,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.020
but let me show you a picture.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.540
Oh my God, don't show me that picture.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.380
No.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.220
Oh wait, there's a picture.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.480
So this is my younger son.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.440
He's fallen asleep at the computer desk

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.520
sitting in the chair.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.270
I have never seen him do this before.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390
And last night we signed up.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.550
We signed him up for the Khan Academy

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.750
introduction to a JavaScript program.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.430
All right, so I was gonna ask you.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.550
It's cranking out some code.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.550
Yeah, it's like, oh my God, I totally remember those days.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.550
Yeah, just code till you can't sleep.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.270
All right, dad walked out.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.110
Do we mean today?

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.110
Do we set our world record for the quickest time

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.990
to hit a tangent in a podcast?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.740
We've done it before the podcast has started,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.660
so I don't know.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.860
All right, we do our best.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.500
Hey, so do we introduce ourselves?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.980
I'm Brent.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.280
I'm not, because I'm Alan.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.260
And we're here for episode 24 as you figured out.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.900
And shall we get started with our list?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.020
Yeah, so have you done anything interesting?

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.820
Those last couple weeks?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.060
No, I sat around.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.420
Hey, I just, not just just, but just,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.620
just got back from Canada.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.460
I left on Sunday up to Vancouver, BC.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.860
Sat in a long line at the border,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.300
got to our hotel, took the whole family up.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.060
How was the border crossing though?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.900
It's not too bad.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.620
It was about 40 minutes going across,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.300
but it was the end of the weekend.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.260
Maybe 20 minutes coming back, not too bad.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.140
I haven't been to Canada in like 10 years.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.700
I like Vancouver.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.540
It's nice.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.420
We had Monday off.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.260
What did we do?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.180
We sat by the pool and did nothing, I think.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.620
I took a little bit of time to tweak some presentations

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.620
because on Tuesday, I gave a three and a half hour tutorial

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.220
covering a variety of topics

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.660
around building your testing toolbox.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.780
And then went out and had dinner with the fam.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.720
And then Wednesday was exhaust Alan day

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.640
and a keynote at 8.30 in the morning.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.120
Had to get there at 7.30 for a little sound check.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.480
That the keynote went really well.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.720
I had a good time.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.800
I think the points really resonated

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.200
and it hit a lot of the concerns or the gripes people had.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.160
Or it could just be that Canadian audiences

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.520
are just very, very polite.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.600
I'm not sure.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.200
They're known for being polite.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.460
Yeah, but it was a good time.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.600
I really enjoyed that talk.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.120
And then had a little bit of a rest

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.760
while I quickly tweaked my slides from my

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.440
inside the mind of the 21st century customer talk,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.960
which was really just a deep dive

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.080
into a couple of the things that I talked about

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.560
in the keynote in the afternoon.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.860
And weirdly and oddly and probably disturbingly,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.880
there were some people who went to all three of those talks.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.720
Like at some point I get sick of myself.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.560
I'm not sure why you would,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.640
I have people come up to me and say,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.920
hey, I'm sorry, I didn't,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.960
I really enjoyed your tutorial and keynote.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.080
I'm sorry, I didn't go to your other session.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.900
I said, if you would have went,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.160
everyone was there that I saw already twice.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.640
I was a little creeped out about, so that's cool.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.440
And then if that wasn't enough.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.160
I guess it's an important lesson to mix up your content.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.000
I suppose, I suppose.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.480
Yeah, something new to the people.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.600
Yeah, hindsight's 20-20.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.400
I had a little bit more time

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.200
and then I was part of the Lightning Strikes the Keynotes

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.760
where I gave a Lightning talk, five minutes,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.560
which I put together.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.960
Lightning talks started at 4.15.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.160
I have my slides completed at four o'clock

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.880
because I started them at 3.48.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.620
Made it quickly, made a top 10 list of-

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.220
You didn't publish your Lightning talk.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.580
No, because they were silly.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.440
I did, people tried to be, I had no offense to them.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.820
Some people were very serious in their,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.060
trying to get a real message across in five minutes.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.460
After having given a tutorial, a keynote,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.900
and a track session all within 24 hours,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.540
I decided that I would do something a little lighthearted,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.020
did a top 10 list of things I heard at Star

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.820
and just had some fun.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.260
Had some good things in there too.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.460
What was number one?

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.860
Number one, is test dead.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.960
Okay, what was number two?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.300
How far down we had to go to get to something

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.300
that we haven't heard before?

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.660
A lot of things we had heard before,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.980
but reiterated some of the talks I had seen,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.500
some of the conversations I had seen,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.180
plus a few fun ones thrown in there.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.100
Not important, don't wanna dwell on it.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.340
So went out for dinner again with the family

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.540
and that was Wednesday night.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.720
And we got up Thursday morning,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.780
had yet another awesome brunch at the hotel

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.940
and drove back and dropped me off at work,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.350
around two-ish, and tried to get caught up on the day job,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.290
which I've, I just started this job and I think.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.530
Wait, let's not go into that one.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.570
I'm not done with Star Canada.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.410
Well, we can bounce back.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.090
We can play a little ping pong.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.610
I spent the morning and I went through your slide decks.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.310
Brandt, my post editor.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.280
Sure.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.780
Well, we had the...

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.880
Let me just tell you, for those of you

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.720
that are not watching the video feed,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.600
Brandt has notes written down that he's taken

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.800
while reviewing my slide decks post-presentation.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.560
For now, he will grill me on some questions

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.120
on why I used a non-serifed font

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.040
on slide 33 of my keynote.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.720
No, I thought serif was an excellent choice for slide 33.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
All right, excellent.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.960
First and foremost, I'll say your slides were gorgeous.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.360
I make beautiful slides.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.360
Yeah, my absolute favorite were the ones where you were,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.920
you didn't have the text in your notes,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.840
but based on how you and I have talked about on AB,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.160
it was very clear the message,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.440
and the one where you had the picture of the Avengers

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.440
and the champions of quality, followed by the last defense,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.720
followed by the janitors.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.700
I'm like, I could talk to these slides.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.540
I have no idea.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.380
Right, the whole line there is like,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.740
we are the champions of quality.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.860
We're the last line of defense.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.300
Do you know who else is the last line of defense?

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.500
These guys with shovels and buckets.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.650
I didn't understand, you had one slide

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.250
that had Bieber on it, and I'm like,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.210
I don't understand the Bieber reference here.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.100
Well, let me tell you, Justin Bieber is Canadian.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.460
Oh, that wasn't the point.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.900
The point is, is that whole slide,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.660
I had two slides just trying to emphasize,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.020
not just how, we've talked here about how much has changed

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.740
in the way we develop software since I wrote that book.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.300
It's been dramatic, but that's happened for,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.220
it hasn't happened because of fate.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.060
The world has changed massively

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.260
in those last seven years.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.500
The iPhone came out in 2007.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.100
Netflix announced streaming in 2007.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.220
Israel, I started writing the book in January 2007,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.300
Justin Bieber was not around.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.660
It was a world without Bieber.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.980
It was also a world where Blackberry was relevant,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.100
and I made this crack, and on that slide also

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.700
is the Blackberry, and I said Blackberry was relevant,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.530
and it got a lot of laughs, and then I felt bad

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.050
because I found out later there was someone

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.610
there giving a talk from Blackberry.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.690
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.530
I'm such a shithead.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.830
Hey, you know what?

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.510
The other thing too, like on test is dead.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.620
It reminds me, there's one of my mentees

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.980
that I've been helping with in the last couple of months

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.740
has had an issue where they are in

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.660
sort of a real data science team,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.940
not one of these things that you see in Windows.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.540
Not one of the ones with air quotes.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.060
Right. Right, okay.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.820
But they're doing mostly data engineering work right now,

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.140
and that's not their talent,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.020
and it looks like they might be on route

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.420
to not receiving a positive review message.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.360
Well, let's just do it without.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.040
And so I've been working through,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.120
and the question around is test dead?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.560
This is what triggered this thought,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.800
and then looking at your slides

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.960
and knowing sort of what your message was.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.980
It's one of those things where test is not dead,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.860
testing is not dead,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.760
but I firmly believe testers are dead.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.720
Well, somebody whose role is entirely that,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.360
and there will be people,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.800
I'll leave out names because they'll get all huffy,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.160
but there will be people who will vehemently

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.480
disagree with us, but I think they're wrong.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.800
It's a probabilistic discussion, right?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.340
Cobalt is not dead.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.020
True, true. But it is.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.980
Well, did you catch, one of the things I'm really,

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.620
I'm gonna blog, the next thing I'm gonna blog about is,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.060
it's one section of my slides where,

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.020
I'll see if I can walk through it.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.420
There are people, and for a long time,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.980
I believe this too, software was made by

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.700
this sort of triad of people.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.700
They were mostly, they were developers and testers

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.580
and some sort of PM, whether that's project manager,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.820
program manager, whatever.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.820
Those three groups make software.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.700
And they are exclusive, like you do this,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.900
you do this, you do this.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.860
What else would you need?

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.900
But more and more we realize,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.620
especially as there are no titles,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.080
it makes it easier to see, or not no titles,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.040
a single title, is that there are a dozen,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.200
or two dozen, or 50 things,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.920
50 skills you need to make great software.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.360
So that's actually where I have the pie charts

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.440
of showing dev stuff, PM stuff, test stuff

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.600
for the remainder.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.640
And that's not really not true.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.960
What's really true is this pie chart

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.160
that shows 20 different things

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.320
of things that go into making software.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.320
And part of those are tester skills.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.680
But if you're gonna say,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.640
if you need to have a software tester,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.280
you're also gonna have a,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.040
you're gonna have specialists all over the place

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.000
and as you know we believe in specializing generalists,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.200
generalizing specialists.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.680
I think tester skills absolutely will be needed

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.620
forever and ever and ever and ever.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.200
But that may not be what you're called

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.040
or what you would do all the time.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.280
No, the thing is when someone comes up to me

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.260
and they ask, is test dead?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.820
Generally I've noticed that what they're really doing

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.360
is they're saying, hey, is my career screwed?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.440
And unlike what you do in our approach

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.440
when these type of things,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.280
what you said in your slides,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.680
I agree, because you said testing is not dead.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.780
But the thing I want these people to understand,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.850
if listening to Ellen's message

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.010
leads you to have hope that you don't have to do

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.110
a career change or consider it, you're wrong.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.150
Well, when I talked about the pyramid,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.570
which was also in my last,

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.550
this is something I brought up in our-

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.510
You understand my point there?

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.430
Yeah, I do, I do, I do.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.650
And I'm going somewhere with this,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.150
just ticking along the way to get there as usual.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.230
When I interviewed for my current job,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.430
which we'll talk about a little bit, maybe later,

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.710
I came up with this idea of this pyramid

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.470
of kind of where quality comes from.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.350
And then it's kind of resonated with me.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.990
And so I drew a picture of it and put it in my keynote.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.830
People came up to me and said,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.390
that picture resonates, can I use that?

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.870
And it's not perfect yet, I want to work on it.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.900
But there's these levels of culture

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.880
and functional quality and moving up to the top

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.940
where you have non-functional requirements

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.580
and then customer connection,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.740
the abilities explored to our testing,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.100
things are a little bit more customer connected at the top.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.440
And I talked about the role testers will play in,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.550
actually the role testers will play in that pyramid.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.310
And at the bottom, it's functional testing,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.170
it's advisement and code review

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.110
and making sure helping developers,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.910
implementers, I should say, implementers,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.910
write better tests.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.150
I agree that when people here is tested,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.910
they worry about their career.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.950
And I think if you're a great critical thinker

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.150
and a great systems thinker,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.240
you have long-term employment in software.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.000
There are testers I know

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.500
who just write functional tests all day.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.360
Those people perhaps,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.900
if they don't want to be an implementer, a developer,

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.980
they want that to be their job,

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.620
they perhaps have something to worry about.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.460
Because I don't believe that will exist.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.460
I don't think it's perhaps at...

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.420
I'm being nice.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.420
I know, I know.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.900
The thing is even,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.540
and I agree with the world that you're weaving,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.020
but even in that world,

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.250
there's not going to be room

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.800
for all the people that were at Star Canada.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.800
It's the cream of the crop

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.640
are gonna be the ones that hold

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.200
those pure testing positions.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.560
If you love functional testing,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.020
then you better be the world's best functional tester.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.660
And I literally mean the world's best functional tester

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.180
if you want to keep that job.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.240
In my head, I pictured a title on LinkedIn,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.090
Functional Test Coaching Consultant.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.170
Yeah.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.480
But who are you consulting?

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.760
Right, that's the challenge.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.680
I don't know.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.280
So anyway...

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.640
It's not like we don't have

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.640
enough testing consultants today.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.760
Right, I know.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.160
And enough...

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.500
Wait, we don't have enough good ones.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.240
All right, so anyway,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.720
I thought the message was received pretty well.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.080
People got that,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.600
oh look, test is changing.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.200
In fact, even when I was done,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.120
and I picked on Lee during the keynote, Lee Copeland,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.840
and Joe Ville, it was fun.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.680
Lee's a good guy.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.500
I know, he's fun.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.760
I made a comment about when I said

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.240
Microsoft didn't have any testers,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.960
so I started talking about no testers,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.680
and I'm saying this at a test conference,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.240
and I said, Lee, you know why I'm saying this?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.500
Seven or eight years ago, when this book came out,

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.360
I really wanted you to give me a keynote,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.620
but no, you waited until I wrote a blog post

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.980
saying that the book was out of date,

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.740
and then you said I should give a keynote

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.700
and talk about it.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.700
So to get back to you,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.740
I'm gonna come back to your test conference

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.020
and tell you that we don't even have any testers.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.940
What do you think about that, Copeland?

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.340
What did you say?

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.180
He laughed.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.020
What else is he...

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.300
But even afterwards, when I gave the message,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.860
and people, everyone I talked to afterwards,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.700
they got it.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.900
They got that test is changing.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.340
And Lee came up afterwards and said,

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.580
and acknowledged the Whitaker is test ed talk

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.820
from four or five years ago and said,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.220
but what's really important there

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.220
is that testing as we know it, dead.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.700
It's changing.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.780
And people get that.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.620
That's cool.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.700
So I don't know what that means,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.600
or I don't know enough about the jobs all these people do.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.740
I think about half the people there

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.660
are sort of in that test development role.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.440
Half of them are in that exploratory test,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.420
functional test role.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.420
I think I don't have a statistically significant sample.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.980
The test discipline,

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.760
whether or not it's dead,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.960
it is much better to default than it is dead.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.320
That horse that we're beating is not only dead,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.480
it's decomposing and smelling up the room.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.320
I know we have a lot of people who actively listen to us.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.300
No, we don't.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.730
We used to, but then we started talking like this.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.650
They still listen because it's a teaser.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.550
They hope that we'll get to something interesting

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.370
any second now.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.850
Eventually they're gonna say something really cool.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.810
Come on, come on.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.270
And then that outro music starts and they go,

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.450
man, maybe next time.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.570
So there's a bunch of things that I wrote notes on.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.490
I'm not gonna torture you on all of them.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.330
Oh, thank God.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.770
I had written down,

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.050
you had one slide around let's play a game.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.370
And then I'm like, what the hell is this?

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.210
War games.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.730
I got one through the other slides and I'm like,

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.650
oh, okay, this is fun.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.730
And I got every single one wrong.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.610
As did, I did it in the room.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.930
Actually I did that, say I've done that three times now.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.210
I got to get rid of those slides.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.210
I stole those slides from our experimentation platform team,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.730
who the leader of when we had one.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.290
We still have one.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.130
Just our buddy doesn't lead it anymore.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.170
Anyway, I stole those slides.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.370
I used them in a keynote at Star East

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.890
when I talked about years ago,

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.250
talking about customer data.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.450
Back in the days when it wasn't telemetry

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.490
like you and I used today,

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.810
it was all about Squibbon Watson and some other things.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.570
Send a smiley, send a frown, et cetera.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.650
And in a room, that keynote was about four or 500 people

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.690
and I got, I stumped all but three

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.080
with those three questions.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.920
So.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.300
How many time do you get them to consider?

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.500
I give them 10 seconds, so.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.740
Sure, that's enough time.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.940
That's plenty of time.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.620
And again, not looking at the slides,

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.420
the whole idea is showing them an A-B test

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.500
and letting them take a guess

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.020
at which one they think is better.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.860
And then we show them what the data showed.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.860
And the whole idea is between these three A-B test samples,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.100
we can show them that as much,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.500
as great of intuition as you think you have,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.580
you are not the customer using customer data.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.940
Much better way to see what's a better choice.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.100
And it's much faster.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.300
There was one where you said that

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.380
one result was 64% better.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.220
Yeah.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.300
Right, that 64% better.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.380
It doesn't take much work to equate it

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.300
to actual dollar signs.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.300
Sure.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.860
And one thing to keep in mind

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.740
that before going too deep,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.060
and you know this, is we're really lucky at Microsoft

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.500
and because of our size is that we can get

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.700
a significant sample size

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.260
in order to make these choices very quickly.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.070
Whereas some other companies may not.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.190
Yeah, there was one comment you made

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.750
around the sample size.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.480
And one thing I think a lot of people don't realize

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.280
is that depending on the data set,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.160
you don't need that large of a sample.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.480
The point is to be careful.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.800
And that, what you're talking about

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.760
is taking from a post I found from someone on the internet

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.520
who had done, he had done AA testing,

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.440
because he was lazy.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.840
He used the A-B testing tool

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.880
to just test the one version of his email

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.760
and was able to get statistically significant

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.000
according to the calculators online,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.530
differences between the two emails.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.410
But when he looked at it a little bit closer

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.850
it was his sample sizes just weren't big enough.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.410
When you have a small sample size, then you-

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.690
Your confidence level's low.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.130
You have to publish it along

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.410
with your confidence intervals.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.450
Absolutely.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.570
And that's what's missing a lot

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.490
actually the tools they use,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.770
I forget whether we used Google's tools or someone else's,

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.250
but those confidence levels are critical.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.530
And they never, we're used to a world

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.530
where they don't publish those confidence levels

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.490
along with likelihoods.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.810
We see that in elections every year, right?

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.850
Well, we see, no, if you pay attention,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.130
almost every poll I see says,

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:16.650
hey, there's a 52% chance that so-and-so is gonna win,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.170
plus or minus 17%.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.450
I'm like, okay.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.810
All right, what else did you wanna ask me about

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.570
before we go on to something more interesting?

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.000
So I'm done with this one.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.480
So you've now got your new job?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.720
I do and so-

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.520
You sent me a mail saying that you were all jacked up.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.360
Yeah, there's-

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.200
It was a kick-ass job?

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.880
Yeah, it's going well.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.240
And I only feel bad that I had my first full week

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.840
on the job and then I took three and a half days

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.480
to go to Canada to this conference,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.400
planned in advance, and lots going on, very busy,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.520
nice high-pressure stuff.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.560
As I mentioned before in the blog cast,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.120
the blog cast podcast,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.560
this is the first time I've ever worked for a manager

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.120
I didn't know before.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.680
And he's funny, he's funnier than crap,

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.920
but he's pretty intense.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.040
So I gotta figure him out.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.240
It's gonna be an interesting time.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.080
Okay, I can help you with that.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.920
That's all I can say.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.320
We'll help, next time we go to lunch,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.400
we'll help you psychoanalyze your boss.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.840
Oh, I love, yeah, I'm psychoanalyzing him already,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.040
but he's pretty good, he's pretty perceptive.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.820
Lots of stories that I probably shouldn't share here yet

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.540
until I get to know my team better.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.300
I got a spare strength book in my office

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.980
you can take and get him to take.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.820
All right.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.820
If you want.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.380
Yeah, I think going to,

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.940
strengths would be interesting with him.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.580
I could probably predict him,

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.220
but as far as insights go,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.310
he's the reddest manager I've ever worked for.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.470
That's good and bad.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:51.400
And I'm not even sure if there's another color in his spectrum.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.240
Oh, interesting.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.810
He could have a little blue down there somewhere.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.410
Well, you hired you.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:58.610
Yeah, I don't know.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.210
Yeah, I don't know.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.250
So lots going on there,

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.370
probably a lot I shouldn't talk about yet

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.490
with an unannounced product,

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.610
but I'm getting some good high pressure work,

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.730
good visibility.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.770
Well, why don't you talk about the type of work

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.160
you're doing?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.720
As I've mentioned before,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.320
for people who missed the last podcast,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.520
I'm on a team of about 70 developers.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.480
I'm the only, I'm the quality guy.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.720
Doesn't mean I do all the testing.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.960
It means I, for one,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.520
kind of look at the testing that's going on

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.640
and help and audit and coach and correct.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.280
And right now our developers have what I'll call

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.360
a reasonable set of tests,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.760
but not a very good one.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.200
I'm working on helping them improve that.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.040
In fact, I have a meeting later today to go over that.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.760
One of the things we're going to fix is right now

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.160
they have a set of,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.840
and this is just mindset things.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.320
Because I look at quality pretty holistically

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.480
all the way up like the pyramid I talked about.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.720
And they have this set of tests that run at Check-In

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.080
for CI and then to make sure we promote one,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.920
a build from our sort of,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.880
we have two versions of our website.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.480
One is not two versions,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.240
but we have sort of a staging one

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.530
and then the production one.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.530
Things kind of bake in staging

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.930
and then once a day we promote those two,

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.250
our regular one that more of the audience is.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.570
It's unreleased, so production isn't actually production.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.850
Hackers out there, you can't find this site.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.650
Absolutely, absolutely not.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.720
Anyway, they call this whole thing the quality pipeline.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.360
I think that's overstating things a little bit.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.880
Let's find the new word for this over time.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.160
Right now, we have a review today

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.920
and a lot of the metrics that were prepared for this

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.000
are around test case counts per area,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.240
but you and I know are really.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.790
Oh.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.630
The leaves.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:50.790
The low hanging fruit is ready to be plucked from the tree.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.970
I look forward to the day where I,

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.330
there's like a good couple of years

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.170
where I hear that statistic.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.410
Well, and it's all over,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.850
and again, the reason is of course,

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.770
the educated listeners of this podcast

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.650
know that all test cases are not created equal,

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.170
area sizes are different.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.530
I'm gonna ask you, actually, I have some ideas for this,

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.210
but we're gonna move away from test case counts

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.730
because it's not a good way to measure anything.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.810
It may as well count Arm Harris as a measure of quality.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.690
So, what would you count instead?

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.960
If you wanted to, and again, maybe count nothing,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.720
but what's a good way for you would use,

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.920
and I'll give you my answer in a second,

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.880
to show status of sort of this pipeline

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.720
of test quality and product quality

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.520
going through, at least as measured by unit

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.720
and developer tests.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.600
You're adding constraints to the problem,

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.200
but I'm gonna ignore those for the second.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.440
Of course you are.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.360
The first thing that I would do facing that,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.420
and it's actually very similar to what I'm doing here,

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.250
is establish what's the goal we're trying to achieve.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.530
Right, and the term that I've been using here

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.870
is operational velocity.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.630
I know what that means.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.760
So, you're a system guy.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.760
What we're trying to do is get production-ready code

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.950
in the hands of the customer as fast as possible.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.590
Yeah, and you've heard me mention before

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.230
that for a long time I've considered my job

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.790
to make that build, measure, learn loop faster,

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.430
and that's what I think you're saying.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.430
It is.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.550
All right, so go on.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.390
But one of the challenges.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.790
I just wanted to pat myself on the back

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.350
that I actually acknowledge to our listeners

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.430
that we actually agree on something before you continue.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.910
Yes.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.590
I think I saw each of your slide decks

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.950
had a reference to that.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.790
I know.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.390
I referenced that in my third presentation.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.550
Sorry, I duplicate one slide.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.790
I think that was the only one I duplicated

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.670
in every presentation.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.810
Okay.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.610
And I think it's critical.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.690
Now, the situation in your case,

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.890
because if we wanna do production-quality code,

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.470
the first thing that I get people to realize

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:19.500
is there are multiple cases where it is faster

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.540
to achieve that goal of production-quality code

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.310
in the hands of the customer

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:30.310
by reducing what you test in a preventative fashion

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.470
and enhancing your telemetry

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:37.470
and optimizing for being able to react fast.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:42.530
So think of it even smaller than sort of a QFE class bug.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.200
The things that we want to prevent

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.600
are obviously catastrophe-level bugs,

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.280
but most people, you'll discover

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.050
that that's actually a smaller subset.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.260
I am now of the opinion,

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.180
if you don't know, let it go through.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.660
But instrument the crap out of that

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.420
and be fully prepared that if the results of it

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.100
are falling on the wrong side,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.420
your team has to be able to react to it

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.850
and fix it within 24 hours.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.690
24 is a long time.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.790
Okay, so most of the teams I've been talking to,

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:27.470
they go, 24, we can't do it shorter than seven days.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.950
So I agree with you.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.110
It depends on your content.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.950
All right.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.040
But that KPI,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.920
and what you're talking about, your pyramid, right?

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.920
So the first thing that I would do is I would say,

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.030
okay, now, how do I define production quality code

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.630
in the hands of the customer?

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:51.770
I need someone to play the role of the customer.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.690
Like in your situation, it's a V1.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.330
I don't know if you can do this,

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:56.850
but the first thing that I would do

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.130
is I would engage with MSIT

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:04.130
and find a way to flight this within the company itself.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.390
That will happen shortly.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:16.750
Bolster up, then create a KPI that says,

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:22.000
number one, what is our cycle time?

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:27.450
How long does it take, so when somebody has an idea,

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.130
to get it to the point of production quality code,

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.690
including if we have a testing pipeline,

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.530
or if we have to react to bugs to get it there,

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.930
that timer doesn't stop until we go,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.090
yes, it's now production quality,

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.970
it's making the customer happy.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:48.110
We wanna know what that cycle time is.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.310
We then will also wanna know the throughput

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.030
of getting new releases out.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.910
Because we don't wanna create a,

00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.150
we don't wanna over-entrench around this preventative model

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.990
and realize that the consequence

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:06.080
is that we're only creating a new release every two months.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.920
Because that makes the build, measure, learn loop too slow.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920
Way too slow.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.120
So it's really a first thing is really around

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:19.280
establishing those two or three key KPIs.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.280
There's one that I'm forgetting right now,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.670
but what they're called are tension metrics.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.550
Where you, for example, if we had a thing of saying,

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.950
hey, we need to get deployments out

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.790
as fast as possible, right?

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.110
Well, more than likely, given most engineering teams,

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.750
they'll achieve that, they can get a new deployment

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.190
out every 15 minutes.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.030
It's gonna be crap-tastic.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.110
We have to have something that counter-bounces

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:46.210
that says, nope, we're gonna measure the time it takes

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.800
to make it non-crap-tastic.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.540
And the magical third one, I wrote a deck on this,

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.060
I can send it later.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.820
But by creating these tension metrics

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.820
such that the only way to make all of these things go good

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.370
is to change your behavior and measure

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.650
where you should optimize.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.540
Pre-production, post-production.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.910
Winding back to, so let's say we don't have

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.370
a post-production model, right?

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.130
Again, I can't emphasize enough.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.290
If you don't have a production model,

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.410
it is my opinion that that is the first thing

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:29.610
you need to fix.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.650
It is way more valuable than building up

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.570
another unit test suite.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.700
Can you describe a little bit more what you mean

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.460
by post-production model?

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:46.540
You need to have your efforts validated

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.560
by as close to real-world usage as you can.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.400
Okay.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.600
Right, this is along the lines of what we were talking about

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.640
from your deck before.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.480
Sure.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.280
You gotta get rid of this champions of quality.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.840
No, the customer is the champion of the quality.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.560
And we're clueless.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.120
So the model I used to say in a prior team

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.680
that was very effective is we don't,

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.840
it was a team motto.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.640
We don't know what we're doing.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.680
Right, it's intent, we know how to find out

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.360
but its intent was to block any sort of assumption.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.360
Assumptions, particularly when you're in the data space,

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.900
are critically dangerous.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:33.060
So you have to suppress intuition on conclusions.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.620
You can have an intuition around hypothesis to generate

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.940
and those are extremely valuable

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.140
but you have to suppress intuition on conclusions.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.020
Did I get it in the weeds?

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.860
What was your point?

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.700
Yeah, you're, you're.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.100
I am weed-tastic.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.260
I'm gonna get out my weed eater in a second.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.060
You asked me a question.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.180
So we were talking about post-production model

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.780
what that looked like and that was the customers.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.700
You have to get to the point where the,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.420
you have a signal generated from the customer.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.300
Here, my team, I'm calling it the

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.300
outside in perception of quality.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.260
A story.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.220
We measure, in my current team,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.590
we measure downtime events.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.670
We have a contract.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.070
So my team is Azure Compute.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.930
We're a VM in the cloud service.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.430
And when anyone signs up, we have a contract

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.950
around our service level agreement.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:33.980
How much we will accidentally knock your VM offline.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.660
And all of our competitors had the same thing.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.490
Now, we had a big incident the other day

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.200
where a customer was claiming that they were out

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.060
for nine days and we measured it

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.000
and we could only find 20 minutes.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:56.440
Now, one of the, the, the junior level guys

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.280
that I was interacting with was just like,

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.880
we're right and wanted to go fight the customer.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.000
And I'm like, hold on.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.540
Like, this is why you're not on the call.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:11.160
And number two, I want you to step back and think about it.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.000
Let's assume that the customer is right.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.960
What possibly could be going on

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.670
such that they are perceiving that they're out,

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:26.960
that's different from what we're measuring, right?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.250
When I talk about customer quality, it's,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.780
we're trying to snap to creating a signal

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.740
that aligns with the actual customer's perception

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.580
of what's occurring.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.820
That's all in the matters.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.540
And so we came up with an algorithm.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.580
We haven't executed it yet.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.740
We're still looking for where the data is.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.460
But I firmly believe as an example,

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.580
like Azure Compute is multiple different services.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.940
We own the VM infrastructure, but the VM infrastructure,

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.880
it's just the VM infrastructure

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.220
and the networking infrastructure

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.500
and the storage infrastructure,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.620
you need all of these to have a successful

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.420
cloud computing experience.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.220
And they're all different teams.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.420
The my junior guy that I was talking about

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.560
is on the compute side.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.920
And I'm like, here's a hypothesis.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.880
If the network was out during that time,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.680
is it possible that the customer would perceive

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.480
that his system is down,

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.360
but we would still have the data that says

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.080
that the VM was up.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.690
He's like, well, yeah, actually it would.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.770
Okay, what if AED was down, the Azure Active Directory?

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.020
Network working.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.540
But the thing that manages identity,

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.720
person can't log in.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.560
What about that?

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.560
Would they view it as potentially their VM was down?

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.380
Well, actually, yes.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.220
Okay.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.460
Guys, you were talking in my head,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.900
I'm brainstorming through ideas.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.020
Well, there's a bunch of different ways

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.900
networking could be down or logging could be down

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.300
or the IP address could have changed

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.620
and they're accessing it,

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.000
all kinds of stuff could go on.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.400
Right.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.460
The path that I'm on right now,

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.390
I engage with our portal team.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:15.630
And so the customer only has a few ways

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.110
that they can interact with our service.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.790
They can go through our portal,

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.270
or once they've created a VM,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.070
they can just do a direct login.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.310
Okay.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.360
Starting with the portal team.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.280
What I want to look at,

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.570
the only, there's a common behavior.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:35.700
If the customer views that the VM is down,

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.340
what we've noticed is that they go do what's a CIR.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.740
They log into the portal,

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.900
they find the VM,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.820
they look at something,

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.100
we don't know exactly what,

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.880
but we have a whole bunch of smart guesses.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.660
And then the only tool that we give the customer,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.540
if they can't connect to their VM,

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.580
is to go to the portal and click the reboot VM button.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.400
Now, the thing I want to do is go,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.680
all right, let's look at all the customers

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.040
that hit that button in the last two months.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.500
Now I want to look at the sequence of 10 things

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.660
they did in that session before they hit that reboot button.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.340
And I want to aggregate those actions,

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.520
regardless of the order,

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.900
I want to aggregate those things

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.340
and I want to know what are the most common things

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.230
that they do just before hitting the reboot button.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.630
With the hopes that that's going to give me a clue

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.830
of what are they looking at to come to the conclusion

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.370
that their VM is offline.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.540
What do they see?

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.940
And with the idea that that's going to give me

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.820
a new signal to operationalize through the data set

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.980
and make my measurement of the subjective point of view

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:54.330
of the customer significantly more accurate.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.650
I think I actually did finish,

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:56.650
I've forgotten it again,

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.430
but I think I managed to ask you.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.450
Yeah, I think so.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.410
So pre-production.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.170
Yeah, my answer, look,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.990
to cut to the chase here on my side is yes,

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.370
I think the goal is to increase throughput,

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:15.370
how often can we get quality code to our production site.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.530
And part of that, it is a balance between,

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:23.760
I do think there is some learning and some growth to do

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.400
on getting developers to write quality code

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.180
and get that up to the site.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.920
So even our, I believe even our sort of staging server

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.260
can be higher quality all the time.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.740
So I do want to put some emphasis on having good tests

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.940
in there, pre-prod in there, but you're right.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.120
You do need to balance that with what,

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.760
having real people use it,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.360
whether they're exploratory testers right now

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.880
or customers eventually being able to get that data.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.360
And I want to loop this back to,

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.560
I don't know if you caught this in my track session

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.880
when I talked about 21st century customer

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.320
and it was really, the short story is,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.800
you need a balance of qualitative and quantitative data.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.200
And at the very end, one of the things

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.120
I sort of drove home is that in the old days,

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.360
we kind of, we had the ship criteria checklist.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.640
We go through, these are all things ready to ship.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.920
Best thing is getting your product ready to ship.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.000
But what's really important today

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.920
is not that just your product is ready,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.040
but that your product is ready to be used

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.000
and in your allies get that data

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.760
and your team is ready to get that data.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.080
So it's more than just the product itself, high quality.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.600
You have to have the ability to deploy

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.400
and analyze and update quickly to your customers.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.500
There was another quote that you said somewhere.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.720
I don't remember exactly how you said it,

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.880
but I think one of the key differences between the,

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.780
honestly between the world we left and the world today,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.520
it is significantly more important

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.400
that you're building the correct product

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.810
than to make sure that your product's correct.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.470
Yeah.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.910
And correct in this case is.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.510
Correct for the customers.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.870
And a quote I use all the time is it's,

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.710
in fact I tweeted this, but I said it

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.710
in my talk down on a slide,

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:17.840
but it is perfectly possible to use good engineering.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.680
I could use XP, maybe not, but bad example.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.920
I could use some pretty good engineering practices

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.200
to make really good functionally correct software

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.880
that nobody wants to use.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.720
Yes.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.500
And this is one of the reasons why I try to get people

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.640
to not overbalance about preventative.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.000
But the thing is,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.920
it really doesn't matter what you start with.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.440
As long as you are measuring those KPIs at the end,

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.350
and you have a learning loop

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:51.640
that you can measure where to do next.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.440
You need to start with a baseline

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.820
and then determine, hey, you know what?

00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:00.120
Looks like we're overdoing it on the preventative side,

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.500
and we need to push towards the optimizing morph reaction.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.900
The last thing I'll say on this particular topic,

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.700
I doubt it.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.840
And let's show something else.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.930
It is critical that your team has the idea

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:24.050
and the muscle that every build is RTM-able.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:31.000
There's a team that I walked through about six months ago

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.080
on how to scale up Agile.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.360
And I said, look, if you wanna make your life

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.130
way less complicated, what you need to do

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:48.100
is decouple engineering from the business decision

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.980
from shipping.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.040
And you make it very clear.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.220
The business guys, it's 100% our call.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:00.300
We could ship any build we want to at any time.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.820
Engineering gets no vote.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.080
What ends up happening when that happens,

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.620
engineering's like, holy crap,

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.860
we gotta make this RTM-able all the time.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:14.430
Yeah, there's a story I can't tell you for our listeners.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.230
Sorry, I'll catch you up again, I promise later,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.430
but remind me to tell you after we're done.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.230
Shh, it's a secret, secret stuff.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:23.470
Hey, I'm gonna skip your thing.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.310
Okay.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.110
Because the clock says I have to.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:26.950
So.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.150
Fair enough.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.390
Carl, what is that sound?

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.070
Do you hear that?

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:36.130
Mailbag!

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.090
So one of the things that we have today

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:43.030
is Alan has forgotten the mic stands.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.870
And it's interesting because he did sort of

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.590
a little singing lounge thing with the mailbag that time.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.710
That was actually cool.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.510
I think next time you do it, you should take off the.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.870
And I should stand up and do a little crooner pose.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.590
Yeah, can you do a mailbag like Elvis?

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.940
No.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.980
Well, practice that, next time.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.500
I can do mailbag only like Alan.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.540
All right, fair enough.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.920
Hey, so what's the mailbag, Alan?

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.460
I wanted to quickly give a shout out

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.980
to Nicholas Straw on LinkedIn,

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.340
who gave Brent and I a shout out

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.340
for introducing him to Conway's Law.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:21.100
As mentioned in episode something, I don't know,

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.840
a few episodes ago.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.600
But anyway, thanks Nicholas for listening

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.080
and for mentioning us on LinkedIn, very cool.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.920
And then.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.520
And I love the fact that he mentions

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.160
that he's one of the three.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.000
He is.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.600
There are at least five people that are one of the three.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.640
The one of the three brand is slowly building.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.920
Yeah, you know what, we should get,

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.530
oh, you know what, we need to make T-shirts.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.650
Like AB testing on one side and the back

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:49.250
that says one of the three.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.050
Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.890
All right.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:56.950
And go into production very soon, as soon as I remember.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:01.590
So the other one is, I'll tie this into a quick story

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:06.270
from my past through Star Canada into the mailbag item.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.590
So once upon a time when I was in engineering excellence,

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:09.950
I used to travel the country in the world

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.990
teaching courses to people, Microsoft people.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.510
And I visited just a hilarious,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.030
a really fun group of testers

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:23.030
at Microsoft's former office now in Long Island.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:24.070
Okay.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:25.870
I had gone out to speak at a conference in New York

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.790
and said, hey, well, I'm there in New York City.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.110
I said, well, I'm there, I'll take the train out

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:31.550
to Long Island and I'll teach these guys a course.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.390
So I didn't.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.990
I didn't even know we had a sub in Long Island.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.910
We did, that's where forefront was.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:36.910
Oh, okay.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.830
And anyway, I had a great time, fun guys.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.670
And then one of the guys, Mark, was at Star Canada.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.510
No!

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:44.510
But another guy I met out there,

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.550
Nathan, who left Microsoft a while back posted,

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.430
and you'll dig this.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:52.150
On the board, I just wrote,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.920
we should talk about monolithic test systems,

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.360
but he said, another great episode.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.920
He's also one of the three.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.000
I left Microsoft four years ago.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.960
I remember that the Windows org,

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.480
I was gonna say redactive, but what the heck?

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.240
Windows org was pushing this tool called WTT

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.440
across the entire division.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.520
In the context of this podcast central org theme,

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.240
how does WTT fit into the discussion?

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.400
Is it still being pushed as the way automation

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.760
needs to be run in the org,

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.560
or has it finally been dismantled?

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.880
Are other orgs continuing this longtime trend

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.880
of monolithic division-wide automation systems?

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.200
Actually, a very good question.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.840
And do you want me to go on and answer?

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.760
Do you wanna jump in first?

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.640
21, do you wanna take this?

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.280
It's actually interesting.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.530
It's actually interesting.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.410
Otherwise, we wouldn't cover it here

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.410
on the riveting A-B testing podcast.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.730
Yeah, I know, I use, I overuse interesting.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.890
It is an interesting adjective to me.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:58.060
I have come to refer to that particular tool

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.900
as part of the Windows Test Framework,

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.550
otherwise known as WTF. WTF.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.520
And I am very happy to say

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:16.220
that the idea of really bad, stupid,

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.620
monolithic test systems that don't solve the problem

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.580
that they're created for and create an additional burden

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.580
on the testers who have to use it seems to be gone.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.710
Oh, man, going away.

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.590
There are people that will hold onto those things.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:42.590
But monolithic test system is still around, right?

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:49.510
And it is growing, but it is now in a different context.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:55.430
The things I've seen coming out of the VS guys,

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:59.270
the things I've seen coming in from open source.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:05.940
What I find is what's happening is people are choosing

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:12.270
systems now instead of the systems being chosen for them.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.990
And as these systems are actually gaining customer following,

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.190
the required amount of flexibility,

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.310
the required amount of simplification,

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:25.950
the required amount of awesomeness for this type of thing

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:33.070
is actually causing convergence versus a forced convergence.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:38.710
So I would say monolithic stuff is still alive and well.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.910
It's just the command and control aspect.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.230
It's alive and well in a positive fashion.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.390
I'm gonna add one more twist.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:48.910
All that's true.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.670
And we actively went out, my last group,

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:53.470
which was part of the operating systems group,

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.350
which is largely made up of Windows,

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:58.350
we actively fought and avoided using WTT

00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:59.550
for many of those reasons.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.650
Did I ever tell you this story?

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:05.890
I was on a team, but so when WTT was first being constructed,

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.490
very small team, okay?

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.450
The architect did something very clever

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:12.090
and I liked his political strategy.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.650
What he would do is he would go around to executives

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.930
and he would socialize what they're going to do.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.650
And the executives would be bought in.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.490
Oh, this is fantastic.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:26.330
Great, I need you to contribute resources so I can build it.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.290
Okay?

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:30.350
Now, so I reported to an executive at that time.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.180
He came to me.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.140
I went and talked to the architect.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.740
I have a used car salesman filter.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.420
It doesn't work on me.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.860
Okay, that's great that it's shiny and polishy

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.580
and it'll clean Windows as well.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.020
But these are the things I care about.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.720
Tell me how it will do about that.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.140
Now, at that time, I owned a kernel mode driver

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.780
and one of the biggest things,

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.380
in other words, I was on a system

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.020
where if my devs did the wrong thing,

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.140
it would cause a blue screen.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:07.840
And WTT at that time wasn't resilient to that.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.940
I'm like, okay, so I crashed the machine.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.480
Where's the log stored?

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.760
Oh, it's on the machine.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.920
Yeah, but I was on the storage team.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.680
I'm like, I just took out storage.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.740
So are you saying that I just lost the steps

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.960
that caused this blue screen?

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.560
He's like, yeah, I think so.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.790
Okay, how do I work around that?

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:37.670
Oh, well, you have to wait a year.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:41.780
Okay, now my VP, he was getting pressure

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.810
from his chain of command on doing this.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:47.610
And I said, okay, here's the deal.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.930
He wanted me to go into it in some fashion.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.560
I said, here's the deal.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.620
I will pay for a vendor

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.420
and I will send that vendor over to WTT.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.780
Okay, and a vendor cost me 6,000 a week.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:05.780
He was expensive, but he did all of the database design

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.800
for that system, okay?

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:15.870
And my condition, if I do this, I don't have to use it.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:16.710
Okay.

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:21.850
All right, so what I was saying

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:24.690
before you told your story is I've forgotten.

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:27.930
Oh, I think everything you said about it earlier is true.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:30.090
I think people are moving towards other tools

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.410
and stuff's not being force fed.

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.650
One other twist that I've noticed is

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:39.090
because in a lot of these monolithic test tools

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:42.210
are now sort of owned, or at least the running of them

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.170
is owned by the implementers, the developers,

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:47.330
as they own more and more functional testing,

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.930
they're not standing up for some of the things

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:54.170
we accepted perhaps too long as testers.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:55.930
They're saying, I'm not gonna use this.

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:57.130
It kind of sucks.

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.090
This is way too heavy weight for what we need to do.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.130
And again, if all you're trying to do is prevent every bug

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.050
and find every bug before,

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.490
and we talked about that balance earlier,

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:11.690
they're really geared towards let's run

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:15.430
hundreds of millions of tests that take weeks and weeks,

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.250
and customers will still find bugs because-

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:18.450
We don't have the time for that.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:19.850
I know, I know, I know.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.730
One of the most critical things,

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.670
and I didn't see it called out on your deck,

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:26.850
but in terms of the 21st century customer,

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:30.810
I call this out every time I do a similar deck.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.160
There's a business imperative today

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.480
that didn't exist 10 years ago.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.340
And that is for all of these things, test tools,

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.790
your team's product, my team's product,

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:53.460
the switching cost is so cheap.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.500
Because the customers are just different.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:57.340
Customers are different.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.460
I don't have to take your crap.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:02.700
There's 10 more versions of you out on the web,

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.180
and I can go with one of them.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:08.940
And it is so easy for me to just try all 11 of them.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.940
I just saw a tweet from somebody I know

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.300
those last couple days, it says,

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.800
hey Uber, your app's buggy, so I'm switching to Lyft.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.340
Nothing about the quality of the service.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.300
The fact that the app's sucked,

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.580
they're gonna use somebody else's taxi service.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.980
Yeah, and it, like that.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.290
Yeah, it's like, oh.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:27.650
Everybody's like, hey, try the free trial.

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:30.370
It takes you three seconds to create an account,

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.570
log in, try the free trial, make a decision,

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:33.790
and go to the next one.

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:34.630
Exactly.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.120
That on-prem mentality where once we're locked in,

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.360
it's gone.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.680
Customers are fickle.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.520
Yeah.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.840
All right, Brent, the clock tells me

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.480
that it's time for you to shut the hell up.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.800
I'm shutting up.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.320
Except for this part.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.660
Except for the part where I say,

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.610
I'm not, I am, I am, who am I, I'm Allen.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:01.160
And I am Brent.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.400
Thanks once again for listening to episode 24,

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.240
and we'll be back with you soon.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.320
From the offices of a floor 24 in Lincoln Center

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.160
next time, right?

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.000
Maybe.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:13.840
Okay.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.680
Maybe.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.520
All right.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.360
All right, thank you.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.200
Later everybody.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.040
Bye.
