00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.030
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.550
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.550
Let's get started.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.650
We're back again for another ABT 343, and this time with another name I had to practice

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.050
to pronounce.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.850
Please welcome Yulia Bogre.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.140
Hi.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.180
Did I do okay?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.260
Almost but that's no problem.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I'll take a B plus.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.260
How are you doing?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.460
Oh, fine.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
Good.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.420
A very active member of our Slack community.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.140
Happy to have you as one of our three listeners.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.740
Always exciting for Brent and I to hear more about what's going on in the world of R3.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.780
And this is yet another COVID-19 edition.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.620
Brent and I actually recorded episode 118 this morning.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.260
The remote went a little better than last time.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.420
I'm excited to get that out.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.020
But enough about Brent.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.700
Today it's the AY podcast as I like to call it.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.820
And we have Yulia here to tell us all kinds of things.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.140
As you know, it's three questions for three listeners, for one of our three listeners,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.860
and tangents are allowed.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.940
I think a good first question that's worked with a lot of people is just tell me about

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.300
your path into testing and what you're doing now.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.710
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.790
I like how almost everyone was asked about it.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.950
And it's nice to learn about other people in our community.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.670
So comparing to others, I'm probably maybe the youngest one because my testing career

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.390
is just five years.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.390
And this is almost my whole career.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.510
I wasn't working as anyone else before.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.630
I just came to testing after the university.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.410
I'm initially from Kazakhstan.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:14.650
So my problem was that I wanted to start working remotely right away because my

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.650
current husband was working remotely too.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.490
So we wanted to go around the places.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:28.850
And I was very, very lucky to find the place as a junior in the remote, fully remote

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.890
company, which was specializing in testing.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.690
And they also provided testing courses for other companies, but for the employees

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.500
they were obviously free.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.420
So I had a place to learn from the start.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.780
And some of the people in that company or the community around it are actually very

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.900
well known in Russian speaking testing community.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.730
So I think it probably was the best place to start being a tester.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.900
And it wasn't a product company.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:20.740
We were mostly outsourcing or outstaffing because we were contracted to do that testing.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.580
But we weren't like throw of the board, some people do stuff.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.500
No, we were integrated into the actual development teams.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.460
So it was closer to real world product company.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.340
And my last project was the most important one.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.980
It was a government project.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.420
It was very, very big, very, very, very motivated to work on.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:59.430
And I also burned out on it hugely, but that's another story.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.110
And the best thing that what happened on it is that at some point, and I think I

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:15.120
don't know how you like it, I was on the crossroads to switch from the so-called manual

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:25.030
tester to either be automation engineer, like write Selenium how you like it, or to switch

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.550
to be integration tester.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.010
So in this case, it was a SOAP services.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:41.290
And I don't know how it happened, but it was me or my direct manager, who's my friend.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.390
And I decided to go to integration testing and not automation.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.350
And I think it was the best decision of my life because I really just a fan of API and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.010
everything that's about it.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.490
Well, you know, my opinion on that there's a level of hell that includes people who write

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.490
Selenium all day.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:12.260
Well, I actually write Selenium now, but yeah, it's, it's complicated.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.260
But I think it was very cool that at that point in my life, I decided not to do that.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:32.580
And to learn the actual skills and the area that was a bit different from usually is expected

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.700
to do from the testering career.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.460
And then I moved to the Canada, to Montreal, and I had to find local job.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.140
And it wasn't easy because, you know, you don't have a local Canadian experience.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.970
You don't have a French suitable to work.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.960
Like I mean, I can speak a bit, but it's not okay for day-to-day work.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.480
And also I was very picky because after that government project, I couldn't move to, you

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.920
know, to test some websites, some kind of, you know, like store pages and something like

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.920
that.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.160
And I also didn't want to work in Alsace and companies anymore because there's just not

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.760
enough level of agency stake in the game.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.720
When you, when you have conflicting interests, you are either working for your company or

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.580
for customers of that product or for who you're trying to work.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.840
So when I was looking for work here, I was looking for the product companies and the

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.980
product companies who do something meaningful.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:07:00.720
I found one and currently I am, I have a very mixed position.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.440
I write automation, yes, Selenium, yes.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.920
And even because of the some project problems, it's in Python.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.800
So it's not even easy stuff like, you know, Cypress or Task Affair.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.560
It's a bit harder to do that in Python.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.060
We don't have enough libraries in that language.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.060
I also do API testing, sometimes UI testing, which I hate.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.060
Okay, now I'm liking you more.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.060
Yeah.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:42.220
And I also not exactly test anymore, just this week, right?

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:49.520
This week, really, I think I'm starting to switch not being a tester at all.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.240
And I don't know real name for this position yet, but it's something about developer experience.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.240
What does that mean?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.240
We don't think of a name to it yet, but what will you be doing?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:07.400
So I don't know about how to properly name it because it's just two weeks ago, I actually

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.160
learned that there are special teams in some bigger companies that do that.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:21.640
Developer experience is all about, so user experience is for regular customers who click

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.480
buttons and do this kind of thing.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.630
And developer experience is for customers of API.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.930
So what developer experience team usually do?

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:44.770
Thus, it's creating API guidelines, creating or researching tooling to help writing better

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:53.210
APIs to enforce these guidelines, prepare documentation, and sometimes even development relationships.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:59.550
So when you communicate with your external or internal users of API.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.210
So that's kind of thing.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.310
Is it like developer productivity, would you say?

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.380
Or is this more on the experience side?

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.950
It's yes, yeah, it is.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:20.090
But there is a level of authority here because you're actually creating rules like, okay,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.930
we should follow this API guideline.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.400
And I need all of your input for it.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.320
So please leave your comments.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.000
But then this API guidelines would be enforced.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.020
It's just like we're making your life easier.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.660
Yeah.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.800
Yeah, and I think, I brought developer productivity because that's, if you've read the Google

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.440
software testing book, James Whittaker, or actually he delegated most of the writing of

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440
that book.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.640
But he talks about the move of quite a few of their testers into this developer productivity

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.620
role where the role was to make it easier for developers to do good work.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.450
And in your case, it's an interesting twist on it.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.930
I think it's good where there's some leadership aspect and some standards aspect.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.930
We're trying to, and this is the challenge.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.450
And my favorite leadership quote, which I've used on the other podcast quite a lot is leadership

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.370
is disappointing people at a level they can absorb.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.970
And I think in your role and your team's role, it's a lot about figuring out not just

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:28.810
how many processes and guidelines can we make the team follow, but the right ones to make

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:34.130
sure it's because the results of the process should be to solve a problem around productivity

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.930
or as you put it, their experience, improving the experience and things like guidelines that

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.570
make code more readable.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:47.760
Those are proven to show that they make code more maintainable, easier to refactor,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760
et cetera.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.430
So I love jobs like that.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:56.900
I have gravitated towards things that help internal developers do their job better.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.900
I'm a big fan of that kind of work.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.900
Are you excited to get started on that?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.900
Yeah.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:11.540
And that's why I'm hesitant to say that it's development productivity only.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.890
It's because it's not only internal developers.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:23.520
The reason is that we have external developers, external customers that want to use our product

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.520
in their solutions.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.560
Oh, that's different.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.480
That's really cool too.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.480
Yeah.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:37.640
So it's connecting these lines from our developers to them and making sure that all information

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640
is in place.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.200
Yes, yes, I get it.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.920
A long time ago at Microsoft, I worked on a product that had this primary customer was

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920
external developers.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.720
I remember working on a lot of tools there to help them be more successful and putting

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.970
on, I'm not sure if this is part of your, really part of your role or part of the

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.970
charter or not, but I remember putting together workshops for them both.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.410
They weren't online then.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.330
Today I do them online, especially today today.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:10.010
But I remember inviting a dozen or 20 of them to Microsoft to give them a couple days of

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.570
workshops on how to use our tools.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.860
That was a lot of fun.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.860
Nice.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.860
Yeah.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.500
It's actually one of the things that I was doing last week.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:28.200
It's we are preparing a API documentation and before we just didn't have it at all.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.560
So use cases and stuff like that.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.560
I'm excited about that.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.350
So you're working with a team of people working on the same thing?

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.550
Team of one.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.950
So just you all by yourself.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:46.350
Well, yes and no, because I need to connect with everyone.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:55.310
And this is how company approach I mentioned to you before the starting podcast is that

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:03.310
the very, not the very, the most important thing is that generally I see the testers,

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.370
they are like, okay, I'm doing my job.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.410
And that's it.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:16.050
But as I see it, the really good job comes when you actually try to interact with everyone.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:23.890
With not just developers and not just tech writers, though even sometimes I'm not using

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.330
testers don't even know who are tech writers.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.770
I remember that on my previous project.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.900
We didn't even saw the results of that work.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.940
But also these sales with marketing, because these guys are working with our customers,

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.940
with our clients.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.260
You should know what are they telling people about us.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:52.860
In case of our sales team, they really, I think it's our first line of defense of knowing

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.860
what actually customers want.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:03.320
Because our product is currently I think is most common on-premises installation behind

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.320
the firewall.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.410
We don't have much telemetry there.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.410
Nope.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.410
Yeah.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.370
We have a similar challenge to work with one of our products.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.170
But yeah, that's a challenge.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:21.290
Yeah, so people who work directly with customers are very important as a tester or as any other

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.290
member of the company.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:31.050
You should talk with every department to understand it.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:36.120
In our company, we have something called, how is it called?

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.320
Okay.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.560
I forgot it.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:45.480
But there is a management perspective of how the company should be open to everyone.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.040
So every month, we have a meeting where we discuss financial statistics, what's done

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.510
in marketing, what's done in sales, how we can help them.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:02.280
It's not just being in all your bubble, but go around and speak with these people.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.720
It sounds like a really fun job.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:10.340
And I'm already imagining some ways in which you may be able to apply modern testing principles

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.340
there.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.340
But I'm curious.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.140
So in your, you talk about only having five years of experience, but I think the number

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.140
isn't as important.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.860
It sounds like you've had a good variety and breadth of experience.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.290
So I'm curious how you've seen the modern testing principles manifest in the jobs you've

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.860
had and especially in the job you're going into.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:38.820
Because I don't have very good memory, I have a memo with the principles and I will look

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.300
into it and just go one by one.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.590
Brent and I don't have memorized either.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.710
So the first principle is actually what I was just was talking about.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.710
Yes, it is.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.710
Yeah.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:02.790
And I think last month, or maybe, yeah, I think it was last month, we actually, our

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:11.110
monthly meeting was suspended in preference of having the meeting to brainstorm our customers

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:19.710
who were in the red or orange zone from the support or from development or from the sales

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:26.420
perspective and generated ideas about how we can move them to green zone that they like

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.460
us more.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:35.460
And as a tester, we had lots of insight in this meeting because some of the customers

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.850
were in the red zone because we didn't know about their environment.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.960
And we weren't testing in that particular case.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.170
This ended up badly.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:59.160
So the priority is to understand that all our action can improve business in some way.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.890
So we need to go around to gather information about it and act on it.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:11.930
And that's where the second principle helps is system thinking, theory constraints.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:18.450
You need to understand where bottlenecks are, where problems arise, where is the loss of

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.450
feedback.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.450
Yeah.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.730
And especially all these are ringing truths.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:22.730
You're talking about your job.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.730
I'll interrupt for just a moment.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.970
But you're talking about you are the glue who's connecting a lot of different parts of

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.210
the organization together.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:29.210
That's principle two.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.210
Yeah.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.850
Oh, by the way, I remember there was a topic.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:37.610
There was some talk on the conference.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.530
Probably it was shared in our slack about being a glue person.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.530
Yes.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.530
Yeah.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.130
And it's actually what I like to do most.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:57.170
And I think Melissa in the previous episode said that in some of the job description, people

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.410
just assume that you will do one thing and don't go around with it.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.250
And that's not interesting at all.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:09.720
It's way better to be that kind of group to understand everything.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:17.300
Well, not being an expert in everything, obviously, but to help people do their job better.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.300
Yes.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.300
Yes.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.100
There are some of us like you and I and others who that's where we thrive.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.940
I love being the, as you've heard me call myself before, the specializing generalist.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.940
Yeah.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.720
And a lot about a little and a little about a lot.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.950
Yes.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.950
No.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:38.150
It's going back to the principles with principle number three.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:49.930
Well, yes, I can see us as a force of continuous improvement, but in my experience, safety net

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.820
culture is not going away.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:19:01.300
So I remember my previous company and its projects and well, they hired us because they

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.900
wanted safety net.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.900
Yes.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.900
Yes.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.340
But in your new role, as you described it, you have moved yourself upstream.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:19.970
There are problems with it, I think, because maybe our company sounds like a startup, but

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.680
you know, this openness and stuff, but it's actually not this very, very old company.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.750
We have such an old code.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:35.710
Our testing framework is written halfway in bash because it was written before they wrote

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.310
testing frameworks.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:45.220
So in this position, when you don't really have a lot of unit tests and stuff, yes,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.110
testing team is safety net, unfortunately.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:56.870
And to go from not from being safety net and not being safety net, you need a lot of stuff

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.790
to do, a lot of time to do.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.350
It's not one year or two years.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.740
I think it will take a time.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:09.540
So that's why I'm a bit skeptical when you say that there is so the tip and port or not.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.220
No, I don't think so.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:19.640
I saw that several companies on my previous work and there was many people who are still

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.440
where they rely on testers.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.480
Sometimes Brent and I choose to ignore those.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.200
And I've often used the diffusion of innovation curve that was made famous in the Crossing

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.280
the Casa book that shows that there are always be lagers.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:39.400
There'll be the, I forget the names of the sections, but we're not on the super forefront

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.640
of innovation, but we're out on the front of the curve.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.960
It just means that a lot of companies are still back there.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.720
Some will stay back there, but we're hoping.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.640
But as you know, as you've seen from talking to people on the Slack channel and hearing

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.360
other talks about modern testing, this is happening whether Brent and I were going to discuss

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360
it or not.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.480
We just put a name to some things we were seeing that we liked.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.440
So it's going to happen.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.520
In some companies we know it's going to take a long, long time.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.120
And the problem is that there is a kind of bias.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:19.400
People who participate in Slack or even in testing survey, there are active people.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.610
And I don't think that many people in testing community are active people.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.800
There are a lot of basics there.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.440
So I think there is a kind of a bias in the way of saying the whole picture.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.360
Maybe there should be some scientific study, but actually, you know, pick up companies at

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.860
random in different countries, you know.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.860
Yep.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.980
And any of the surveys that come out, it's hard because the testers at those companies

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:55.540
aren't really involved in the overall internet testing community very often.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.360
Somehow you grew out of it anyway.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.360
But we don't always get a fair sample size when we do testing surveys or testing polls.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.360
Any other principles you wanted to call out as interesting in the scope of the work that

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.130
you've seen?

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:17.250
Well, I have anything to share about the principle number five.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.250
Love it. Bring it on.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.250
Yeah.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.410
Customer capable of only customers capital judging quality.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:31.010
So that government project, I mentioned that I had the burnout from it.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:37.850
And one of the reasons was that we were not really allowed to communicate with customers,

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:45.300
but we were seeing support tickets because we were the people who were called test analysts

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.460
and we had the task to analyze last level of support stuff.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:23:01.460
And sometimes we saw things like people naming us alcoholic drunkards and stuff like that.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:07.460
And I think a month ago I saw an article where in the comments people mentioned that they

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.460
didn't even think that this project had any testers at all.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.460
Yeah.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:22.550
That was not very good for your mental health because you know, you work hard, you try to

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:29.550
work hard, but this is government project and laws change and you need to change with

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.550
it very fast and sometimes laws doesn't make sense.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:41.550
In our case, we actually had a problem when people try analytics, try to design the requirements.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:48.900
They say this is some law doesn't make sense in conjunction with another law.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.900
And they had to propagate it to the government that they should change the laws because we

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.900
cannot develop it like that.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.900
It won't work.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.900
Yeah.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:10.640
So in this case, the problem for me that even though we work hard, you know, and people

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.640
like management team was saying that yes, you're doing everything we can.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:24.640
But because there was not enough feedback from us to customer to explain to them why we

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.640
have some problems and or we know we have these problems and we're working on it.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:37.920
But there are some priorities in place that contradicted and something like that.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:45.040
We I still see that generally external developers hated it.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:50.970
And OK, and this is all that matters in the end.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:58.040
When you see that, yeah, you do your hard work, but people just don't like it.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040
That's it.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.480
It doesn't matter what quality culture you have if people don't like your product.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.000
Yeah.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Yeah.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Wow.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.480
That's that's that's quite a story.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:20.860
It does show that I mean, although you can the point that really struck me in there is

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.860
the thing Brent and I don't want to see people or testers move past is the idea that

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.860
they're responsible for quality.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.860
You know, if the customer is complaining about quality, shouldn't just be one part of

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.860
part of the organization feeling bad.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.050
Everyone should feel bad.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:40.050
Well, I think in that case, developers definitely felt bad.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.050
OK, good, good.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.050
Long as everybody's in a little bit of misery, it seems fair.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.240
Yeah, it seems fair.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240
That's great.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.240
I'm you know, you've brought up a few times that I mentioned earlier that you're five

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240
years of experience.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.240
But in that five years, you certainly I certainly wasn't as far along in my career

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:03.370
as far as thinking about things and thinking about systems thinking, thinking

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:08.530
about how I could affect bigger parts of the team.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.530
So the things you're thinking about I was not doing five years into my career.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:12.530
So I'm impressed.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.530
And another thing I've been impressed about is how much and of course, you know,

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:17.530
I'm old enough.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.530
There really wasn't much of an Internet when I was five years into my career.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:25.530
But you're all over the Internet, but not as Yulia as this name I can't

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:31.850
pronounce. I hope you can help me with it's obvious case office costs.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.360
Help me out and tell me where that tell me more about that name.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:43.620
So there is no proper pronunciation because it was created to be unique

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.780
enough to be searchable on the Internet.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.780
You are so much smarter than me.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.640
Yeah.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:59.640
So at first, it was a very long time ago when I was a teenager and I had

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:06.640
to come up with a nickname and we were looking for the I think it was

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.710
Latin dictionary and I was sounds great.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.710
It's birth in Latin, you know, teenagers.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:20.250
And then I found out that it's not very unique nickname and I had to

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:26.410
extend it somehow and I just added some suffix like case.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.410
Okay, whatever.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.410
So it's now with a viscous.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:35.410
But generally when people need to pronounce it a lot like in video games,

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:40.480
they just tell it like I was I've been so that's it.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480
That's the story.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.480
But the fun part is that at first it was a viscous result.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.340
And then I added because it makes it even more unique.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.910
Wow.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:28:01.450
You have such foresight to do that because I've told there's a long story

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.450
on my blog about where the name Angry Weasel came from.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.450
But it is not a unique name.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:11.450
In fact, there is another angry weasel on Twitter who has posted one post

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:15.450
ever like six years ago and can't get their handle from them.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.450
And of course, Alan Page is the name of a famous American football player.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.450
So there's no uniqueness about me.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.450
And I've become searchable as I've gotten older.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.450
But that is so smart.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:32.450
Yeah, I did a little bit of internet stalking and I see GitHub repos

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:38.450
and references to your GitHub repos on Stack Overflow conversations.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.450
It is highly searchable.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.450
Someone by the way, if you search your name,

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.450
one of the third posts down is someone thanking you for something

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.450
you posted to one of your guests on GitHub.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.450
Oh, no.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.450
Oh, that's a very bad story by the way.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:58.450
I admittedly only skimmed, but it was something about installing Postman,

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.450
I think, on Linux.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.450
I broke Postman.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.450
Yeah, I broke Postman at one time in my life.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:09.450
It was so apparently GitHub doesn't send you a notification

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.450
when people comment your guests.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.680
So I didn't notice that it was very popular.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.680
I just created it for me to be able to install it.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.680
Which is what those are supposed to be for, but yeah.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.800
Yeah, but people started finding it, commenting it, using it.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.800
And I'm not using Postman by the way.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.800
And I'm actually kind of against using it now.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.800
I saw you have a blog post talking about that.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800
Yeah.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:41.800
And every day it got worse for me because I think they are

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.800
almost like sole PUI now.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.800
People just assume that for pay attention you need Postman

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.640
and that's it.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.640
But that's gentle.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.640
So one day, their support team from Postman approached me

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.640
and said that they implemented native installation

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.640
and native update.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.730
And people who used my yeast install Postman are not able

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:13.730
to update it because I had some special, I think I was

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.730
installing it on the root.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.860
So they actually had to trace it to the my yeast

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.860
and asked me to update it.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.860
You are internet famous.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.860
That's fantastic.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.850
That's just one thing.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:29.850
That's a wonderful story.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.850
So the good news is I'll put a link to your blog here,

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.850
but people who want to find out more about you

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.850
and just kind of find random information about you

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.850
can just search on Avas case, Aviscus,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.850
however you want to pronounce it.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.850
That's what I want.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.850
It doesn't matter, but that is so smart.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.850
That should be every teenager should do that.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.850
Everyone should actually work harder to find a unique name

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.950
versus their first and last name plus some numbers afterwards.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.950
I'm so impressed.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:01.950
This has blown my mind.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:06.110
It's made my whole month and it's only April 3rd.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.300
Well, the thing is that my first and last name

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.300
is pretty unique as well, at least in Kazakhstan, Canada.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.300
Yes, but no one wants to be stalked on the internet

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.300
by their first and last name.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.490
It helps you separate the person from you,

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.490
the internet personality.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.780
That's my take on it.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.780
All right, we are out of time, but this has been great.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.780
I've loved talking to you.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.780
Thank you for volunteering to be on the show.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.780
It's been great.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.780
And any last words or are you on Twitter?

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.360
No.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.360
You don't seem like a Twitter person,

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.360
but I will give the links to your blog in the show notes.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.160
Anything else I should point to?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160
I don't think so.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.160
If somebody just wants to talk to me,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.160
just ping me somewhere where you find me.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.160
Good advice.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.160
Good advice.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.160
All right, well, thank you very much.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.160
Have a wonderful weekend and good luck with the quarantine.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.160
Good luck to you too.
