00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.270
the AB Testing podcast three questions about almost anything.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.590
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.770
Let's get started.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.930
We're back again for another episode of ABT 343, and I'm here this time with Machi

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.930
Zarek.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.610
Hi, thank you to be here.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.610
It's very exciting.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.570
And that was to see how it go.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.810
It's more exciting for me.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.210
I am excited about this series.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.170
I think they a lot of good insights from listeners of the podcast and people

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.170
practicing modern testing.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.930
I'm also looking forward to maybe in the future, having people who don't agree with

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.930
the principles, who have some conflicts, think that'll be fun thing to do.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.130
But I don't think that's going to be the case today, but we'll see how things go.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.520
Yeah, we'll see.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.520
Great.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.320
So I know that one of the things is you, I named dropped you in my recent

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.120
Ministry of Testing course on modern testing because you took, Brent and I did

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.800
in the eighties of our podcast, a lot of deeper dives into each of the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.280
principles and you created a mind map of that, which is super helpful.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.520
And just I want to thank you again for doing that work.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.360
And I think it's going to be continually valuable for people trying to get their

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.360
head around how these principles can be applied and how they work with each other.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360
So thanks again for that.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.720
My pleasure.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.240
I will admit I am, I really like to learn from mind maps.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.760
So that's why it was created.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.880
Well, I was trying to do article for one of the, let's call it a blog scene

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.200
Paul, Paul and about modern testing.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.280
And I needed to, you know, sorry it's in my head.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.320
So I walking my dog, I was taking notes from your past episodes and I was

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.640
complaining, giving that mind map.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.560
My only problem with it is that the current format is not very good for

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.400
you know, contribution from other people.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.440
I'm trying to figure out some better ways for it to work in the future.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.760
But for now I don't have any ideas how to tackle that problem.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.280
That's interesting.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.200
We need a mind map diff tool.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.100
Yeah.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.340
You know, actually I found some way.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.100
I found recently that there is some plugin for the X mind to use

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.260
Python to, you know, to make a different format from it.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.060
And I'm thinking if it's possible to, you know, to use it to start the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.700
mind map in getting some other format and shows, you know, auto-generated.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.460
But I haven't yet started looking at it.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.180
I would probably use it as one of my programming challenges in future months.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.180
That is super interesting.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340
Speaking of, we're going to start right off with tangents here, but

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.380
speaking with about programming challenges.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.980
Uh, in case I forget to mention on the podcast next week, it's almost time for

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.060
the fact tomorrow, the advent of code programming challenge starts.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.260
I don't know if you've ever done that before.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.350
No, I was listening to when you were doing it last year or two years ago,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.310
but I haven't taken time to participate in it last, uh, last year.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.150
I am thinking about trying it this year, but I don't know if I will have time

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.710
because I'm doing my own challenge in the meantime.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.190
So we do.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.070
I've never finished it.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.950
I've started it every year for about the last three years.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.750
And it's a lot of fun.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.710
It's, uh, in my current role about the, almost the only programming I get to do.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.350
But it's, it's fun.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.590
Last year I did it in JavaScript and which was both good and bad, but it worked.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.350
I might try.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.270
Why did you choose JavaScript for it?

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.430
That would be challenging.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.670
Uh, I don't know exactly.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.750
It was convenient.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.150
I think it's, I don't recall my reasoning.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.270
I think it was convenient.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.630
I was on.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.700
Yeah, I don't know.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.620
JavaScript is popular.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.140
Maybe see what's going about it.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.420
And that means no, no, no.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.580
Why I didn't choose that.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.820
The advent of code always has two challenges.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.820
One that's kind of hard.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.660
There's always a follow-up that if you're lucky, your initial solution is,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.060
it's easy to bolt on, but if you're unlucky and you solve the first problem

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.260
in a weird way, you have to basically rewrite something.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.580
And there was one where you had to figure out where someone would be on the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.700
thousandth iteration of some complex maze or a thousandth step.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.380
So did the code to figure that out.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.620
And I say, now imagine the character has gone.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.700
It was like 10 million steps or no, it's more than it's like,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.260
it's like 10 billion steps.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.980
Okay.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.980
If I was in a type, a strongly typed language, I would have to change my

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.940
integer types and redo a whole bunch of stuff with large ints, et cetera.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.500
But JavaScript doesn't care.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.340
I just added a bunch of zeros and ran it again.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.500
And it took, took three minutes or so, but I still got the right answer.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.500
Yeah.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.140
And that is the power of the soft typed languages that you can

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.820
do lots of that kind of stuff.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.380
I'm not saying it was a good thing.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.540
I'm just saying it worked.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.960
Yeah.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.440
I am currently playing with the JavaScript because we are taking look into the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.280
puppeteer and other solutions.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.360
And my biggest pain is that the bug fortunately,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.280
Visual Studio Code is giving some good options, but it's still not on the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.360
level that other languages and other IDs have for that.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.420
I definitely hate JavaScript more than I love it, but let's have a three for

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.060
three podcast.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.460
And, uh, I'm not going to edit any of that out because I think it's all

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.700
super valuable and interesting, but ABT three, four three is a podcast for

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.180
people who have at least some knowledge of modern testing.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.340
And I know you have, as we've spoken of before, uh, more than above average

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.700
knowledge.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.100
So for the first question, can you talk a little bit about two part question

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.060
about how you've seen modern testing work and how you can maybe some ways

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.340
that you've got teams to where you've snuck it into the job, where you've got

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.900
teams to adopt some of the modern testing principles without knowing they're

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.260
doing it.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.220
Okay.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.860
So, um, I will start with the second part because he's much more

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.300
a recent situation for me.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.460
Um, there is currently a new project starting.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.140
Well, it's not exactly new project.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:19.220
The old project is returning for another release and they had few problems.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.020
Basically regression was taking five hours.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.860
And since this would be the probably the last release for that customer,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.580
you wanted to know, to improve it, to leave him with some better positions

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.220
in the future.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.220
And the plan was to try to put automation there.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.740
And I wasn't too keen on that because well, since this is a rest release, I

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.380
wasn't seeing the proper value of, you know, giving the end to end tests

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.140
there and after lots of discussions, we came to conclusion that actually the

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.580
biggest issue for the customer is that basically, um, the process when they

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.140
find the bugs because due to the fact that the lots is dependent on the data

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.820
and we don't have that data and we can't have that data is found in the

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.060
production by them and they have to report to their representative.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.140
He has to do quite a lot of checking and then, you know, it has to go to our

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.660
support, our support is reserving the issue.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.140
So my proposition was to change an approach.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.780
Let's look into, you know, improving our logs to create some alerts.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.780
So when we see some suspicious situation in production.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.460
So our customer support will know about it before the customer representative

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.620
even will know about it.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.540
And maybe we even be able to go with it so fast that they will be able to fix it

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.380
before anybody contacts us.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.480
Interesting.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.240
Interesting.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:50.640
Yeah.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.040
We will see how it will work out because you know, um, I was introduced to

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.200
the project last week and the project is starting in the Monday.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.320
So we will see how it goes.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.560
But so far I was talking with the architect and he says that it's quite

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.160
possible to fix the logs because right now the information is that in them

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.680
are not enough to even reconstruct the situation to see what happened.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.760
So, you know, there is a lot of discussion.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.320
So what did you do?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.280
What happened?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.600
That's etc, etc.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.080
So, you know, shorten the feedback loop by making the logs better.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.520
The whole situation can be resolved faster, which means the client would

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.320
be able to make more money and it means customer would be happy, which

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.760
means he will stay with us and we can make more money because our support

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.520
instead of the fixing the issue in let's say five hours, they can fix

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.920
it probably maybe our.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.500
That sounds like principle number one, your, uh, your priorities

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.420
improving the business.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.540
Exactly.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.790
Nice.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.430
Do you have other examples of how you've got teams to adopt modern

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.350
testing or?

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.270
This is maybe not exactly modern testing, but something very connected.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.350
Uh, I am community leader of the test automation in the objectivity

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.230
company I work for, which means I have a lot of contact with testers

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.950
that wants to learn automation.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:19.230
And what I am trying to show them is learn how to code this ability

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.870
will be helpful for you in much more aspects.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.580
You can write some small programs that will help you with your testing

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.420
will enhance your testing will, will allow you for the faster feedback.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.580
We allow you to better communicate with developers to better understand

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.980
what's going there and make you pretty much more productive.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.460
The automation, the end to end tests is not a way to go, especially

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.980
that I agree with you that in my opinion, this is the stuff that

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.180
should sooner or later go back completely to developers because let's

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.100
be honest, this is the hardest code that you will ever write.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.780
Yeah, I've made that comment before.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.500
In fact, there was, uh, and I'm going to, we're going to dive in here a little bit,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.220
but I remember talking to, when I was writing a chapter in, I was asked to

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.820
write a chapter in Dorothy Graham's book, experiences and test automation.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:18.380
And I am always of the camp that focusing on writing automation is the wrong goal.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.460
You're trying to make it easier to do your job well and automation can help

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.820
there, but that's, that's what it does.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.500
And the story I wrote, I was interviewing a former tester who was an architect

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.140
on the windows team at Microsoft.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.100
And he talked about a, um, sort of a mock driver framework.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.820
They wrote that allowed companies like Intel and these people making

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.020
hardware that was going to be available, uh, much after the release of the OS,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.340
uh, being able to test that hardware through a pretty sophisticated

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.700
mock driver framework.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.580
I forget what it was called time was escaped me,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.180
but that was a good example of accelerating the achievement of a book

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.500
quality and it's just much more valuable.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.340
My experience has been writing tools to help me test has been much more valuable

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.180
and serendipitously to this conversation.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.960
I just, I, I saw a few more tweets this weekend about testers

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.720
focusing on automation and that's so weird testers.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.720
It's odd to me.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.360
It's not big.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.640
You look at the state of the industry.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.040
It's not odd, but testers, as you've seen, they go, Oh, I want to make

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.400
themselves more valuable.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.000
I want to learn automation.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.790
And what they really want to do is they want to make themselves more valuable.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.600
And there's a, they're focusing on the wrong goal.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.580
I'm to be honest, I'm not entirely sure because from perspective of value

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.060
for the customer, I agree with you, but we are also in the let's

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.540
call it corporate world when you are just a number in the table.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.740
And let's say, let's be honest, having that automation in front of your

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.460
title quite often means you earn much more money.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.500
It doesn't matter that probably as you know, manual tester of human tester,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.300
you are much better.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:08.340
You can do much more, but for the payer, you are just the number and you

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:14.680
may hit the glass ceiling very far, very fast for the tester, but you

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.340
know, this is the problem of the industry that also needs to be

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.680
tackled sooner or later.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.960
Yes.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.620
Any other examples of applying modern testing principles in your, in your

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.740
roles and actually answer that question and doing that, I'm not exactly

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.660
sure what your role is.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.500
Sounds like you're in a sort of a consultant role, but I'd like to

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.500
hear more about what your, what your day to day job is.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.540
My title is simple.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:47.940
I am senior automation quality engineer at objectivity, but my role is,

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.060
I would say automation expert.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.500
It would be the easiest way to describe.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.220
I am responsible for this automation community in the company.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.260
So I am responsible for helping with their equipment, with sharing

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.620
knowledge, with trainings, and I am also, you know, expert.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.540
So when there is some situation that requires someone much more knowledgeable,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.780
I am the one that is called for to, you know, to help preserve the situation.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.780
We, for example, had a situation when we were passed the, you know, asking

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.980
question if we should be doing, but if we were in the point, we have to do it.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.940
Basically there was platform that we couldn't do performance testing using

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.860
the JMeter or the gut link because the like was, they were messed up and we

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.300
had to do something that is completely against the books, you know, use

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.180
Selenium for the performance test, but actually it wasn't completely

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.020
another option. And for example, I was the one that has to design some

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.180
solution, how we can even tackle this problem.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.660
I was screaming in my heart that I have that we are in situation when we

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.420
have to do it, but you know, client needs some information about how

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.980
the application is performing and we haven't another option to provide

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.940
him that information.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.880
Cool. Cool. Before we go on, but were there any other examples of

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.320
modern testing worth sharing today?

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.340
To be honest, I think for now we can stop with this because I haven't

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.300
answered the first part of your question, which I can't remember.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.620
That's right. Which was how have you seen modern testing work in

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.380
software houses?

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.500
Some success stories.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.650
To be honest, this is the place when I see the most problem, because

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.890
when I look at the DevOps, when I look at the software houses, the

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.890
problem is the DevOps, even if you read the Phonics project, they are

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.290
saying that the most core business you should keep in hand, you

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:49.810
should keep at your site so you can develop fast, you can release

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.210
it to production often.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.330
And this is the problem I see, because usually when you outsource

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.970
something, you need to have some kind of contract, some kind of

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:05.290
working with the organization to be able to, you know, to have to

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.050
trust them.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.050
And usually most software houses I see are not at this level of

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.490
trust, because they are either working in the bottle using

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.610
model, in which case, you know, they don't care because all

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.250
management is on the side of the customer.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.450
But in case of time and material or fixed price, which are, I

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.010
think the two most popular models, there is the problem how

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.410
to actually implement properly DevOps, because you are still

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:36.010
you still are very dependent on the customer and how they are

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.530
willing to trust you with, you know, the access to production,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.610
that kind of stuff.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.730
And it's additional barrier that needs to be broken.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.330
I essentially read that there is another model of cooperation with

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.290
the customers, which is called, I may, I may screw it up.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.450
I think it's outcome based model when customer is basically paying

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.370
depending on the outcomes that you are achieving.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:03.210
And I think this is the only way for the software house system

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:09.170
forward to be able to work in the DevOps and hands also apply

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.730
mother testing principles, because we need to build that trust.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.530
And I think that's the point of the first principle, we have to

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.370
improve business.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.410
And when we improve the business, we are able to build the

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.650
trust, you know, to be able to even improve the business even

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.610
more due to the other principles.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.040
Thank you for that.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.440
In that you mentioned the Phoenix project.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.040
And I know from our conversation that you recently read the

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.680
unicorn project still on my list.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.560
Uh, tell me just curious on your take on that and what would be

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.840
the interest of that, of that book for people who are

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.080
listeners of this podcast.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.120
And to end the preface, while you think about that Phoenix

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.240
project is all about the theory of constraints, which is a big

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.920
part of accelerating the achievement of customer quality or customer

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.320
value.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.000
So I'm curious where the unicorn project takes over and what sort

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
of the main lesson and gist of that book is.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.040
That would be quite a tangent because I must admit, I don't

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.680
like this book.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.720
I read it and I think this is still got a book, but it's the

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.880
weakest book about the DevOps from Gen Kim Eats.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.480
It has its problem.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.240
Uh, I think for starter, we need to start with the goal

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.800
because Dr.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.760
Goldratt, one of his ideas for the goal was to share that

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:36.200
stories are good material to even about hard concepts in the

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.480
management of other stuff.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.440
And the phonics project took much of that.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:47.000
It completely ran with the idea of the, uh, story as the

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.160
method of presenting the information.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.520
Unicorn project is also making the same way.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.600
It's also the story.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.520
And here is the problem.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.920
The book starts with disclaimer that you have to leave your

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.760
so that you will have to use your suspension of disbelief.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.830
And this is the big problem for me because at this point you

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.310
are basically saying you screwed up as the storyteller that you

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.870
need me to completely use my suspension of disbelief because

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.630
the book is happening at the same time as the unicorn

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.150
project.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.150
It's, I would say as the unicorn as phonics project is

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.750
about the bridge crew with the managers and how they are

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.150
dealing with the situation.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.910
The unicorn is about the, as they calling here, red shirts,

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.630
the normal people down in the system, the teams that are

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.390
actually dealing with the problems.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.900
And here I have quite a lot of problems because, uh, the

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.580
model I'm trying to look at the characters.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.860
I see, for example, the time is completely made from the

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.300
rubber because I cannot imagine how the original characters

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.700
would have also time to participate in this events.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.110
And I think my biggest issue is I cannot say for whom is that

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.710
book, because at first I thought it's the book for the, you

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.710
know, for the laggards, for the late majority, for the

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.350
developers, how they can learn about new technologies and

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.470
how to use them.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.910
Because basically every popular technology right now,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:20.790
Kubernetes, Docker, et cetera, is named and explained in

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.190
the book.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.830
So it's kind of seemed to me like it was addressed to

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.550
those people.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.710
But then I came back, can see it because those people

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.830
won't probably have contact with this book since they

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.910
are in the laggards, they are still quite far away from

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:35.710
the DevOps.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.580
And even if they hear about DevOps, probably they will

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.180
hear about the other books first.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.950
And my problem is also what this book tries to teach

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:50.230
because the only worth, I think, that was the how

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.950
it called the five ideas for them of the work.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.670
And the ideas itself were great.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.910
Oh, yeah, local localities simplicity, that was one focus

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.670
flow and joy was the second.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.910
Third was improvement of daily work for was

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.910
psychological safety and five was customer focus, which

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.830
the five is very similar to first principle of the

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.590
modern testing.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.380
And they were a great idea, but the way they were

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.660
introduced in this book, there was too much noise

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.460
to actually see them in the work.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.020
The authors were tried to put them in the spotlight.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.940
But I kind of didn't feel like the spotlight was put

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.780
on them properly.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:37.060
I'm still building my my final opinion of the book as

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.620
I'm writing the review for it.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.660
But at this point, I cannot say for whom I would

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.620
recommend that book.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.420
I don't see, you know, the targeted audience for it.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.740
Fair enough.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.740
It's something I think because I like business fables,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.740
I've read all the Lynch, Yoni books and the Phoenix

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.340
Project and the goal, of course, I liked actually I

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.580
like the goal the best because it wasn't about

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.180
software.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.050
Yes, I agree.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.530
Because I could I could form the metaphors and the

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.770
patterns myself.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.210
And I think that makes it a lot easier to adopt.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:12.010
Plus, I was listening to go recently as the audio

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.210
book. And what was impressive for me, it was

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.530
proper audio play.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.570
I think there was something like 12 voice actors

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.810
there and white array of sounds.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.850
So it was a joy to even listen to it.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.130
It was treated as the proper audio play.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.930
And that was also interesting.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.170
I've never had an audio book experience like that.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.650
So I might have to check that one out just so I

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.250
can I think it sounds great.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.690
So it's like, yeah, I do a plan, especially when you

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.210
hear the doctor, how it was just what, John,

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.410
and he's speaking with heavy accent.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.250
He's really just showing to listen to him.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.930
I'm going to check that out.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.410
I'm going to definitely check that out.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.530
One last question while we're kind of on and

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.250
thank you for that.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.050
I'm like I said, I'm still going to read it.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.170
But yeah, I want to form my own opinion.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.970
But I think it's I was a little worried about it

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.090
earlier on. But I will form my own opinion and

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.330
probably share it on the podcast.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.170
Yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinion

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:09.690
about it.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.650
All right. One last question for today.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.090
And I'm going to give you an option to rant a

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.490
little bit and I'll probably join in.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.170
But you had mentioned to me on Slack that you

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.330
read an article in Polish today on the state of

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.730
testing. And can you talk about what you read

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.850
there and your reaction and we can both I'll

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.690
help you tie it into modern testing if and where

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:28.010
needed.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.330
Yeah, basically, there was an article called State

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.210
of the Testing.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:38.530
And I started reading the article and basically it

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.330
was about testers, testers, testers, testers,

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.530
testers, and even more.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.090
It was about traditional testers.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.370
Then it starts going into different things that

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.610
are happening in the market.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:55.530
Outer himself is stating that the market is not

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.570
satisfied with traditional testers and they are

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.930
doing other things like monitoring DevOps and

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.690
this whole little of things which I could see

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.490
their testing.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.610
And he said that the testers are staying behind.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.970
And he ended basically his essay with saying that

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.930
testing is in the defensive right now, which

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.850
kind of triggered me because looking at even

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.850
things that he has mentioned from my perspective,

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.290
adding to it even the test of smother testing, I

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.530
think testing wasn't ever better than it's now.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.610
The teams see the value of actual testing.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.450
The teams are going forward with quality.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.530
What I'm seeing is that actually the traditional

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.170
testing is in the defensive.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.890
And as I've already said, the fact that he put

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.130
equality mark between tester and testing was the

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.890
thing that pissed me off the most.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.090
And you know what Brenton I say and more and

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.490
more and I have to continue a little Twitter

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.010
battle after our talk here today, but I'm

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.530
caring less and less about testing and more

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.490
and more about quality.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.450
Testing is one method to reduce risk.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.250
That's a very good method and good testing

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.090
reduces a lot of risk, but it's not the only way

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.450
to reduce risk and improve the business.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.370
Exactly.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.450
Yeah, this is something I'm kind of mentally not

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.970
ready because I'm still putting the equality mark

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.210
when it's not between quality and testing.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.170
I'm trying to disconnect this, but you know,

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.570
the years of the training makes it hard to

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.570
remove that quality mark there, but I am

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.410
seeing it as less connected lately.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.250
I agree about you can achieve quality.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.450
When we talk about accelerating the

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.010
achievement of a more quality, it's

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.810
definitely, I'm figuring out more and more.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.690
Brenton, I've been saying that phrase for

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.330
years.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.450
I think Brent just reposted his blog post

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.570
re-coin that phrase maybe 10 years ago.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.890
Over time, I'm realizing more and more

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.090
what that means is less about testing, more

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.250
about the other ways to reduce risk.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.690
And you look at testing and testability

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.730
are one way and the traditional way we did

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.890
it when we were shipping things every

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.290
couple of years, but operability and the

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.250
ability to deploy safely and monitor and

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.560
learn are just as big, if not more,

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.800
actually more important, I would

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.200
argue, in some businesses.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.440
Yeah.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.000
Plus the thing that was actually in the goal,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.650
because one of them, well, that will be

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.250
a mouthful, the goals of the goal was not

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.450
only to present the theory of

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.530
constraint and show how the stories can

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.610
be used as teaching method, but the

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.090
culture also wanted to show people that

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.770
the science is not only what the

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.530
scientists are doing, that everybody can

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.170
experiment, every can learn from the

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:42.970
experiments.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.690
And here is the R-set value.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.490
We, you don't have to be tested to

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.010
experiment and to check the results of

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.930
these experiments.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.970
And lots of quality is coming from that

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.130
fast experimentation.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.250
Yes.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:57.810
Yes.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.290
I love it.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:58.690
I love it.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.090
I love it.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.470
All right.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.670
Well, that's, that's it for today.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.550
So any, actually before we finish any

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.470
blog sites or Twitter handles or anything

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:10.870
else you'd like to share with listeners?

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.230
Yeah, I am on the blog.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.550
I'll talk on the blog on the Twitter as

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.430
much ever attack.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.790
I have blog called the broken test where

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.430
I recently went on quite a long essay

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.870
around for dedicated for the people that

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.350
wants to go into the testing where I'm

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.390
talking about different myths connected

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.830
to that because I'm thinking that we are

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.830
sending too much snake or to them lately.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:35.070
Yeah.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.350
And, uh, I nodded my head so hard.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.430
I almost hit the microphone.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.050
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:44.490
And, um, basically I am lately happy.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.090
You can see me on a lot of

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.370
conferences in Europe.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.010
I am, my plan for the next year is to

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.730
finally tackle the West of Europe

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.930
because on the East I have no problem

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.370
of getting into the conferences on the

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.450
West, I have a little problem.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.410
And again, I will try to go with some

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.170
subject topics connected to more than

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.970
testing on our sub developer conferences.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.010
We'll see how it will go.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.290
Sounds awesome.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.490
Let me know if I can help at all.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.010
Try and grease some wheels somewhere.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.690
If I know the people.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.720
Yeah, I would probably ask the free

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.560
way to help with the, um,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.160
abstracts for the call for papers.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.760
But today I am lazy and I'm not

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.440
writing and I will be doing something

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.240
tomorrow.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.960
Well, thank you, Mashi.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.600
It's been fantastic talking to you today.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.520
I know we both have to go take our dogs

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.920
for a walk, so I'll try and edit out

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.440
mine crying in the background earlier.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.120
I'm sure that'll work out.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.440
All right.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.960
I don't know if you could hear that or not.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.840
She had a little wine.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.400
Hey, okay.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.400
Okay.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.640
Good.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.160
Good.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.920
We'll see what happens.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.480
All right.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.240
Thank you again.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.000
Have a wonderful rest of your weekend

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.800
and, uh, we'll talk again soon.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.920
Thank you for having me here.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.360
Bye.
