00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.460
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.310
Now, on with the show.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.830
And we're back.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.310
Hey, Brent.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.310
Yes, we are.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.950
Hey, man.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.990
It seems like it's been forever.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.990
It has been.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.550
You know, life happens and we slow down.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.210
You get what you pay for with the A.B.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.210
Testing Podcast.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.210
How much does it cost, Brent?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
Zero.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.530
Our business model is wrong.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.250
No, we don't do this for the money.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.250
We don't do it for the fame.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.540
In fact, I don't know if I've mentioned this on air.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.660
I don't recall how much I've mentioned it to you, Brent.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.220
But did you know the A.B.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.180
Testing Podcast is an LLC?

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.540
I did not.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.540
I forgot I haven't told you this for the last three or four months.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.540
A.B.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.380
Testing is its own entity with its own tax number.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.900
We have our own bank account.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.380
And all of the proceeds I get from things that were born in modern testing, which is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.600
basically every conference talk I give, the Ministry of Test, modern testing course, etc.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.760
All that goes into the bank account, which I use then to pay for hosting and other random

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.760
shit.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.700
I think it's not a lot of money in there, but as it builds up and as God, it's been a long

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
year.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.820
As this COVID year ends and the next COVID year begins, somewhere at the end, there'll be

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.740
conferences that people go to.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.580
I thought it would be cool if we could do scholarships for those, things like that,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.500
do some sponsorships, give back to the community that has supported us for so long.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500
That's my plan with that.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
But yeah, we're an LLC.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.660
I have a checking account and I make sure that any billing I do for any proceeds go into

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.580
that and then I spend money out of that for the podcast, what I just said.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.720
So yeah, how did we get there?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
How you been, man?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.120
I've been okay.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:19.460
I'm finding the potentially up and coming constitutional crisis interesting.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.780
Oh, we're going to talk about that.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420
You know why?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.890
Because this is the last podcast we are going to do in 2020.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.170
If you're a listener and you'd like to be on an ABT 343, which I haven't done in a while

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.810
because I've been very busy, I will have some time in the rest of the month.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.930
Ping me and maybe we can get something set up.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.770
But yeah, this is our end of year 2020 recap looking forward.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.090
We're going to go over our predictions from last year.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.650
We're going to talk about some things interesting from this year besides COVID.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.090
I should say including COVID and we'll talk about some things we're expecting to see next

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.090
year.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.970
So yeah, that's our plan for today.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.490
All right, then I don't know if we should go.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.930
Well, before we go into what we predicted, we all know what we hated about 2020.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.930
Yeah.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.930
Yeah.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.930
What's going on?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.050
And by the way, it's interesting.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.610
This is episode 131.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.250
And the last one we did was just before the election.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.250
It was.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.530
It was election production episode.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.000
You were wrong and right.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.920
You predicted, we'll go into predictions and then we'll go back to my original, a cup one

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.680
prediction and then we'll go back to my original agenda here.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.240
You predicted Trump would win and the country would burn.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.000
Trump lost and the country is burning.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.910
So as far as I am aware, maybe you.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.500
Stay close to the microphone, Brent.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.460
Maybe you are more aware than I have, but as far as I'm aware, all states have not yet

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.980
certified most states.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.980
Actually all states, I believe have certified.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.980
I don't know.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.260
So the news I had as of yesterday, it said had not yet occurred.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.660
The electorates don't vote for another week and a half.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.660
December 14th.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.460
But the elections, as far as I know, were all to be certified by the end of November.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.900
There is a path.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.500
There is a path where my prediction holds true.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500
Would you like to hear it?

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.700
I can go read it on any conspiracy website.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.700
I'm sure.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.900
No, the path is essentially if all states failed to certify, there is a path where that

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.250
escalates to the house.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:49.260
And the house then votes on the president, but they vote like the Senate.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.300
In other words, the house, each state gets one vote.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.380
And if that happens, the red states outnumbered the blue states.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.140
They do.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.140
Trump wins.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.460
That would be hilarious.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.900
And there would be there.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.900
And you'd still be right.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.900
The country would burn.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.500
Oh, it would even burn hotter than it would have if he had one on the election day.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.500
Right.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.740
Because there's going to be all those people who, like, as you just stated, claim claiming

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.740
he lost and suddenly had the way he did lose.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.380
Yes, we could break apart what little remains of what we call democracy in our country and

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.940
have him win.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.340
But he lost regardless of what happens on a technicality, which is a long shot.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.340
He lost.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.260
Well, I lost by a lot.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Yeah.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.860
Certainly, he has not shown himself to be particularly presidential since the election.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.100
He hasn't shown himself to be presidential for the last four years.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.100
He's been exceptionally poor in the last four weeks.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.580
Yes, agreed.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.580
OK.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.580
Yeah.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.420
Anyway, I've said my say on that.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.420
All right.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.940
We're not recording, but I'm sipping on a lovely Costco cold brew coffee.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.180
I've almost not gone to a store since the pandemic began.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.700
I've probably been inside of a grocery store three or four times since March.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.680
I have become an Instacart patron.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.560
They bring me nice things and I tip the drivers nicely.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.960
It works out well.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.320
But I got a little Costco run delivered yesterday.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.160
I joined Costco for the first time ever in 2020.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.760
How about that for an accomplishment?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.520
Yeah, it's interesting because I have been using Costco less and less.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.590
But for the first time in over a year, I actually got a Costco delivery yesterday.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.310
Oh, that's what my game was yesterday.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.310
Wow.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.590
Aren't we close and tight now?

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.590
We are.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.590
We are.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.590
We both get Costco things.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.670
Before I go recap our predictions from our 2019 show, if you'd like to pause here, go

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.430
back and listen yourself.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.190
I think it was episode 119 or something.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.190
You can find it.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.270
I thought I would take some time to see if there's anything at all that you and I

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.830
can think of that we enjoyed about the year that will forever be known as 2020, the year

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.830
from hell.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.470
Books, movies, podcasts, articles, people, etc.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.810
What did you enjoy about 2020?

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.690
I do have two things.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:27.160
Number one, I have a bunch of new hires that came to my team and they were all based in

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.190
the East Coast of the United States.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:40.310
Because of the timeliness of COVID, I guess, they integrated rather well because basically

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.050
even the people who weren't remote were now remote.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.400
So that was nice.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.480
It's rare for me to have within a few months of a new hire, people reaching out and going,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.760
oh my God, this guy's fantastic, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.520
It was a great level setting, I guess.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.840
Now everyone to be on the same level.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840
That was nice.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:15.390
The other thing I would say is a podcast that I have found is really helping me be a solid

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.890
distraction as well as empathetic.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:25.130
I don't know if you recall, super popular show about 15 years ago called Scrubs.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.530
I know that show, yeah.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.170
Has it been that long?

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.170
God, I'm old.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.170
Yeah, it's been a while.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.170
I am old, by the way.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.170
I had a birthday yesterday.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.650
Oh, and yes, you did.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.050
And I actually noted to...

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.330
Pass me about that.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.890
I was going to say, congrats to you.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.370
I am officially reaching geriatric levels of age.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.070
Remind myself, I think you're what, two years older, three?

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.070
I don't know.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.390
How old are you?

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.390
I turned 51 in March.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.110
Yeah, I'm four years older than you.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.060
I just hit the double nickels.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.660
Oh, so if you were still here at Microsoft, you...

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.580
I could retire and keep all my stock.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.580
You're right.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.620
You now hit the immediate vest.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.980
Yes, yes.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.220
I could not have made it that long.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.220
I would not have made it.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.290
I'd be dead.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.290
But anyway, go on.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.410
This podcast, Scrubs, go on.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:19.930
Yeah, the name of the podcast is Fake Doctors Real Friends.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.850
And it's hosted by the two main characters from Scrubs.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.490
Donald Faison and Zach Braff.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:35.370
And they're basically going back and rewatching the Scrubs shows and sort of doing random commentary

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.650
that they have.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.890
But for the most part, they go off tangent.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:45.650
I smile every time they do that because I'm like, ah, it's not just me and Alan.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.010
But it's amusing.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.810
It's got a good deal of background information about the show, which I loved.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:58.730
It's got a good deal of empathy and compassion, a good deal of sort of venting and frustration.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:05.970
And to me, it's been soothing and helpful in some regards because you got these two guys

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.370
who's out there making it very clear.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:17.050
They're feeling different versions of exactly the same bullshit pain I am.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.170
So that's been a little gem for me.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.140
Fake Doctors Real Friends.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.140
Very cool.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.860
I'm going to share a couple podcasts that have joined my high rotation in 2020.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:36.180
The first one is, of course, I'm a big Pat Lincione fan, Lincione, author of Five Dysfunctions

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.220
of a Team, but I've read everything he's ever written.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:47.740
He has a podcast talking about one thing I want to go into, into 2021 episode is his new

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.660
concept hasn't even written a book about it, but it's very similar to Strengthfinders.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.500
It's the six types of genius.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.500
And it's really just talking about what are, I don't want to go deeply into it.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.300
I mentioned it in a five for Friday, a few weeks ago.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.300
It is fascinating.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.660
I'd love to dive into that sometime.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.100
That was heard that for the first time on his podcast.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.260
The other one, there's just incredible storytelling.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.660
And in fact, I'm going to tell a little bit.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.980
Now I don't want to go into it, but take the whole story.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:24.040
So it's called Cautionary Tales, and it is just fascinating storytelling about one that

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.520
was just fantastic.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.480
Bowie Jazz and the Unplayable Piano.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.840
And it's good at winding these stories together, but the story here is I don't want to give

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.600
it away, but it's really about the main story that they start and end with with some weaving

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:44.480
is about a concert that Keith Jarrett played jazz piano player played in Germany.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.200
Really famous recording came out of that and just kind of how it came to be, which is

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.000
a massive fluke.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.720
I spend a lot of my time thinking about how complex systems fail and or really how complex

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720
systems work.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.480
And it just brings a lot of sort of meta insight into that sort of thing.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.760
So that's another of my favorites that I'd recommend from 2020.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.480
What was the name again?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480
Cautionary Tales.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.580
Okay.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.020
It is most excellent.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.220
Highly recommend it.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.740
I binged it a few weekends ago and went through about a half a dozen episodes.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.380
I have more to do.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.220
And that's all I mentioned for my podcast.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.220
Movie wise.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.440
Oh, did you watch the Queen's Gambit on Netflix?

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.440
No.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.440
I thought it was excellent.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.640
It made me want to play chess again.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.340
And then I remembered, oh yeah, I suck at chess.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.660
Well it depends on who you play, right?

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.660
Right, it sure does.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.660
Right.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.940
Play a five year old and you'll go, yeah, chess.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.940
It depends on the five year old.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.010
Right.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.330
Well, that's true.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.330
Play your puppy.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.330
There you go.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:58.210
I was thinking through, I think the only, I think I have only watched one movie.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.470
No, that's false.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.070
I watched two movies this year.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:15.230
One it was the new Pixar movie with the two boys who are trying to, one of them learns

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.870
sorcery and tries to summon his dad.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.870
Oh yeah.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.870
Yeah.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.870
I saw that.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.870
What was that called?

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.070
I feel like it has the word close in the title.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.100
It was funny.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.100
Yeah.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.100
I saw that one.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.100
And then I also.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.620
They're yelling the name out right now.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.020
They are.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.390
And then the other one I saw was a rewatch.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:47.870
So one of the things that I have been doing to keep myself sane is NHK world news.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:56.190
It's a news channel broadcasting from Tokyo, but it's all in English and they do a lot

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.990
of, you know, every hour on the hour, they do some news and then they have a bunch of

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.590
little sort of cultural shows.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:07.230
And I've been kind of using that to to sort of fake.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.190
Hey, I'm actually traveling this year.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.270
I'm actually, you know, doing things and seeing stuff and in others.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.910
They said that sort of fill that that empty void.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:28.370
The in as part of that, I suddenly early on, I suddenly had an inkling to go back and

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.280
rewatch the made for TV movie Shogun.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280
Oh my God.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.800
I remember that from a gazillion years ago in 1984.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.000
It was well worth it.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.680
That was such a well done movie.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.240
So yeah, I enjoyed that.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.880
Right now on on the streaming medias.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:01.120
We recently signed up for Disney Plus and I got the bundle package.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.240
So I now have Netflix, Amazon, Prime Video.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.360
I have Disney Plus.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:14.880
I have HBO Max and Hulu.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.600
And I've had way too many of these things for the amount of time I can spend watching.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.400
Yeah, I ended up dropping HBO Max.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:27.180
I have the I have the Hulu Disney, Hulu Disney ESPN package.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.100
I haven't started watching Mandalorian yet.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.380
My son's coming to visit and I figured he and I could start watching it together.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:43.500
But on HBO Max, Doom Patrol has captured a great deal of my attention for a for a DC

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.660
universe thing.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.820
I'm finding that well done.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.980
They also have Teen Titans there that I haven't started yet.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.860
But it's definitely made for adults.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:00.940
I did pick up CBS All Access because I want to catch up on all of the Star Trek Discovery

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.420
and the Picard series.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:08.260
And also mainly I picked it up because they're doing yet another remake of The Stand, which

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.040
is one of my favorite books.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.160
So an original mini series they did on it was just absolutely awful.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.900
So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.700
Yeah, so yeah, that's well, I'll take some time over winter and I'll do a lot of watching

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.980
of the videos, I guess, and playing of the video games.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:34.260
What I want to do next is reflect on our predictions for 2020 before we go into what

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.100
we think may happen in 2021.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100
And I'll just go one by one.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.980
You have a lot here.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.700
OK, so the first one is actually interesting because we already talked about it.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:51.690
Your first prediction from one year ago was that Trump would be reelected.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.370
And we already had that discussion.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.570
So I'll go on.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.010
Not yet false.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.250
Not yet false, but false and I hopefully false.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:03.090
The other one that you predicted was the rise of AIOps.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.090
How's that coming along?

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:10.610
Yeah, it's I'll go ahead and say that that's a failed prediction.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.570
It's funny because it's close to one of my predictions for 2021.

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.490
So put a pin in that.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.690
We'll come back to it in a bit.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:20.410
So Covid put a non-trivial distraction, I think, on a lot of these things.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:29.250
So AIOps is actually more prevalent than last year.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.130
But is it?

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:37.580
My prediction was intended to say it's going to be like fad worthy term.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.370
And that's clearly false.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.130
All right.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:41.690
Yeah.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.330
The next one was interesting.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.090
We can probably talk about it for a moment because it's maybe not quite.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.210
But I'll just read and see what you say.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.850
One talk per major test conference on or about modern testing,

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.730
perhaps by people not even on our radar.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.690
I think the first part is false, but the second part is certainly true.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.250
Yeah.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.170
And the first part is arguably true, depending

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.010
on your definition of major test conference.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.250
So a lot of test conferences have had people talk about modern testing.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.530
I don't know that Star has, but I think many of the other conferences have.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.450
It's been interesting.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:26.640
And also the rise of people that we don't know about talking about modern testing.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.560
Yeah, that has happened.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.600
I find that absolutely fascinating.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.320
And here, I'm not excluding the folks that we do know about around people

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:43.640
we don't know about talking about modern testing in order to knock it down.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:49.300
I'm talking about supporters of it.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.580
Yeah, so Star has.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.180
I just did a search Star East.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.740
For example, there was a talk, Timeless Testing Skills for Modern Testing,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.500
Critical Test Strategies for the Modern Testing World.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.820
At least, I don't know what the content of these.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.180
I stand corrected.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.980
I don't know what the content of those presentations were,

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.160
but at least the name is there.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.320
All right, and going on, I did make a joke about the convergence of modern testing

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.480
in AI ops, but that never happened.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.480
So it's OK.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.560
That was a joke.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.840
But then the next thing is something I wish would have happened.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.200
And I think should happen, but has not happened yet.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.460
You said observability will kill testability.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.700
Yeah, that has not.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.820
I don't think that is universally happened yet.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.580
No, that's that's one where.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.820
We need to help with that.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.620
Put that on the 2021 to do list.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:55.000
That's that's one where I wonder if if Joe has an insight on a Joel.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.080
Who the hell is Joe?

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.360
Joel Taylor Swift's boyfriend, Joe.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.240
Yeah, different.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.160
Joe, it might be.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.000
I don't know.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.240
OK, speaking of speaking of Tay Tay.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.720
Yeah.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.960
How are your guitar lessons going?

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.790
Yeah, that was another prediction that you would start guitar lessons.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:23.070
Yeah, so that went out the window when I screwed my finger.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.830
Oh, that's right.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:25.230
Right.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:32.550
And by the way, for the streaming users who are not there,

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.150
my finger still ain't fixed.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.070
I may be going back for another surgery.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.900
Yay.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.260
Yeah, your camera's on anyway.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.460
I can't see your picture.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.420
My camera's not on.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.620
No, I is the stupid.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.780
Oh, there it is.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.980
All right.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.740
I thought maybe you hadn't put your makeup on or something.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.900
No, yeah.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.180
Yeah, so that hasn't happened.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:56.940
That's OK.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.500
I have been playing my guitar more because I get bored,

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.620
but you can't see it's off camera.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.140
It's on my other camera.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.740
But we'll go on.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.860
And then your last one was you don't recall any of these, do you?

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.260
You said your beloved 49ers, that's

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.770
an American football team, would win the Super Bowl.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.330
They did not.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.060
They did win to it.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.420
The game was close, but they did not win.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.730
And they will absolutely not be at risk of winning this year.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.970
I was going to say.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.010
All right.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.050
So that wrapped up your predictions.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.130
I had a few as well last year.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.530
The first one I said, I will speak at exactly one conference.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.690
I did not go to any conferences, but I

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.050
ended up doing technically the only conference.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.610
No, that's not even true at all.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.290
I did Test Bash Home.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.690
I did a webinar for Test Craft.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.690
And I just this last weekend had a recording presented

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.490
at the Test Flix conference.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.810
Little eight minute talk.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:07.110
So I didn't go to any conferences, but I presented.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.190
And with a caveat, I thought my one conference presentation

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.070
would be a dev or a DevOps conference.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.870
That did not happen.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.510
I spoke all at, technically, at two test conferences.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.830
So we'll look forward in a minute.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.990
I said that the Sounders would make the playoffs

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.030
the 12th straight year.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.310
And they did, but would lose in the conference championship.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.910
Due to COVID, the conference championship

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:30.870
has not happened yet.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.710
It is on Monday.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.990
So we'll see how close I am there.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.030
And I said they would make the CCL final.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.870
Again, if you're not an American soccer fan,

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.310
you won't know what any of this means.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.670
But they went out in the very first round of the CCL.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.510
So that didn't happen either.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.510
And I did predict that one year from now, which is today,

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.630
that I would still be in the same job.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.870
I'm in the same job, completely different role.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.190
My role has vastly, not that it was bad before,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.310
but it's vastly improved.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.550
Super happy with it.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.830
And those are my predictions.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.350
So a couple of them were softballs, sorry.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.070
But predicting things is hard, especially about the future.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.460
Amen.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.340
All right.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.300
For predictions from 2021, I don't

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.020
know if you had a chance to think of any,

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.740
or if you'd like me to start with my three

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.320
and see what you have to say after that.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.040
What do you think?

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:22.560
Any ideas?

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.040
Do you want to kick it off?

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:24.920
Yeah, you know what?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:32.160
Honestly, as you also know, that within the next hour,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.360
I'm going on vacation.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.960
So I did a really crappy job for the end of the episode.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.920
These can be our predictions.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.440
Yeah.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.920
My predictions are your predictions.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.760
Oh, fair enough.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.080
May a prediction say, that's a bastardization

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.320
of about 16 different languages.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.160
I'm sorry.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.470
Everyone in the world.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.270
I don't know.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.750
In terms of predictions, I'm more leaning towards hopes.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:03.780
Right now, I absolutely hope that whatever

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.580
happens in terms of the leadership of the United States

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:13.700
happens seamlessly without drama in January.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:21.860
I absolutely hope that the world gets

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.460
tired of this whole new normal conversation.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.020
I want us to go back to normal soon.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.140
I have a lot of hopes around.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.260
I don't know if you're aware.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.540
Did you know that there are now three separate vaccines that

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.180
have shown to have 90% plus efficacy?

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.700
Very much paying attention to that.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.220
And yeah.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:49.260
Yeah, in terms of the world, it would be, it'd just be,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.660
we need to get back.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.580
Yeah.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.500
Yeah.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.060
By the way, I just looked up while you were talking.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.700
You were right.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.500
I was wrong.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.740
Not all states have certified their elections yet.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.540
For some reason, I thought they certified by the end

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.500
of November.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.220
But California is the last state to certify the election,

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.940
which makes sense.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.060
It takes a lot longer to count there.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.300
They will certify on December 11, so next Friday.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.380
Washington, West Virginia, Texas, Oregon, and Connecticut

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.820
certified yesterday.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.140
Illinois will certify today.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.020
Only thing remaining is on Monday, New York, Tuesday,

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.100
Maryland, New Jersey, and Missouri.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.620
And on December 11, California will certify.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.030
And then that part hopefully will be done.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.030
And hopefully it will be.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.910
Hopefully it'll stick.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:36.350
Yeah.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.190
Yeah.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.950
All right.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.590
Going into your hope around, I mean, it's not your hope.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.590
It's just there is hope that it looks like the light

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.620
at the end of the tunnel.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.140
We can, the articles I've read, see not a complete return

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.540
to normalcy, but a beginning of return to normalcy

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.980
as early as this summer, which seems like a long time.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.900
But it's achievable.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.540
But that goes into my first prediction.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.780
I don't think I'm going to travel anywhere,

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.220
on an airplane at least, in 2021.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.220
I still don't think between me just being paranoid and things

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.520
moving along, and how well it's worked me working from home,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.510
I don't see any reason to travel for work in 2021.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:25.080
Now for sure, for sure, there's going to be a lot of that too,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.580
right?

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.290
Because there was a study I think I talked about a while ago

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.050
around internal to Microsoft.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.450
What they're finding is that a lot of ICs are going,

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.690
dude, I have never been more productive.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.810
ICs are individual contributors.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:50.450
Whereas managers are like, oh my god, I am pulling my hair out.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.970
We're dying in death by Zoom.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:54.450
Yeah.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:54.950
Yeah.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.680
It's a slow, painful death.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.290
It is.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.090
So you mentioned a magic word there,

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:10.510
which gave me a pause to go on a brief segue.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.850
I was going to say, if you don't mind, but I'm going to.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:17.530
So speaking of IC productivity, are you

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:21.650
able to offer a comment on your employer's new productivity

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.810
score that's available for their productivity and office

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.720
applications?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.680
What?

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.080
I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:37.520
So maybe a week ago at Ignite, actually, in October,

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.840
Microsoft previewed a slick new tool called Productivity Score.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.160
During the virtual presentation, a senior product manager

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.120
said the feature provides insights

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.600
that perform how work gets done by showing employers

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.640
how workers use Microsoft 365 services like Outlook Teams,

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.900
SharePoint, and OneDrive.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.060
So they're going to analyze how much email you're sending

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.660
and how much time you're in meetings

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.580
and with who to give you a productivity score.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.430
What do you all think about that?

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.150
Have you not seen this?

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.150
I posted it in general.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.070
I haven't been on the Slack group in a while,

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.190
but go in general and scroll up a couple pages.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.480
There's a little bit of a discussion on it.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.680
Yeah, I'm reading an article on Geek Choir.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.510
I'll just say, uh.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.510
Yeah.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.590
This can only end badly.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.170
There's no good reason.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:42.160
Yeah, to me, it feels like even if this thing was doing

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:48.440
something beneficial, to me, it feels like it's early

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:54.400
to release this on human society.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.680
One of the things that I'm seeing right now, for example,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.560
is a leaderboard with people's names.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:08.480
And as we know, Hawthorne's effect is very real.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.560
Oh, and I could game all this crap.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.240
So I could ask you, I know the answer,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.160
but would you feel that a productivity metric based

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.600
on how and how much your employers are using Office

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.800
apps would be a fair representation

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.400
of their productivity?

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.160
No, of course not.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.160
Would it be even close?

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.720
And here's a quote from someone within Microsoft, I think.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.680
I'm not going to mention the person's name,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.440
but the quote is, productivity score

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.600
produces a score for the organization

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.080
and was never designed to score individual users.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.000
Sure.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.400
Right, and that's a really.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.880
I'm sure it'll be used that way.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.680
Well, right, if you show individual users,

00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:03.000
but to me, I'm fairly certain that if I were to,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.080
if I would dive in this further and understand one or two more

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.520
facts on this, that I would conclude

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.960
this might have been an unethical release.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.240
It does smell funny.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:19.960
It does.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.200
It's gotten a lot of, I would encourage

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.840
you to continue to form your opinion on this

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.960
and let us know how it goes.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.200
It just seems like, what?

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.080
Yeah, it seems like an onion article, but it's not.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.880
Because I have two positive predictions,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.240
but I have one negative one first that,

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.000
and I'm afraid it's true as much as I don't want it to be.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.480
I think there's a lot of people that

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.400
are hoping with the transition to a president who

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.200
doesn't want to be in the news every day

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.600
that things will get back to normal in the US.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.160
But I believe the political climate in the US

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.440
is only going to get worse no matter what.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.280
Yeah.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.000
Given what's happened over the last four weeks,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.400
there's no graceful way to rise out of this.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.120
It's going to get worse, much, much worse

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.770
before it gets better.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.130
Yeah, sadly, I think that's true.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:09.970
We'll see what happens.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.330
I can be proven wrong, but that's my hunch.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.850
Two other predictions.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.330
One is going to, they're both going

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.970
to require some discussion.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:23.140
But one is 2021 will be the year

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.820
that I get Nicole Forsgren to join us

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.000
for an episode of A-B testing.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.440
Oh, OK.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.140
That'd be a fantastic win.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.410
I'm going to work on pulling that off.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.250
The other one is, and it's funny,

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.130
because I wrote this before I either I forgot or I

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.210
wasn't taking in mind your comment about the rise of AI

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.720
ops.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.440
But as I actually, I don't know if I mentioned this.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.640
I keep, I lose track.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.720
We don't talk for it very often.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.000
One of the things that's on my plate,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.800
you like how I almost gave away the prediction

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.120
that I thought I'd give some context to it?

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.520
One of the things on my plate, without going

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.160
into any details at all on our financials,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.920
is because I manage DevOps teams,

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.800
I am managing all of our infrastructure

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.840
across the company.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.280
One of the things on my plate is

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.720
to do whatever I can to reduce our service cost,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.560
our hosting cost, any cost, all of our spend

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.160
we use to make money.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.280
What I'm finding as I dig deeper into this

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.040
is there's actually a book on this which

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.640
puts it ahead of AI ops.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.440
But I find not a lot of people have heard of,

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.840
and maybe you have in your part of the world,

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.520
but 2021 will be the rise of FinOps.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.400
Have you heard of FinOps before?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:44.900
No.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.800
FinancialOps.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.760
It's people who specialize in analyzing

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.520
cloud spend, technology spend, and find optimization.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.480
We're at a stage now in our, I can say this much,

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.480
we don't have any huge low hanging fruit.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.480
It doesn't save a lot of money.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.080
We're going to have to find hundreds of ways

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.880
to save a little bit of money here and there.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.320
So I'm actually going to hire, I'm

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.320
going to attempt to hire a FinOps engineer in 2021.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.480
Because this role exists.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.280
There are job openings for other companies.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.320
There are FinOps.org I found.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.360
It's all about this.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.440
There's a book about maybe two or three books on FinOps.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.400
There's one most of them are dedicated to FinOps in AWS,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.400
which is interesting, but not as relevant to me as GCP.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.440
But anyway, I'm going to attempt to hire a FinOps

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:29.940
engineer.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.480
And that's not what's going to cause the overall industry

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.600
rise of this.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.200
I think it's just I'm riding the wave,

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.860
I think, of something that is going

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.840
to become much more huge in 2021.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.920
FinOps.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.240
Brett's still going, what is this word you told me?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.880
What are you talking about?

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.640
FinOps.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.680
I'm just like, where does that even come from?

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.920
It's a DevOps engineer who focuses on financials.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.600
Hey, podcast listeners, my dog says hello.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.920
Did you say Fin or Fin?

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.080
F-I-N-O-P-S.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.880
There is a thing called FinOps.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.520
It's a company, apparently.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520
So what, F-I-M?

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.480
It's a not fat skinny.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.440
Oh, FinOps.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:21.330
No, Fin, like financial operations.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.650
It's a dumb name, but it makes sense given.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:24.490
All right.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440
Sure.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.200
Why not?

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.200
Let's ops everything.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.590
Ops is the new .NET.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.870
It really is.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:40.150
And if you look at, because I pay attention to the DevOps

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:45.000
space, and actually one of the discussions we have on my org

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.280
is we have a DevOps team, and I have other teams that do things.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.160
And they're really DevOps.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.080
Really, none of them are DevOps, because DevOps is a culture.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.760
They're really just platforms, and infrastructure, and tools,

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.280
and I just give up on figuring out what to call them.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.400
But then I see a note from marketing.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.720
They're hiring someone for DevOps.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.760
And I'm like, what?

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.270
And it's like marketing for, I can't go into the details,

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.990
but all I'll say is anything that has anything to do

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:14.590
with developer workflow is now known as DevOps.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.150
And I find it appalling and disgusting, and I hate it.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.230
It just drives me frickin' batty.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.430
And the battle is long gone.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.370
I can't find it anymore.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:29.490
Oh, if I was good with editing, I'd go add this back

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.450
to the beginning, but I've been reading this book

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:33.890
called Seeking SRE.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.370
Great stories, great stories.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.290
I'm gonna, I don't have it here.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.040
I'm gonna read you something.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.160
Because I've been looking at, because I have SRE,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.440
I have DevOps, I have internal platforms,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.480
all the tools and systems we use

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.560
to build and deploy software.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:55.040
And I'm trying to slightly have an SRE team

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.480
who are doing a little bit too much incident management

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.720
and not enough SRE for me.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.200
And so I was trying to think what that,

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.240
and they're getting it now.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.480
We're well on our way to functioning,

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.320
like I think we should.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.960
But in reading this book, I found this quote

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.320
in this book, which is actually,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.170
I believe from the DevOps handbook,

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.090
but I wanted to read it to you, so get your thoughts.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.090
One could view DevOps as a generalization

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.170
of several core SRE principles

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.510
to a wider range of organizations,

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.740
management structures and personnel.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.780
One could equivalently view SRE

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.460
as a specific implementation of DevOps

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.120
with some idiosyncratic extensions.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.080
Or some specialties.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.400
Some specialization.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.240
I love that quote.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.920
Because it helped, for me in my org,

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.940
it helps explain, I try and explain to them

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.080
that really you're all doing things

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.220
that could be called DevOps.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.040
And they don't, they kind of get it,

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.520
but not everybody quite gets it,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.200
but it's all, everybody's working on helping

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.400
internal teams build, deliver, deploy,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.240
and maintain a high quality code.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.920
Yeah, I've always viewed DevOps

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.080
as sort of the umbrella term.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.640
Yeah, yeah, in fact, there is a rumor,

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.760
at least I don't see us corroborated anywhere

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.960
on the internet, but there's a rumor

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.600
that the reason Google named SRE

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.640
and camped with a team called SRE

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.750
is they didn't want to call the team DevOps.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.950
So they made up a new name.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.150
Okay, I wonder why.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.390
I mean, that's...

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.040
Because remember, DevOps is a culture,

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.320
not the name of an org.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.440
We lost that battle.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.680
It's all right.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.880
I say DevOps is a culture.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.960
We have a team called that

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.720
to help facilitate that culture in the organization.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.780
And my team very much lives that principle,

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.120
but keep in mind that I would say at this stage,

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.640
the majority of teams called DevOps in the world

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.650
actually think they do the DevOps,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.970
they're really operations orgs,

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.120
which is the antithesis of having DevOps.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:58.970
But how do we get there?

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.930
Okay, so those are all the predictions

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.730
I could think of for 2021, not going anywhere.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:04.890
Nicole's coming on the show.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.730
Nicole, if you're listening, you're welcome anytime.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:07.810
Just anytime.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:08.730
Anytime.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.730
Because we wanna talk all about your book

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:14.690
and I should pay attention to see what else

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:15.970
she has been up to.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.530
I did wish her a happy birthday yesterday

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.040
because she and I have the same birthday.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.370
Us and Ozzy Osbourne, those are the...

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.730
She and Ozzy Osbourne are the two people I know

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.490
with the same birthday as mine.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.730
Now you know, today I learned.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.730
Well, that's great.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.610
The last time we did the prediction,

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.570
like we didn't even, COVID wasn't even a hint.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.650
No, but it was a hint soon after.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:42.090
We began hearing about COVID, as you recall,

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.170
in late 2019.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:45.490
It was just after our recording.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.170
And man, it came on fast and it's not going away.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.520
Yeah, the...

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:55.670
I don't know.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.990
It definitely feels like...

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.710
I wonder, I wonder if the test...

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.550
I don't know.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.470
I wonder if anyone's done a study.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:12.470
Has the test industry...

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.510
How has the test industry been impacted by COVID?

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.350
If at all.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.990
I don't think it's changed at all.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.830
You don't?

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:19.830
You don't think...

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.830
Like hiring has changed.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:26.070
So one of the things that I'm very aware of is, right?

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.950
There's a lot of financial issues,

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:33.080
a lot of mom and pop companies going under, right?

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.520
COVID has basically, in some degree,

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.360
and I'm not commenting on whether or not I agree with it,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.960
but in some degree, that shifted the pain, right?

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.920
There's far more, right?

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.640
The mental illness issues are on the rise.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.080
People having...

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.600
That has nothing to do with testing though.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.440
No, I know.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.980
That has to do with COVID in general.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.020
And while I fully acknowledge that mental health issues

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:07.260
have definitely risen due to everything to do with COVID,

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.700
we have seen some wins though.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.060
So I'll tie this back into predictions.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.020
But one thing, there's a company that I work with.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.100
They make a test automation tool,

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.100
and they just got rid of their permanent office.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.100
They're a permanent remote work company now, and forever.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.260
Interesting.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.820
Which saves them a lot of money.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.780
I think it's probably happened a lot.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.860
I think what we'll see as we get into summer next year

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.650
is we're gonna begin to see...

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.890
Some companies have already said

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.730
people can work from home forever.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.650
Some companies have already made some decisions

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.570
about how offices will be different

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.050
when people start going back to work every day.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.170
We're going to see an onslaught

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.010
of companies doing different things too,

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:56.210
that both give people options to work from home

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.890
more often or permanently,

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.210
and then take advantage of that

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.850
by downsizing their corporate office space.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.570
There's a huge shift that we'll begin to see happen

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:08.410
as maybe some of that office space turns into housing,

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.650
easing some of the housing burden

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.530
in places like the Bay Area.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:16.130
We're going to see actual...

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:17.410
Actual is a bad adjective there.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.130
We're going to see continuous stipends

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.170
for people who work from home.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.450
We're going to see more and more remote work

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.890
from locations that aren't in the same city as the office.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:31.890
We're going to see just a lot more ongoing remote work

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.050
from people who actually enjoy it.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.370
Yeah, and there's gonna be additional complexities.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.630
For example, I just recently hired an employee

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.750
who will start in January.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:48.670
He's currently in the Bay Area.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:54.080
And so the time zone is the same,

00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.080
but he has to relocate in order to work from home.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.920
Right?

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.920
And the primary reason is because if he works from home

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.320
and being located in California,

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:15.610
he takes a end percent pay cut

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:19.330
because California has state income tax.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.170
Right, because you have to pay tax

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.370
in the place where you're doing your primary work.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:28.440
And there's something else that that has to...

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440
In this new world,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.680
I'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier in COVID.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.880
Like when we have employees moving to new states,

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.760
we have to make sure there's to work.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.080
We have to make sure we have a tax entity there

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.520
in order for them to work there.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.240
Right. Paperwork.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.800
We have, I know people who would like to go work

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.360
from home and home is another country.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.120
They cannot under a company policy under US tax law

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.520
because you have to have a taxable entity

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.830
for that company in that country.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:00.670
Right, and then...

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.150
So I think we'll begin to see some workarounds

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:08.150
for things like that for states and for the world.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.950
I'm not sure what they look like.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:11.150
We'll begin to see some efforts

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.530
to make that a little bit more,

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.050
not easy to do long-term,

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.130
but able to do on short-term basis

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.050
for things like visiting family,

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:24.330
for things like not being able to move right now.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.170
Well, so like one thing that I was thinking of,

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:32.170
one of my coworkers last Friday

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.950
moved his whole family down to Florida

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.790
and they've rented a house for the next three months.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:42.710
Right, and he took some time off

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:44.870
in order to execute that move.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:46.150
So from Florida,

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.070
and he's normally based in New York City.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:54.070
And he's gonna be working from home in Florida for that time.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:59.380
And I'm like, that, except for the anxiety

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.500
around working through the logistics of,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.820
okay, how do we make sure that this house is cleaned?

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.420
How do we make sure it's filled with all the stuff

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.620
that we can do?

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:14.660
I mean, ignoring all that, that sounds awesome.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.480
I agree, I agree.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.200
One thing I wanted to mention along these lines

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.840
is I'm not sure it was like for you,

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.720
you mentioned you added a team on the East Coast

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.840
during COVID, but I counted.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.760
And now over a quarter of my org,

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.920
as of today has never seen a unity office.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.460
Oh, interesting.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.660
We've hired a quarter of the team has been hired

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.930
after April, from April to now.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:42.770
Yeah.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.390
I don't know how that number extrapolates

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.890
across the company, but it's very interesting.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.130
Yeah, right now my team is at 50-50

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.090
because I hired a whole new

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.090
and then I had a couple of attrition.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.920
So people leave left anyway.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.430
Yeah.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.470
So that's interesting.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:09.150
And it's gonna get higher because I have a FinOps

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.070
rec about to go live just to do a program manager rec,

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.590
probably a few other hires in the beginning of the year.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:18.310
So I may have, won't get the half,

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.590
but more and more of my work

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.410
will have not seen unity office.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:23.890
Yeah, interesting.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.450
Yeah, it's a new world.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.380
One of the things that I'll end on,

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.460
obviously I think the COVID thing is too restrictive.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:40.040
I think we need to absolutely get that over with and done.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:46.180
But change always creates new exciting opportunities

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.420
for those who are on the lookout for them.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.360
This is how you make your own luck.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.840
It is, it is.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.200
A lot of luck is paying attention

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.520
at the right place in the right time.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.200
Yep, yep, all right.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.800
Well, that said, Alan, I wish you and your family

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.360
a fantastic holiday season and a happy new year.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.000
I'll see you in 2021.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
The same to you in 2021 and also to all of the three people,

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.040
all three of you listening to the podcast,

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.160
thanks for listening and have a happy holiday,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.040
happy new year.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.440
We'll podcast to you again in 2021.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.280
Yes.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.320
Is that what we're going to call it now?

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.440
No, I just did that to see if I could trigger your 2021

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.000
thing, I failed.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.240
It's 2021, when you call it 2021,

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.320
that's when I think you're weird.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.080
Oh yeah, 2020 and one.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.440
Oh yeah, make it even longer.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.260
That would be great.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.580
Okay, I'm Santa Alan.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.740
And I am not.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.740
All right, bye everyone.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:55.580
See you next year.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.420
Bye.
