WEBVTT

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.060
So I'm Alan. I'm Brent and together we do something called the A B testing podcast

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.600
We've done it for a couple years now pushing two years

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.880
almost two years and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.820
Just for fun today. We're going to take a recording of this and make this episode 29 of our podcast and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.620
Evan will send you a link. I'll edit out the parts that are that Brett will be probably inappropriate at some point

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.550
So we're gonna cover that

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.990
Honest, I'll be honest. Yeah, okay

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.710
So the way we do our podcast is the way we're going to do our presentation today

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.430
You don't see a big slide deck behind us

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.030
you see some things we're gonna talk about about surviving software in the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.110
Being software engineer in the 21st century fancy fancy title to get you here

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.230
Although I know the pizza is what you got you here

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.950
We're gonna talk about we talked about a B testing and cross that off

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.210
We'll talk a little about what's changing in software engineering

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.770
then we're gonna talk a lot about how you survive and adapt and change and the process is people in tech and then most importantly

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.600
We'll take questions at the end, but even most er

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.600
No, yes

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.820
Good thing I can edit the podcast right even more and more importantly is that this is gonna be totally interactive if you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.240
You don't have to wait for the end to have questions

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.000
Given that we don't have slides to go back and forth on and we just we have notes on things we want to talk on

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.400
but if you like I don't get that or tell me more about that or

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.880
In my group we have a situation close to that but it's different what we do here totally interrupt us and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.440
After we're done yelling at you will answer the question to our full extent work for you, right?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.640
Yeah, that works the you shouldn't you should feel welcome to interact, right?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.280
We have a list of topics both Alan and I could probably do for every one of these bullet points

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.000
I think we could probably do a whole day talk mostly brand. He talks a lot. My job is to keep him in line. I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550
Do blow VA? I apologize

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.290
So

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.650
If we hit on a topic that seems particularly relevant like speak up, it's okay. If you want to go deeper, that's fine

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.490
Well, we'll go broad across this space as we go through it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.250
But we encourage interactivity

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.610
Alright, so if you want to talk a little bit about do a plan here. What's going on? Yeah, it's right there

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.410
Red my also our podcast is very low budget and we refuse to prep and we're well known for

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.130
Ad we actually prepped very well

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.930
Brand has a nice list here again

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.410
My job is to fold three fold one give you some good information

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.370
To keep Brent in line three give Brent a bad time any chance I can

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.370
And he does all of those quite well. So shall we start by enumerating kind of what's what's different?

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.450
This like 20 years you've been so let's let's talk about ourselves a little bit. I don't like talking about myself

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.970
Okay, I'll talk about you. Okay. All right, so

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.970
Both Ellen and I have been in the software industry for 20 plus years. I'm not as old as I look

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.700
He's the way around he's older

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.950
the

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.590
Most sorry, I'm gonna interrupt you. Yes

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.700
I

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.420
When you should that one just for those that maybe didn't hear the question was what were punch cards like

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.780
There's a certain gesture I could use but

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.380
No, I've been doing this for 20 years

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.700
I'll jump in so

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.260
You all mostly look pretty young some of you probably weren't born in the early to mid 90s

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.100
90s kids raise your hands

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.020
Yeah, yeah, I'm old. So when your parents bought a computer in the early 90s it came with some music software

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.820
All right

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.460
No, actually you had to buy a sound card separately

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.820
So it came with some software from a company called MIDI soft and that crummy software. I tested it

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.730
That was my intro. So I was beyond punch cards. I got to use I was pre win 3.1

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.070
I got to use Windows 3.0 with multimedia extensions and that was my beginning

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.490
I joined Microsoft about two years after that and I've been there ever since all right brand blah blah about yourself. I'm done

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.030
Good question, by the way. Yeah, fantastic question. Let's have some more of that

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.450
In on the podcast like he he does use those hand gestures just interpreted it as your number one

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.450
That's that's what I do

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.500
So we've been in this

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.260
20-plus years the majority of the time we've been wearing the the title of

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.620
test

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.620
Alan's been test director

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.500
Up until about five years ago. I was middle management and test

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.530
and

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.570
Then Microsoft began to go through a transition. Okay

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.790
You want to talk I was gonna but I'll stop okay

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.130
Alan and I during that period of time even up until the transition we had been talking about this transition

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.250
I think what three years before it actually pulled the trigger because a lot of come it was happening in a lot of places

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.250
It's been sort of a slow wave across the industry. So it has

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.740
as part of that

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.700
Microsoft not only went towards unified engineering model, but they're shifting much more towards using agile practices

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.340
Yes, and in a lot more

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.660
Data stuff so five years ago I transitioned into a dev role into Bing

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.760
I was a dev manager and not that team

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.100
And then a couple years later

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.620
I've now transitioned into a data scientist role. I'm currently a data scientist manager

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.580
For the Azure compute team at Microsoft

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.770
Also in that same period of time

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.410
I've gone deep in in agile. I am a certified

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.450
agile trainer I

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:31.360
We don't like neither of us really care about certifications, but it does give me permissions to train other trainers

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.180
And Alan does stuff too I give a lot more detail. So no, but you know, the data scientist is

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.260
Anybody it's a statistician who lives in Silicon Valley

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.880
But all right. Yeah, so Brent talked about I'm gonna move on a Brent talked about some of the

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.120
Stuff he's doing some of stuff Microsoft is doing but

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.080
It's important to think about why

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.740
teams and companies and organizations are moving to using more agile stuff and and

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.020
maybe unifying engineering teams and blurring the lines being what Devin tests do and a lot of that is because

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.690
people see the value in shipping faster and

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.650
And I'm a big fan of a book called the lean startup you guys read the lean startup anybody

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.650
I know Evan hasn't cuz he doesn't do anything

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.180
but

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.340
There's I promise Evan. I give him actually five jabs today who in here was on Evans interview loop

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.770
Nobody. All right. Okay. Can we talk talk later? Yeah

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.090
I

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.130
There's a lion I thought horribly paraphrase from lean startup

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.450
But you just don't get value from your engineering effort until it's in the hands of customers

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.330
So if you can do that

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
Get get customers your software

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.930
Faster in a safe way where you can roll back if you screw things up and in a way

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.810
but you have the potential to learn from them there's all kinds of good things that come from that and

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.250
So I guess that drives a lot of the why on getting value to customers

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.090
They stick with your product longer because you're getting continued upgrades and value

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.610
All kinds of good things happen. What are some other reasons?

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.610
So it's not just speed

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.210
Also from from Reese's book

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
adaptability so it's

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.210
A lot of folks view agile as about oh, we got to go as fast as possible

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.250
It's that's a wrong way of looking at it

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:32.610
You have to be as adaptable as possible and when you are you end up going fast as possible

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.460
Okay, it's an important distinction

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:43.940
Adaptability right now is a huge business imperative in in any service environment your competitors are

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:51.770
Very likely, but let me put it this way. So you guys who's your number one competitor?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.380
Someone speak it out who?

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.260
Zillow, okay. I've heard of them. Yes

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:07.870
How long how much time does it take to some are for one of your customers to come to Redfin and

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.470
Decide to go to Zillow

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.340
Even even that long

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.070
Right, right. So I hope this is going somewhere

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:27.510
switching what the switching costs in an internet enabled service world is

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.220
Like that so you have to constantly stay on track

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.420
You have to constantly adapt to what is the value that your customers are getting out of your product

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.540
The

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.020
World that we used to live in 15 years ago

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:50.460
Where you could win by being the first to market doesn't work anymore you could win by

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.540
Microsoft strategy used to be

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.500
We had a whole lot of money. So we would let our competitors go find the successful market and

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.580
Then we apply our resources and then go steal it from them, right? So we didn't have to invest in their indeed

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.860
Hey, didn't you work in Bing? How'd that work out for you?

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.050
It's still ongoing

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.890
But I was the last test manager for the the Zune

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:22.250
PC client how about workout for you not quite as well. Did you work on Ken also?

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.090
Actually, yeah, I did

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.380
No, so Ken the Ken product unit had been dead, but there was one deal we had with Verizon

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.140
I ended up being as a test manager at the time

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.340
I was actually the last person to do a test pass on kin because there was no way I was gonna have any of my

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.340
team do this

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.560
Kin I'll paraphrase and put up on the internet a

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.790
Can I call it a failure? Yeah, I a colossal failure

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.780
We actually ended up making money with

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.660
Microsoft's gonna make this phone for tweens

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:10.090
And they're very excited about how lots of cool features and it made it almost a week or two in the stores where they pulled them

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.730
All in it was essentially a smart dumb phone

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.460
So it was a dumb phone, but you could still do some things you could go up on the internet

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:24.580
You could do some email, but the big deal was at that time a tween could go buy it for 40 bucks

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.520
right

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.320
Completely failed. All right

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.200
Quite a history there. Are you gonna screw up Azure to know? Okay. No

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.720
The other thing so if adaptability is a business imperative

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.180
Then one of the problems is that the traditional methods the the waterfall methods the

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.780
the engineering methods

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:57.380
Invented say 20 years ago no longer scale if you are competing with your competitors on

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.860
Features on a day by day basis. You can't afford a month-long test pass

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.020
Okay, just simply you can't

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.470
When I went to being

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.470
That's where I took my job job

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.790
When you shift to a world

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:22.630
Where the the scale of the problems that you have go a couple of orders of magnitude bigger

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.740
Then you have to start inventing new techniques

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.260
right in Bing

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:36.540
We ingest thousands of data feeds every single day the size the number the shape the schema changes every day

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.960
In in addition to that we have all of our developers within 15 minutes any single developer

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.360
can check in and it goes to prop within 15 minutes and

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.080
Any developer can do that within the stack?

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:56.250
We have multiple layers in the stack and of course that can change at any moment and

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.120
In addition to that it's Bing. It's a search engine. We have a machine learning engine in the background

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.000
That's also trying to take customer input taking the new widgets that

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.700
Individuals developers have put together and combining them to create a UI experience that changes every refresh

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.730
How do you test that you don't you can't?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.840
Bugs in Bing are completely worthless you file a bug in Bing a dev will come to you and say why are you doing this?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.840
I can't act on it

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.960
What what then becomes more valuable is the patterns data analysis data analytics?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.120
Understanding when is this when is the system making these changes?

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.130
That's fixable bugs

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.650
Again you could have a bug in one refresh you hit refresh it goes away

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:57.450
But the pattern that caused that initial bug is still in the system. That's what has to be rooted out

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.120
like

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.290
the

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.250
What are you looking at me for you're in the middle of a story? I'm babbling a lot

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.690
I'll go to the next thing then the other thing I would say that is a big shift

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.350
I'll go I'll just finish this off the other thing that I that this is how we roll

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.510
Another thing I would say is just there at my watch in a minute is quality

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:28.560
Quality the definition of quality changes in this world like in the world where bugs don't

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.760
matter

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.120
What matters?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.110
right

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.210
There's a phrase that I use now. I don't I no longer refer to bugs and quality as synonymous

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.550
I talk about quality and code correctness

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.750
quality is a

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:55.730
Subjective point of view if you have a bug in a feature that no customer has ever used or does ever use

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.990
Then it has no impact on quality

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.610
okay, a

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:07.640
piece of software that everyone uses is of higher quality

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.040
Than a bug-free piece of software that no one's yeah, and that depends it

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.480
Given you know because there's like if I asked this room

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.360
I get probably a hundred definitions of what quality is but if I use Jerry Weinberg's which is quality is value to some person

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.360
Can I get done what I need to get done?

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.710
you can have

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:33.350
Pretty high quality products that if nobody uses them you're not nobody's getting value from them or all of the elegance

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.640
How many have iPhones do you love your iPhones? Do you love iTunes?

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.150
Really, you're like the only person ever

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.110
That's weird so but what else you gonna use right?

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.800
soon

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.760
Didn't they deprecate the software so even if you have a zoom you can't like doing with it because we still we haven't exceeded the

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.040
time limit on the devices

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.040
Let's go for bureaucracy. So

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.970
What were you talking about you were babbling about something quality? Yeah, it was me definitions. Yeah

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:21.570
So I'm reminded of I clicked in I am I am approaching 50. No, I'm beyond Weinberg. Okay, there's in Brian Merrick in

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:31.810
1998 somewhere in late 90s introduced what we called the agile quadrants which in these books called agile testing and more agile testing

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:38.010
Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin talk about a lot which goes to your point which is when you think about quality you have

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.850
Engineering quality on one side and you have a customer facing quality over here

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:49.770
They're different and you also have technology facing and customer facing kind of going the other way without me drawing everything out

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.630
Your customers don't care what your code coverage is. They don't care how many tests you ran

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.090
They don't care how many failed and how many passed they care about

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:03.190
Do the experiences provide me value you think about all the different things that cover

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.910
what quality is and things we've done in testing and in in

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:14.190
Author testing out of not something just testers do but like unit testing very much in that technology facing

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:21.730
Engineering facing quality right good unit test. It could go coverage make sure they pass kind of that other quadrant way up here

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.050
You think about performance testing reliability even monitoring is up there

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:33.210
Those things are a lot closer to measuring what the customer perception of quality is but at the very end

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.890
What's the best way to get the customer perception to quality?

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:46.430
Measure from the customer right we can try as hard as we can as as engineering teams to go

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.490
okay, this is going to be the customer perception of quality and

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.370
Brent's a

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.400
Data scientist so we can probably predict

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.600
What the customer perception is going to be but that's certainly part of a big part of my my challenge

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.660
The so is there anyone here who's agile trained raise your hand if you are

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.870
Just just brand to one person know that all right

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.150
What are you all right now a couple of the people stepped in do you guys know about the pop and dikes?

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.870
I don't marry

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:23.110
Yeah, so her husband Tom in terms of his description of quality. I'm very very fond of it

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.780
Or it's not new description

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:33.430
But a quote he said everyone in software engineering needs to remember that no one ever

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.990
in the history of time

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.350
Has ever wanted software?

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:44.440
No one wants software. Okay, what they want is their problem solved

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.990
Okay, software is a means to the end bug correctness bugs

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:56.740
May or may not be a means to the ends if they get in the way of their problem getting solved, right?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.640
the to continue on with less so what's changed there's

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.260
So we we talked about there's a lot of new engineering methods

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.740
Waterfall thankfully is slowly dying, but it's it's holding on with waterfall is awesome

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:18.970
We didn't need to hire testers till the end the docks always got done because we couldn't go on until they were done

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.210
So it's great. Yeah, I know what you're talking about

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.550
When you shift to this dry sarcasm it just bothers me

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.110
The you know what bothers me like an interrupt

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:37.150
It's like I think in some vague power play you scooted your chair farther forward than mine

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.300
I just noticed that I just wish the chair was a little bit lower

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.800
No, I'm using this as a desk me tired of holding it. Well stop looking at it the

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.880
So there's there's lean

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.600
Lean and fast agile methods

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.600
That is a new engineering model. There's there's safe Kanban scrum

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:06.000
There's about ten that are really popular. These are really coming in and helping businesses to be adaptable in addition to that. There's two key

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.540
New engineering roles that we now see in sort of my you know

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:15.440
Don't you think that and this is actually being a real question that I'm has to be brewing and somebody said

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:21.630
Don't you think these all these processes and names kind of almost get in the way sometimes

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.010
I think people get so stuck in trying to go

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:29.710
Oh, we're gonna do this process and they get married to the process and they forget that they're trying to make software to solve

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:36.060
Somebody's problem. There's the process is help. I mean if you want pick one there is a bit there is a

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.200
There is a bit of that of the the monkey's experiment. Do you guys are aware of the monkey's experiment?

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.860
You will be in a minute. What's that?

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.400
No, not that one

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.240
That's a Shakespeare or something or other

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.640
The monkey's experiment in a nutshell is essentially they did an experiment years ago

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.920
They got I'll just make up a number. Let's say five monkeys into a cage. They put a ladder and a bunch of bananas

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:09.190
Okay, I like this story. I'll let it all what they did what they did is

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:16.830
Monkeys of course like bananas and so they'll go after the bananas climb up the ladder and acquire the bananas

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.150
What they did though is any monkey that did that they would spray it with cold water

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.790
okay, and

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.750
Monkeys don't like cold water and started getting trained at going after the bananas was

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.350
an upsetting experience

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:38.790
Then they changed it then what they what they did because monkeys still try they really like bananas

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:45.500
Then what they did is when a monkey went after the bananas they would spray every monkey

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.400
But that one right the first one was the first

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:58.280
Stimulus was to train the monkeys to get them to realize hey, there's a punishment associated with going after the bananas

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.800
Now they shifted to oh and by the way

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.170
That punishment that you got used to avoiding

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.300
Now if someone else goes after it, you're gonna get the punishment. Okay monkeys

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.180
Didn't like that and they very quickly got trained

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.060
to

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.180
Beat up the monkey that went after the banana. They didn't want to get squirted

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.320
Then what they who wants to get squirted, right? All right

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.360
Then what they did once they had that is a stable behavior inside that cage

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.640
They swapped out the monkeys they would they would take one monkey out put a new one that's never experienced it

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.040
but they didn't change anything so they put the bananas in and

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.180
The old monkeys would if that new one went after the bananas, he'd get his butt kicked

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.920
They kept on doing that until eventually

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.780
none of the monkeys

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.200
Had ever been squirted with water

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:00.910
But the behavior persisted and that's kind of the same thing when we talk about processes

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.070
It's you it's it's an encouragement to

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.020
Sure, you're used to things

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.530
Think about why?

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:15.050
Does it still add value and in the environment that you're in today? What can you change in?

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.690
Terms of the names like again as an agile coach, I would say

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:26.770
The first thing you should do if you don't have an agile coach in-house if you don't have someone who understands this topic

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.290
very deep higher one

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:36.430
It is hard to just shift it is very easy

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:42.870
Agile is actually a much harder practice than waterfall waterfalls very structured do this then this then this then this

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.630
Adapting means you have to know when to change

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.670
When to change when to say that rule that we had last week is no longer applicable here

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:56.550
So how many have ever like to have tried to change something and work like let's let's change the way we do X

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.350
Anybody ever how many of you have heard?

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.730
The biggest resistance was but that's the way we've always done it

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.820
It's there it's it's a

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.300
Name for that but I don't know my name is I don't like it

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:17.300
But it's it's common and you that that organizational change part that convincing part is a big challenge

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:23.420
But people can get really stuck in that's the way we've always done it. I've heard it, you know at Microsoft a few

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.960
100,000 times there's there's a phrase right if it ain't broke don't fix it

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.840
if you think it ain't broke then my question would be

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.800
How are you measuring that?

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.170
Okay, you want to kick stuff I don't even know where you are on your little note list

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:50.230
I'm done talking about the I got my list over here. All right, do you want to talk about kind of what's how you survive this stuff?

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:56.590
Yeah, so I should talk a little bit about what I'm doing now and that may kick some of this off. So

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.490
We're changing Microsoft a lot of teams doing

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.330
unified engineering big fan of it. Oh, it's like it like so

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.890
You know if it's the name I use because I hate the term combined engineering that Microsoft uses

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.410
Just means we have a software engineering team not a separate dev and test team

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:17.710
A lot of teams are going that way in various different flavors like Windows has check this out

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.710
Or the operating systems group they have

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:27.030
engineering teams or software development teams, I guess and then

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.290
Because we got rid of testers. They have quality teams

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.390
who

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:34.750
Do

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.350
Not as much

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:41.390
They do mostly some data analysis some to let adding metrics measurements to the code

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.110
User experience testing etc. Perf reliability those things all happen there

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.490
Devdiv has this developer division has the same thing

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.530
Where they call it the E&I the experiences and insights team does sort of the same thing

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.730
So if you're a developer know if you break something you break you fix your own stuff

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.690
the intent of the quality team is that

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.620
they would focus mostly on

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.260
Customer focus purely on data science

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.260
analysis telemetry

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.020
It is the illities

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.500
And that the development team would own testing

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:25.420
You know most of the testing of their own code, but I won't say they've done that transition particularly well yet

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:32.290
Not windows. Yeah, so I was in windows for a little while by I like to say that my

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:40.180
Two and a half years in Xbox was the best five years of my life and that my two years in

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:46.920
Windows was the longest five years of my life. Oh, that's gonna go on the podcast. That's cool. All right, so I

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.160
Which makes you what 60 months ago?

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:58.460
Brandt you're number one. Yeah four months ago. I joined a team that was all engineers all developers all former developers

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:04.220
But they were smart about it. They wanted to adjust an engineering team for the devs own their testing

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.500
But they realized very early on hey, we don't know a lot about testing

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.980
We're not so good at this and I'm sure there's a lot of stuff

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:16.380
We're forgetting letting through the holes. So my job is to be the quality guy on this team. So I'm the combination

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:23.250
Test manager test architect release manager probably something else. I wear a lot a lot of hats the team

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.850
Small team Microsoft size probably huge everywhere else. It's about

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.700
65 engineers

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.700
Evan knows that small for Microsoft

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.600
And my job is to make sure the developers know how to test so they have the right coaching and training to do that

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.200
The developers own all their own testing all the way up through integration testing including some performance from reliability testing

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.960
And then I have a handful of

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:56.600
vendors we use for some extra customer focused experience testing and for some extra stuff, so

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.960
So my role has been to be part of an engineering team. I'm a peer with all the other engineering leads on the team

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:09.760
so we have a director of development and all the engineering managers who run the different feature teams and I report to him and

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.130
So it's been a good experience and working in an engineering team figure out how

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.680
What it means for a development team to own

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.760
Testing their own code and sort of some of the challenges they go through and doing that

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.190
I think one of the reasons it works for me is Brent and I have talked a lot about this idea of

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:35.350
Generalizing specialist or specializing generalist meaning you guys know this term. Have you heard it before?

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.030
I was gonna talk about it. Shut up

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:42.510
So it means I've described my role for a long time as someone who does you know is a little about a lot and a lot

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:47.670
About a little meaning I can cover I can I can really kind of help out a lot of different areas

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.140
There are some areas I go deep on and the areas I tend to go deep on may

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:58.140
It may change depending on context when I joined the link team

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.420
It's called Skype for business now, but they had a team a very

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.700
junior test team who were doing a lot of

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:15.220
Manual tests all day and didn't really know a lot about test techniques or they just needed a lot of extra work

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:20.740
So my job on that team, I just left engineering excellence where I was a sort of a trainer and a coach and a consultant

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.140
So I went into that team and I spent about a year and a half

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:30.500
Helping that team become sort of better rounded testers only had approach automation throwing out most of their manual suite because it was useless

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.820
and

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.420
Kind of turning them into was a I thought a pretty well oiled team

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:43.100
Then so but very high level kind of organizational change and training kind of stuff then I went to Xbox where it was

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.920
We need someone who knows see really well

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.920
We can write a lot of tools and test tools and things to get Xbox one out the door

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.920
So I did that for two years and it was a blast

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:58.960
And I'm doing sort of a and I did sort of a combination of that on the but that my transitional team in Windows

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:05.440
I'll help us call it the transitional team. That's better and then I'm and then I'm like I said

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.160
I'm doing sort of a release management quality architect sort of role in this team. So

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.940
the the line that runs through there is I think no matter how your

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.000
Engineering team or your development team or your team is put together

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.560
You need in addition to people that can just crank out good code because you always want some of those right?

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.800
I won't ask you to raise your hand if you're really good at cranking out good code

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.000
We always need those people but you also need people who can plug holes

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.480
once I changed my my LinkedIn profile at the hole filler and

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.290
Because that's kind of my job. I've told all my managers

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.570
I figure out what's not getting done and make sure it gets done

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.610
Whether I do it myself or work through others to make sure it gets done

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:52.610
So my role is to recognize what those holes are and then get them filled. Oh, and by the way, I have a tangent

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:53.930
We were famous for our tangents

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:59.910
Do you guys get like a lot of unsolicited LinkedIn recruiter mail? So I know how to fix that

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.760
Change I changed my LinkedIn title to generic employee. I don't get any more emails

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.080
That one's free. You can do that

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:16.570
So you're gonna add something. Yeah, I want to shift a bit deeper, right? Cuz um

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:25.240
Alan is in a unique situation his last team change right most of the teams that we go and talk to

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.300
Are in transition they already have

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.180
say

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:38.400
Dev test p.m. And they're trying to figure out how do they move into sort of a more of efficient

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.280
team model, right

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.420
Alan got lucky in my humble opinion is that you started off it was a lock

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.780
It actually wasn't he was looking for he was looking for the perfect job for him

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.380
Is serendipity

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.780
What's the quote about luck that says luck is I can't even paraphrase it

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.560
Yeah, something like that. Like I was ready for luck to strike me

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.120
so I

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.080
Think straight I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna anyway. No, I was gonna go back to

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.560
So one of the experiences after I left Bing I

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:18.850
was

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.090
instrumental in helping the SQL server team

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.690
Go from sort of the similar point that you guys seemed like

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:34.130
That you guys are at now where you have these combined roles or not combined separated roles. How do you merge towards?

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.350
More efficient team for lack of a better word

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.090
There's a lot of struggles

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:49.580
Dev for example that will constantly ask well, what does QA do now?

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.260
Yeah, even when QA knows what they're gonna do now and explain it

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.300
they still ask this question because one of the biggest problems is

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.980
In essence a lot of deaths and I'm sure it's not here but a lot of devs for you testing as

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:12.180
Menial work, right? Why do I have to do that? It's below me. Okay

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.100
and

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.660
It's really not but you actually had a quote

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:26.180
Piggyback off of the the quality speech who owns quality the Twitter that you did a few months ago

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.300
I don't know what you're talking about fair enough

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.180
You said something if quality is

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:41.260
The customer subjective value something something something then who on the team owns quality

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:47.220
Producing that if quality is producing value to some customer then who on this team owns quality

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:56.250
Right. All right rhetorical question everyone owns creating value for the customer, right? I'm sure I said that I don't remember it was on

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.690
God you're old

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.850
The

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:09.550
So dev goes through a transition period if you guys choose to go with this sort of model tests will go through a transition period

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.510
I am a

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:14.990
huge proponent of

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.250
of the unified

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:20.220
Engineering model

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:26.880
I am too, but I don't know that it matters and I'm gonna interrupt cuz it doesn't matter as long as the roles are

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.740
Efficient and working together the second the roles become silos

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.780
Dev throwing stuff over the fence to test that's the exact work

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.780
I think the key is that engineering team is regardless of what you call yourselves

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.780
I was talking to Evan earlier and and

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:48.300
Everybody's just get to make up their own title because titles get in the way sometimes of engineering you think oh you had

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.860
You have this title whatever it is. And so I don't have to give you the time of day

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.900
But I remember in when I worked on Windows CE

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.200
That's an eye roll for people that missed it. I

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.640
helped this is probably 2004 I

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.360
Trained our dev team to write unit tests and

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.980
This is new to them. It's weird because

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.380
Developers about every other company in that time period were running right in their own unit test

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.780
But it's this brand new thing for these Windows CE developers. But the weird thing that happened was I

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:27.380
Developers come to me and say hey if we're writing unit tests, what are the testers gonna do?

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.860
I thought I can explain this and the reasonable question

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.940
What scared me more is when a tester came to me and said hey if the developers are writing unit tests, what do I do?

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.500
And oh, that's an interesting way to look at that

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.740
But when I think of my career I spent probably the first at least

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.780
Five years writing unit tests. We played this game of

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.860
Codependent ping pong I call it

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.540
where the developer gives me some code and

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:02.030
I quickly write a little test for it to prove that it's broken and I feel good because I found a bug

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:07.390
I'm validated. I give my code give the bug to the developer goes. Oh, thank you for finding a bug

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:12.270
Thank you for being my safety net. That's great. I love you and he fixes it and then he gives it to me again

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.350
I go I

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.310
Put a little more time on it and I find another bug I go that's great

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:21.190
He fixed it and I found another bug. I feel more validated here. Here you go again. He goes why thank you

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.950
This is great. I love you more and this goes back and forth and

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.310
It's really

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.990
Maybe the codependent metaphor is too far of it not too far off

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:35.670
But this ping pong when you think about efficient software, it's really inefficient to do that, right?

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.580
So a couple things come out of developers

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.180
Writing a lot of their own tests is one

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.380
I'm a big fan and I'll say everybody asked this a big fan of test driven development and especially

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.540
Even more behavior driven development. I'm talking about what those are in a minute for this

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.340
You guys know these I said I just talked about these in a minute for those you don't know what they are

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.900
But I said I wish I said I'm we're I'm there already know

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.200
Okay

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.680
That was Brent's attempt to giving me a bad time so

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:14.070
Keys here. It's very efficient for if I'm gonna write this code if I write some tests for it before or while I'm writing it

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.070
Make sure it works

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.080
Developers that write begin to write good unit test

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.860
End up writing more testable code

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.740
Because a lot of times I'm sure developers in the room have done this like I'm gonna write some code

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.700
You think I'm gonna write a test this. Oh shit. I can't test that

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.460
They go. I'm gonna refactor this which end up with this better code in the first place

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:39.580
Because you have to write testable code from the beginning and that code ends up being more usually more maintainable

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.130
Let's roll out the people yeah

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.810
Yeah, so

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:01.770
That's a good way and I take that one go ahead go ahead yeah, so better to have two minds yes

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:05.170
separate no, so

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:10.850
Huge proponent of pair programming where you have two people looking at at the same time

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.210
But the the trick with TDD

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.730
The the the brilliance of TDD is you test your code first?

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.160
So you writing up the test cases that need to pass before you write the code

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.390
Since you haven't written the code yet. You haven't yet been

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:34.200
Perverted by the assumptions that you're about to write so one of the things

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:40.480
That I did and then I want to piggyback on this and and that that's a great question because that ends up being

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.440
One of the challenges with the shift when I went to Bing I told you I went into dev

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.380
This was at the time where Bing was going with combined engineering

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.100
My team was 50% dev and

00:38:55.290 --> 00:39:00.530
50% test is this a long story no okay the testers ended up being

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.340
the

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.740
Better developers in the world where we have to ship every 15 minutes

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.220
right the the because the

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.180
Turns out writing code in

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.820
in small chunks

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.600
Is not that hard if you have a rock star?

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.640
dev architect on the team and say you need a

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.680
You're using an n log n and union log or a O of n algorithm

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.280
You you need to have the ability to have that second person to go and ask you need to be able to do knowledge sharing

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.250
But other than that the 80% of the coding problems anyone can do

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:51.710
But the thing we're testing it up being a huge advantage is they already understood the value and how to test

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.410
it ended up

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:59.180
What happened is my team first came first were very polarized

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.340
Had a bunch of devs that say we're specialists. We are the ones that own this code up and down the stack

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:11.540
But we're not going to do our testing because we own enough complexity and I said

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.740
Honestly what I did is I ran my team if you guys are familiar with Kanban

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.100
I ran my team with a Kanban model as highly transparent. Yeah, and

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.140
You only ship in two week chunks. Okay, so anybody does something wrong?

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.740
it's only

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:34.640
Two weeks of one person's code that that could have an impact and it's very easy to react and and repair

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:42.060
But what ended up happening is is I I didn't force these guys to shift

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:49.260
I forced them to communicate be transparent walk through the board and as they went through that as everyone was transparent

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:58.340
These guys were realizing that the testers were getting their stuff out faster. They were getting more features done faster

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:05.370
And then they started shifting right once the team started sharing knowledge

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:14.920
The people with the super awesome very highly specialized algorithms started leveraging and learning from the test guys and once that

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.120
Tests are that knowledge learning goes

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.600
Then this team becomes a rock star. I when I left being I'll close with this when I left Bing

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.600
Alan really wants to interject something

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.700
When I left being I had one of my peer teams came to me a PM came to me

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:35.400
I had a team of seven at that time and he said Brent

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:40.840
I don't know what you're doing, but your team of seven is kicking my team of 30s ass and

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:47.940
I said we should meet because I know what we're doing. It's not magic. We just think about it in a different light

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.840
Go ahead. Let me give you also a sort of a pragmatic

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.340
Answer to that from my recent past we had a

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:01.690
Bad bug in our product. It's not released yet. So it's tough back gonna be right?

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.610
but our VP was pissed so it was that bad and

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:09.490
There's like how is this and I got the how did we miss this?

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.490
How did this get through and it turned out that?

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:19.170
Developers who are learning to write tests like our team was they're very they were really really good happy path tests

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.610
Our product as long as you use our product as expected

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:27.330
No, it's not even close to the edge stay in the middle of the room. It ran great

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:32.130
But it wasn't until then that hit me because I'm doing all these hats that I realized

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:36.650
Oh, yeah, there's a whole bunch of other testing. I've been doing my whole life that we're not doing yet

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:43.970
So what I did there easy thing I met with the engineering managers and people on their team little half-hour meetings

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:50.210
We did a brainstorm made a mind map of all the edge cases and things like that looking at quantity if you want

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.130
I mean you're thinking about

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:57.130
We'll look at places where concurrency that can happen places where large amounts of data can cause a problem

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:04.050
Things like that, you know look at you know non English characters or if it applied etc

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.050
and all those things that were

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.290
testers are traditionally really good at helping the deal don't me just think about those because

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:16.690
one of the things that a generalizing specialist does that maybe a pure specialist doesn't do is we go into the the

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:23.090
10-foot level and dive in and then go back out at 10,000 foot level look around and kind of see how stuff fits together

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:24.530
so

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.930
Yes, it is

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.370
You could say that you're biased to your own code

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:35.810
But you can there's plenty of ways to get help on that because I think I know plenty of developers who are really good at testing

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:42.410
Their own code. So I think it's certain. I know for a fact is certainly possible and for those where it's difficult

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:47.930
I think it's a learnable trait. It is absolutely learnable trait and then there's always the model of pair programming

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.770
Although it's much like

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:53.410
my experience with TDD and in helping

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.210
Say specialist devs learn it's much like

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:04.250
The speech you can lead a horse to water right it they have to be motivated to want to drink from and if they're not

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:10.730
It's it's it's going to be a hard-fought battle. The other thing I'll also share around TDD

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.820
No, I want to highlight the benefit

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.350
Evan has a question

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.470
Okay

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:23.750
the other thing about TDD or doing this test having the test and their developer owning it and

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:30.050
When not with a model where again within 15 minutes it goes to prod it creates a

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:36.620
Sense of ownership on the individual first and foremost if they're checking within 15 minutes can go to prod

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.660
Then they don't have to worry about the blame game of oh, no

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.640
My fix is fine is that you didn't integrate right?

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.420
Right. It's there's their control of their own destiny and as they learn

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:57.980
So I'm a big proponent of balancing the preventative and reactive measures and as you learned where your preventive measures weren't working

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.660
You add tests and as you add tests you realize oh my god

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:10.060
The way I've written my code makes it a real peony ass to add tests. I need these tests

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:15.460
I'm gonna refactor my code and what I've what I have noticed that every team that goes into this

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:21.620
That that code gets refactored into much more maintainable much more testable

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.900
patterns across the entire team and when you have

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:33.300
That type of code your ability to produce new features and change features starts to go like this

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.070
getting in a rhythm is is

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:42.360
Actually key. I think ever you don't know what the customers are going to do so

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.740
Oh, actually, that's a that's a really good comment

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:51.500
The comment was repeat what the question was the question was if customers aren't going to try those crazy things

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.300
Why bother testing for them and it goes back to the comment earlier?

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.140
But if a but nobody finds a bug does it affect quality?

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.000
I

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.360
Don't think is a real reason to go super crazy on the edge cases

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:07.860
But like there is a particular object we could pass to a message as long as we had one or two

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.860
Which was the normal usage case?

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:14.160
Everything was fine. But when someone added four of those or five of those everything broke

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.550
So that's not really on the edge. So a little bit beyond the center happy path

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:24.390
It gets to a point this is gonna lead into what I'm gonna force Brent to be the next section

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:30.590
Which is there's a comment. I heard probably seven years ago, maybe a little longer at a GTAC conference in

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:37.110
San Jose a Google test automation conference where says sufficient monitoring is

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:43.820
Equivalent to testing. So if you have the monitoring in your system to know when

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:51.440
Every failure has happened to get and get the right alerts on that and know what paths are being used and what's happening there

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.320
Sufficient monitoring to cover all those cases

00:46:54.600 --> 00:47:02.420
Can replace testing? I want to be careful with that one though. I need say that I'm trying to tee up here

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:07.060
Go bright. Right. So you guys have heard I'm sure by now this concept of testing and production

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.620
Yes

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.500
Okay, it does not please dear God

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:18.680
It does not mean take your test suite and turn them into monitors that are on production

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.420
Okay, it means you do need those monitors

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:28.720
But it means you're looking at the the you're using your customers as your testers

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:36.260
It means that you have a much alone statement to write people freak out about that. No, okay. Go go go

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:43.480
Customers are fantastic testers. They are that and this is a point I always make for test reason go

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:48.880
I am the voice of the customer. I am the customer advocate. I am the customer and you're not

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.280
That wasn't very nice

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.000
But yeah, you if you can use the real customer as your proxy for the real customer

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.720
Yeah, it's always gonna be better off than using a proxy for a different proxy. Do you guys do flight control here?

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.960
Yeah, so imagine that you have a whole bunch of monitors that can tell you

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.720
What's your name?

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.200
Kevin, okay. So Kevin just did a check-in 15 minutes

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.480
It's now in prod. How does Kevin know that he just broke?

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:35.220
All redfin customers in Georgia. We have monitors that would allow you to know that in that type of world

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:42.930
Kevin kind of needs to know that right we need to have the ability to detect that something that the business values

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.800
Just is on the floor

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.920
now

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.720
So flight control also known as exposure rings is what you do is you?

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.600
Take Kevin's code you put it on

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:04.270
Call it exposure ring you put it on a segment of your customers say only a hundred people

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:09.530
Can see Kevin's code and then you have important signals if it passes those signals

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:14.490
Then you broaden it to an order of magnitude and you keep doing that until there's

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:21.120
Some some threshold where it's no longer value to keep just flip it all along

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.520
right

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.880
When we talk about tests in production really really at the end of the day what a test case is for is

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.800
to reduce business risk

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.960
That's the whole point you can do some of those things you need to do to do it preventively

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.320
It would not be a good idea for Kevin to do something

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:46.800
Where he checks in this fix and then anyone signs in and it deletes the customer database. This would probably be a bad idea

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.480
Right, but he has a unit test for that. That's all right, right

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:57.960
But he should have a unit test for that and and some mechanism as part of that 15 minutes to prod

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:04.080
Should be in place to check that no one can take out the entire business

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.970
Then things like okay, someone just signed in with some weird character

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.160
right that you can use your telemetry and you can use a

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.160
a reactionary process to

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:28.400
Get that going Google for example, one of the things Google does they used to be well known for shipping crap

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:34.260
All the time. They were always in beta. Okay, and I used to have arguments with people at Microsoft

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.220
He's like, oh, they're always in beta. They don't ship high quality

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:40.250
They're a fat

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:45.650
Okay, they're not a fad. I had actually these arguments and I'm like, you know what?

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:51.380
Their stock price and the number of users does not align with your statement

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:57.910
Right and the only way to make that for that to make sense and this is still in one of my test gigs

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:04.770
the only way to make sense is that bugs don't necessarily equate to quality or

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.730
Perhaps what's more important is?

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:13.530
As a business you're working to not prevent pain but minimize overall

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:18.370
Pain and what Google is masterful at they instrument everything

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:24.330
So they have a belief a set of hypotheses. It's like we think these are our

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:31.250
Catastrophic we're gonna pretest this code's not gonna go out but the amount of those test cases is not very large

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.270
Much much much smaller

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:39.430
They'll use exposure rings. So look at that instrumentation and they'll go. Hey looks like

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:44.730
We have more than we expect of people from Georgia

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:51.810
That's not are getting sign-in failures. Perhaps we should investigate that and see if we revert the code

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:58.280
so if you think of the purpose of tests is minimizing business risk and you think about

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.440
customer value as

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.960
Increasing it then you then you have the liberty

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:09.580
to start applying sort of an ROI through to

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:16.500
How you are doing everything you can use ROI to reevaluate your processes reevaluate your practices

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.920
the

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:25.320
The other thing Google is very good at is they can they can make a decision to revert the build right as I talked about

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:33.000
It would not go to the next exposure ring or yank it out. No, this is a bad build. We just destroyed

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:41.200
The experience for a hundred people in Georgia, but they can also go. Oh, it's not bad enough to stop it from moving forward

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.200
But it is bad enough

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.040
We're gonna get this

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:52.160
Fixed in in the next iteration and their iterations are either one or two weeks long

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.680
One of the things that I will say is that a huge time saver something. I'm very proud of

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.880
In the last five years. I haven't had a bug database

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.120
because I deal with it in real time I I

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:12.360
First got test clean. I first got bug clean then I started a cadence around shipping

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:18.680
Small chunks because if you ship large chunks, it's really hard to disentangle

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:25.960
But if I have someone on my team of seven and each one is going to ship something new on a daily basis

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.320
If I come in the next morning and it's on the floor

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:38.580
It's really hard are really sorry really easy to fix it because it's one person's one code

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:44.180
He might even be able to because the complexity is so small. He might even be able to fix it in line

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.240
very quick QFE

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.510
as

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:55.470
We go through that doing it. What QFE mean quick fix engineering release. What's the equivalent here? How fix?

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:58.980
the

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:03.830
I forgot where it's good. I can I can take a turn so

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:09.300
So I think we probably want to wrap up here and then take a bunch of questions

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.420
I think I think we want to get your questions and try and make sure we can adapt those so start thinking of those now

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:20.880
What works for us is I can go back to pragmatic our product hasn't shipped yet, but we're

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.720
I'm thinking hard about the plan to get there

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:28.140
And so we have you guys use continuous integration server you guys are shipping often

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.040
so we use a big fan of this this is where you catch all the

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.540
all the kind of devastating things that could happen you never want to get into a flight and

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:43.660
You're not really reliable tests there because we gate the build on these we gate deployment on these so it's like someone submits a change

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:51.520
It goes through this gate, which is a build unit test these all these other tests these their protractor tests running against the web page

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:58.130
If all those pass the bill gets deployed to our continuous integration environment, and that's updated all the time

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:04.190
So there's always a build out there with the latest check-ins in it. So that's going on all the time and then

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:08.950
What we're gonna do I know you guys are working on shipping much more frequently

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:12.550
But we're just my team is gonna start with one release a week

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:19.650
So and the good thing that happens from that is our team has been doing sort of for term on agile transition

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:24.130
I joined the team in the middle of their their love of what I'll call Scrummer fall

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.380
Which is we have a full week iteration?

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:35.020
Where there's some planning at the beginning and then the devs right and bunch of

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.620
Do a bunch of work and I make sure they're adding tests

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:42.220
But they still create a bunch of debt in there in there and then they try and cram in the rest of the debt at

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:47.820
The end at the end of that four weeks have a really crummy product that stabilizes the first week of the next iteration

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.500
Being transparent it's not perfect

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:57.380
But by moving to this by we're gonna shift to some internal customers coming up soon and by moving to that model

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.100
I got everyone bought off on shipping once a week

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.120
Which means whether they want to think of things as a four-week iteration or not

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:10.380
I can now in caps things kind of line up into a weekly rhythm and that's when Brent mentioned that earlier

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:14.860
I really clicked on that is having a shipping rhythm is really important

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:21.860
Teams can adapt to that like we know we have a one-week rhythm where you know, we're doing a bunch of validation on

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.540
Monday and the bill and we do some self hosting dogs

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:31.220
But on Tuesday and then we promote to production on Wednesday and then features are finished up for the next thing Thursday and Friday

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.380
And we start all over again. It's very nice so we can crank that up that

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.260
Speed up as needed but it gets

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:40.450
One of the things I'm looking forward to in that is like Brent said I don't

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:45.650
Well, first of all, we have a bug database and it's populated with more things and I'd like right now

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:49.930
But we're gonna I'm in the back of my head to put about

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:52.930
Organizational change my plan is

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:58.330
Little by little without the team realizing it because I'm not even gonna tell them they're doing one-week iterations

00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:03.410
it's just gonna happen and a little by little we're gonna become a little bit more agile and and

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:05.890
eventually I

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:12.170
It's gonna be like the perfect team for me. I'm trying to mold them to be like what I want

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:14.170
I want to be clear though

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.150
Clear all day. I'm gonna try now

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:25.850
My teams I saw we don't have a bug database and I've haven't in five years, but that doesn't mean so

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:33.670
My teams still have developers in them and they still are human which means they write bugs

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:38.830
So my team still writes bugs, but the way we treat bugs is when we encounter a bug

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:47.120
That we have validated as customer impacting that we have a process. We call it the swarm process

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:53.440
Any bug that comes to my team the whole team jumps on it and that thing is gone within 48 hours

00:57:53.880 --> 00:58:01.210
So bugs we viewed not only something that's harming our customer, but it's harming the overall

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:05.160
Process

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:12.660
And quality of not just the code but everything so I'm an efficiency geek and I mentioned earlier the the codependent ping-pong game

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:16.080
which is very inefficient and also it's very inefficient and

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.680
But by the way that that cost of a bug curve, it's mostly a myth don't draw don't draw that ever

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.680
Holding on there is a cost

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.600
accruing debt

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:33.280
So if you're gonna yep, that's a great bug. We'll get to that when we get to it. That's inefficient

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.120
It's so much more efficient to go. Oh, there's a bug. Let's fix it

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:41.520
Let's get it. Let's we don't want we don't want those when you can get to that zero and there's a transition step

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:46.140
To get there doesn't happen all at once. I've known teams that have gone through this and you kind of go for

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.140
Okay, let's have and what I'm doing right now is we have zero bugs at the end of our iteration

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.380
usually it's about two days into the next iteration and

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.080
Eventually, we're gonna be at zero bugs every Friday for the weekend

00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:03.660
Our sappin and now eventually move into zero bugs all the time. I was planning my head all worked out

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.900
There'll be bumps along the way

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:10.260
But this is this is where I want to get to but you can't just go to the team and go

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.780
That's it. Everybody fix all your bugs. I'm not gonna have anymore

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:27.620
I think that's a typical I my team customer impact 100% my my team fixes a hundred percent customer

00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:30.360
impacting but so what we will do though is

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.580
the bugs where

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:42.620
Hey, if a customer does this sequence of clicks at exactly midnight on February 29th it using a by dye character set

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.700
Yeah, I will make the call that that's

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.180
That might be a bug I can look at your code. It's absolutely bug

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:55.060
We're not going to fix it until we have proof. There's somebody impacted

00:59:55.500 --> 01:00:00.060
I'm sure a lot of people in this room. I've worked on products have had multiple multiple releases and

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.220
I'm sure a lot of people in this room have bugs like we don't want to fix that

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:09.220
But we're gonna hold on to it because we may get to it next time then next time rolls around and you go. Yeah

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:14.560
We're gonna do that next time and you end up with this bug. It's like 40 years old

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:20.800
Okay, four years old but and it's like yeah, we're gonna get to that note. That's one thing

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.240
that I'm very adamant about and it's

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.000
My bug triage like this is customer impacting. Yes, we're gonna fix it and we're gonna fix it very soon

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:35.720
But we're not gonna fix it at all. So and that's the thing I want to I want to get a couple other things number one

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:43.510
We won't fix it if that bug comes in the February 29 scenario. We'll go. No, it's fixed

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:50.870
Okay, we track all of our bugs as tickets on our scrum board. Okay, I will take that ticket and it goes the trash

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:56.270
I'm going to completely from here on out ignore its existence if it comes up again

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:58.750
I'll say okay that we have customer impact now

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:03.430
Hey, and if the answer is still no it's gonna go back into the trash. Would you I have a

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.790
Would you

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:13.970
Could you would you could you dr. Seuss on a boat with a with a boat add?

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:17.170
I'm gonna go add a little bit of instrumentation here

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:23.850
So I know if this I'm gonna track how many people February 29th at midnight are are are entering but yeah, yeah, absolutely

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:27.190
it's so

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:32.670
Me that's what I most bugs where I would have with with one of my reports isn't gonna be so

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:38.790
Hyperbolic right it's going to be hey, but it could if this this and this and there's this other thing

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:45.310
And there's a reasonable expectations could but we don't have any proof that any customers encounter that I'll say you tell you what

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:48.170
Go refactor it go ahead and add instrumentation

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:50.870
We're gonna keep the code the way it is

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:54.270
But if if you're proven to be right I want to be able to switch on a dime

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.550
So make sure that the code can switch

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:02.510
And you can go the other way on that too. So imagine I'm gonna this is purely I'm gonna make up a bad example

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.710
That's what I'm best at like say you

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:11.930
Somebody comes says hey look I found this bug where if someone searches for a house that has an odd numbered address

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:17.790
In a state where the abbreviation has an a is the last letter and it's over a million dollars

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:24.050
This weird thing happens to the page or something bad happens again totally made up not a great example

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:31.490
But ideally you could go you could you guys fixing it's gonna be a real pain like okay. What's the impact?

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:38.370
Ideally you want to be able to go to your data that you've clicked it from your site and go how how often does this happen?

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:43.170
How likely is this to happen and use data to help you make a decision on on the customer impact of that as well

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:50.170
Yes, and if you have that data, then you should be able to align it very readily to what will be the business impact

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:53.010
Because you also have if you have that data

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:58.290
Then you have the data of all the other type of bugs and now you have the ability to sort of work through

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:03.470
Customer impact in what's on this parade order or the 8020 rule the other thing

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:09.010
I also want to bring out around this process that really makes things super sweet at the end of the day is

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.050
It's really it makes

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:20.630
Bug-free code or bug ish free code is much easier to add features to

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560
Much much much easier

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.380
Yeah, and that's what the business is really valuing

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:33.700
I've been preaching that to my team as we knock our our bug debt down is that you guys we forget ship once a week

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:39.820
it's much easier to give value to customers if we're doing that on top of a stable code base and they all down their heads and

01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:46.770
Slowly too slow for me whittle down that debt. Okay. I think we've covered pretty much. Oh, we've everything

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.970
We've covered more you don't get to bring your little note sheets anymore

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.600
I'm still bringing them. All right

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.320
We do some questions. Yeah, please. Yes

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:12.020
Yes, so I like to think of that sort of like a two-axis. Oh, sorry

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.740
Wow, they're watching me closely

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:22.100
So how do you how do you differentiate between the bugs that are minor but a lot of people hit and they're and the kind of the

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.820
Really bad ones and I like to think of bugs on that that to access

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:32.260
Scale of like how many people does it hit and you can get that from data and then how bad is it houses severity?

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:36.340
So is it is the the crash that only happens at midnight?

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.460
on the February 29th when you're entering bite-eye characters versus the

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.740
Cursor that disappears for five seconds for every single user using your page

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.890
One is not very severe, but you really want to fix it it

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.480
In my current team. One of the things that we're working through is something that we're calling a pain index

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.100
We have every team. I think I've been on at Microsoft has built a pain index

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.260
Yeah, I'm gonna build one. All right, cuz it's never been done before no

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:13.380
But I get to do it data science II way not a god old-school test way no spreadsheets this time

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.520
Gonna use our if you think of risk

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:27.760
You're number one too well if you use if you the biggest thing about risk

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:33.760
Right is how frequently does this thing occur and then what's the severity?

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:40.400
So all sort of impact statements it can be measured by frequency and severity now

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:45.320
you guys got to transform or translate what severity means in terms of

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.120
An impact to the business or the impact of the customer now

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.520
I'll also tell you the more you can make those things synonymous

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.160
The more you are measuring the business in terms of impact to the customer

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.460
then the more

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.660
this

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.660
really flows I

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.420
had the

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.580
Talking about the glory is again when I left Bing I had the ability

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.420
to in essence

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:16.440
When I was doing some of the the data science stuff that I was doing in Bing

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.540
I had the essence the ability to tell individual dev teams

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.860
the consequence of this bug yesterday by dollar signs

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.080
and once we had that and

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:35.330
And the ability to sort of argue through that no that wasn't just a random number generator

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:37.540
a

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:42.500
Dev started engaging because no one in this room wants to make unhappy customers

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:48.380
But a lot of what we do is based off of an intuition a base off of belief

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.660
Well, this would really impact me if I was that guy in

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:58.500
In that situation on February 29th. This is how I feel empathy is high

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.380
the data allows you to get much more accurate and get to the

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.940
Truth and the once you get closer to that you can really iterate faster

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.540
So I believe the answer to the question was yes next question. Yes

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:24.430
so what about the this is actually a

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:29.910
Tailor onto that question, which is we do with the gray area bugs that are like this is wrong

01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:36.550
But you know the devs to the hopefully just the dev team doesn't have the only choice on what gets fixed

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.480
Here it should be for my team

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.420
We have a design team that would make that call and my design team is

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:51.060
Massively anal so that bug would get fixed all the time. So ideally, you know for me it's

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:57.660
It sort of depends on the team culture and what you're building but the way I think he was addressing it is great

01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:02.420
I think we all know how to solve any decision making in any sort of command and control structure

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.680
So you had a design team? Well, they're the winners. Yep

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.960
How do you do to have the customer be the winner?

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:21.570
So, how do we make the political decision to fix all the bugs design team files luckily the design team fixes in themselves

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:30.190
They own are they not only design but they actually know the magic of CSS. So yes

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:46.560
So the question is do we have any experience in property based testing using some tool? I haven't heard of right

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.620
I'm not familiar with property based testing and I'm pretty sure that we understand what you're talking about but not in the way your phrase there

01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:03.670
Oh, so test generation libraries not necessarily fuzzing but test generation like for for any sort of test data

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:12.630
Yeah, I use a tool a colleague of mine. I wrote when I worked in engineering excellence work with a guy named

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:16.770
The BJ Rellison who's one of the authors on the on the book I wrote on

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:19.530
One of the books you can buy no don't buy them

01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:21.530
like

01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:26.370
That was that was like Google AdSense just popping in and put that ad there

01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:31.570
He wrote this tool called babble, which I believe you can still find on his website

01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:34.550
But it generates strings in any language

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:38.890
So I use like that and it has an API as well and I use that today

01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:45.930
I also use a tool believe it or not that James Bach wrote called pro clip and pro clip is an awesome tool

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:51.390
For it'll generate any length of string you want and with this idea called counter strings

01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:55.850
It's actually a pretty nice tool for figuring out what the limits of entries are etc. I've

01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:59.950
It's a pretty easy way to I showed dad like it's not that big of a deal

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.930
But you show somebody who hasn't done testing before and they go. Oh my god

01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:08.400
If you put a long string in my field it breaks who would have thought of that

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.840
Yes

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.120
No

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:21.960
You definitely have to so the question was no sorry when you go 15 minutes to prod you probably can't build and test everything

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.240
So what do you do?

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.380
How are you guys doing it? I can explain go so I was asking you the question one of the things

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.900
So first off you you if you can leverage the system and it turns out in Bing

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:37.290
We are able to go massively parallel

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.500
And and a lot of the machines in Bing the the production machines have idle cycles

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:48.460
So we're able to capture those idle cycles and turn them into a parallel test bed

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.090
Okay

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:55.530
Certain but the the other thing too is if you're gonna be live in 15 minutes

01:10:55.570 --> 01:11:00.610
Then you need to have the data that you can react to much sooner than that so that you can make a decision

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.690
It's going to go

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:05.800
So but you want to have an opportunity to make a decision to stop it

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.880
And it's not always going to go there are certain

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.280
Monitors in place that will stop any flow, but anything that's decision-making it's up to you

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:21.020
You have to think

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.820
differently around how your code works

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.640
The the the best example is any build

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.360
And you can do this whether it's a big service like Bing or it's even an on-prem product if you think about

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.040
the concept of an RTM build and

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:45.680
You you make a commitment you change the architecture in the process of your team and say we're gonna have a build that is always

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.040
RTMmable and one of the things that I actually tell people

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.940
Ship releaseable releasable. He's using weird words. Just ignore

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.850
It may not map to to this world, but hopefully you'll follow

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:06.510
So if you have a build that is it's up to the business team whoever owns the business team

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:10.420
Hey any build in this branch

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:17.410
You guys can decide the ship at any time. You don't even need to talk to engineering, okay

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:25.160
Then you have to then create a new incremental process such that you incrementally enhance that bill

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.980
Right now I encourage this process because you don't want if you can get to a point where engineering

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.300
Isn't part of the call of whether or not it ships

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:41.790
Then engineering then becomes a little extra diligent around making sure that they're safe because

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:49.600
This could be shipped by something that's outside of my control as you do that incremental then you do incremental testing

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.660
so you you compare your bits to

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.580
the RTM bits and

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:59.920
Then you can use co-coverage you can use standard tests to really pair down

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:08.320
What needs to be done and then if you then further enhance it with sort of an exposure rings with these monitors you really

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:15.120
Pair down the amount of proactive testing that you need to do to achieve the same degree of risk prevention

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.720
All right, let's do

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:29.900
That's a decision you can make so if you're making it

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:35.980
Yeah, so if you're making a claim that like what's different RTM and broad basically and you can you can make the same thing

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:42.540
RTM is for users like me who shipped a lot of products before the web existed

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:45.910
Yeah

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:48.110
RTM and

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.870
We had to we had to ship our code to some

01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:55.970
Factory and who knows where so that they can burn our code on discs. Okay

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:59.790
That was the version of shipping to prod back in the day

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:04.070
All right, their eyes tell me their butts are tired anybody had one last question

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:06.510
Yeah back here I've heard from you

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:12.990
So the question is if this is actually a good one to close on if agile is about adapting and we talked about people being

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.390
resistant to change

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:20.910
Don't those work against each other and the truth is is you're absolutely right, but people still are resistant to change

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.030
it is

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:25.350
people get set in their ways and anytime there's a

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:30.900
Sort of you want to do something differently there are people probably like you and I am brand to like yeah

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.580
Let's go first. Try this out and see what works. I really believe in trying things out

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:38.440
Do a little bit of a time see what fails learn from that try something else

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.200
There's there are other people who are and we've worked with them

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.600
I'm not gonna point them out in the room

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:49.760
Evan told me who they were beforehand but some people who are like I'm fine the way I am

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.200
I don't need to change we don't need to do it differently

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.080
So you have those on both sides and then you have people in the middle who are kind of just kind of waiting to see

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.760
What happens? Yeah, whatever wherever you guys go. I'll go I'm going for the ride and

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:07.600
So you'll have 20% on one side 20% of the other and then everyone know what the numbers are

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:14.400
But yeah, it's you anytime you're making some sort of change even if it's about agile which is about being adaptive. There's

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.520
You still have a people problem is another Jerry Weinberg quote

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:23.400
I like says it's always a people problem and you always have to figure out how to

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:28.400
What the motivation gonna be to get people to change some people are very much driven by data

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.120
Some people are driven by you know more intrinsic things like simple just excited about

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:39.600
Big fan of the Dan pink work talk about change Dan pink says that people are give people are motivated by progress

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.840
So if you can show them with this change like oh, we're moving faster and cool things are happening

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.400
Then those naysayers are slowly slowly jump on board

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.080
You have to have a seed in which everyone agrees

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:56.000
Like if we are all deciding that hey, it is valuable to the business that we ship every hour and

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.600
And it's going to affect income growth something that the business values

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.960
then

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.320
Yeah, a lot of the adaptability can come into play but a lot of people

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.960
Honestly don't believe in adaptability, I don't know if that's going to be here

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.080
But they don't see it and they don't understand that value

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.800
in addition to that Alan has this

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:26.870
I'll let him decide if he introduces you to definition behind fragile teams, but you've all you've all

01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:29.870
encountered those teams where hey

01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:34.750
We're gonna be agile and then the person who's leading that agile transformation basically

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:42.140
They read the first chapter of the Schwab book and then decided oh they get the rest of it and then they deploy

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:48.740
Part of the concept that they picked up and and the rest of the stuff that they messed up or haven't

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.020
fully absorbed

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:55.330
And then and then discover Oh agile is a bunch of crap. It doesn't work

01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:58.450
It was primarily because what you did

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:04.060
Wasn't agile. So when I probably go deep into fragile, but fragile is when you

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:10.260
Just pick a few parts of agile and then try and go with them and they don't work for you

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:13.540
But I one thing I want to make sure I mentioned before we close is

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.300
Elizabeth Elizabeth Hendrickson. Thank you. Yeah, sorry Elizabeth

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:22.100
She has this quote which I'll get all horribly paraphrase about agile the litmus test for agile is

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.940
frequently delivering

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:28.060
Delivering frequent customer value at a sustainable pace

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:34.300
If you're doing that you're probably agile doesn't matter if you're to the book on something or far on the book

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.380
But if you're too busy, it's really easy to get stuck in the process

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.380
Like we've probably looped all the way around where we started

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:44.780
But frequently delivering software at a sustainable pace and that has doing that

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.020
May cause you to change

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:54.100
some of the things we talked about today like how lines are blurred between what Devin test were forever and how

01:17:55.260 --> 01:18:00.540
Engineering processes work and who owns what how to gain those efficiencies to get that frequency that you need I

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:04.190
I am also

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:09.270
Don't encourage any more of the usage of the turn agile even though I've used it a lot here

01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:14.510
I definitely prefer adaptable agile means is highly overloaded

01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:16.510
It means multiple different things

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:18.180
I

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.140
May or may not those of you who are agile experts

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:25.040
You may may not agree with me in terms of let's say a specific debate

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:31.660
But hopefully would all would agree that adaptability is really what's critical really what's important and there's different

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:36.300
Techniques and tools to get there. Yeah, one thing I learned from Brent was on the spectrum

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:43.210
There's you know waterfall was a predictive model and then there was spiral and some forms of agile

01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:48.170
What you're kind of in that middle ground of their iterative models scrum is an example that so it go from

01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:55.290
Predictive to iterative to adaptive. I think the the right way to make software especially web software in

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.520
Least for this decade might change ten years from now

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.200
But I doubt it is to make sure you're adaptable make sure you're always learning

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.760
From your customer always learning from your engineering practices, etc

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:12.770
Anything else? All right. No, I think we've closed out. Okay once again, I'm not Brent

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:16.370
I am. All right. Thanks everybody. All right. Bye guys
