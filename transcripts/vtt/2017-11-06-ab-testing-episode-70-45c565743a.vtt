00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.660
Good morning, everyone. Hello.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.820
Morning. Hey, there's someone else in the room.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.630
There is fire.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.180
Let's see what happens. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And I'm Steve.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.060
Welcome to ABS testing. Hey, ABS.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.900
We're plastic. Abs. Abs testing. We will improve your abs.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.040
Steve Rowe is back for a return engagement on the AB testing podcast.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.840
You last heard him on episode 46. Is that right?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600
That is. Thank you very much for bringing me back.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.160
He has it framed on his wall, the digital bits, some ones and zeros framed in a gold frame.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.840
It's a big wallpaper. It takes the whole wall.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.600
Yeah, he bought that himself.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.520
Actually, that's kind of a geeky, cool idea. I have a welcome mat with Tangentime.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.760
I have a welcome mat with like welcome written in binary. But what if you just,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.860
you could make some wallpaper. It could say you could put a book and just decode it to

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.940
ones and zeros.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.220
And have that be your wallpaper for your hex codes.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.380
Yeah.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.460
Now, then you could sit in there and you could get a table in the middle

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.620
and you could do on that table. You could build the new $800 Millennium Falcon from Lego.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.940
There you go. It's pretty impressive. I saw it at the mall.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.180
We were talking about the the Lego Millennium Falcon before we recorded.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.170
So I had to bring it up.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.330
So I wonder what book would you pick and how big of a room would you need to put the whole book?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.130
These are things that I haven't thought through yet.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.890
It could just be with binary. It could just be a short passage.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.570
You know what? It could even be a digital representation of my favorite picture.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.170
It could be Lorem Ipsum.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.220
Yeah, that's what it should be.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.220
That way you can mass produce it. We have to be custom.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.620
We're just making nice Lorem Ipsum generated into binary wallpaper ones and zeros.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.780
Someone's going to take that idea and make a lot of money and I'm going to be mad.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.300
Custom binary wallpaper.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.940
Isn't that like the matrix screensaver in wallpaper form?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.380
Oh yeah.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.100
Okay, so we have, welcome Steve. We have an agenda, right?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.820
Theoretically.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.380
Theoretically we have some stuff written on the whiteboard to get through.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.220
Brent, why is Steve here?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.100
He's our favorite guest ever.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.580
He is.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.900
Yay me.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.740
That's true. That is true.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.020
He is our favorite guest ever. So we'll give him that.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.020
So I think there are some other reasons. I'll see if I can guess since you're

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.620
unwilling to take the lead from me.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.180
I think Steve knows a lot about applying data to quality and testing.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.300
And I also think that Steve just gave a talk on a similar subject at Star Canada.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.980
Yeah, one of the themes that we've been talking about a lot lately is more pushing

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.380
the test industry to get more and more active with their data.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.380
Move away slightly or begin to move away from this prevention model and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.690
using data to react and drive towards better customer quality.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.530
So Steve had did a talk in Star Canada.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.650
When was it? Last week?

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.370
About two weeks ago.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.730
Blame Canada.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.810
In Canada.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.500
I am doing a similar talk for this unknown little company in Bellevue on Tuesday.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.860
So Brent's going to this tangent time because Brent's all excited that he's on the guest list.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.820
My entire team from around the world is descending upon Bellevue.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.340
First people arriving amidst a flurry of snow today, arriving through the weekend.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.140
We're going to spend Monday through Thursday doing a lot of work together.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.300
We have a few external speakers coming in and most of my leads dried up.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.660
So I had Brent come in.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.580
Wow, scraping the bottom of that barrel.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.740
And Brent's going to talk about applying data to quality.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.580
And by the end of this podcast, he may be fired and Steve may be coming in,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.940
but we'll just kind of see how it goes.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.500
Just let me know.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.060
Anyway.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.700
Yeah.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.460
My manager had a meeting.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.740
He wanted to schedule on top of that and I'm like, no, can't do that.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.180
Maybe I can do that meeting after all.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.460
All right.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.580
Steve knows about data quality.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.620
Right? Were you going to set him up to ever talk or is he just going to sit there and say,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.500
yep, and laugh at me picking on you?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.060
I'm like a little sidekick on the talk shows.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.340
I just laugh a little bit.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.300
Throw some jokes out.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.020
Yes.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.580
Steve is actually wearing a Robin costume right now.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.660
It's a little awkward, but it's adequate.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.420
It's actually no, it's actually for a game called hand of the gods.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.070
So yeah, which is my new addiction.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.210
So so Steve and I chatted briefly.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.650
I thought that this was an interesting adjunct to what we've been talking about here.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:29.210
So Steve, why don't you describe number one, what you went to start candidate to to present.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.970
And then be interested to hear sort of what your take of Star Canada in terms of.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:46.220
We've been talking here a lot lately around this idea of a modern test team versus a traditional one.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.300
Love to hear your insights around what you observed along those topics at Star.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.860
Sure. So I came to start a talk about using data in in testing.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.060
Like actually a lot of the content that was that I presented was stuff we talked about back in

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.060
episode 46. If I actually went back and listened to that to remind myself of some of the good

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.020
ideas that I'd forgotten since then. So I talked about.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.260
So are you saying we've talked about this before?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.180
I am saying we've talked about this before.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.980
Just checking.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.780
Drink.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.180
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.220
So I went to talk about how to use data in your testing and I kind of had to gauge.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.860
It was interesting. I didn't know what audience exactly I was going to have to

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.220
at the conference. So I wrote up a set of slides and then throughout the conference as I

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.380
saw other presenters and talk to people I tweaked my slides to kind of aim at the right audience.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.180
I didn't know.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.580
By the way, I love that technique. I use that a lot.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.260
It works pretty well. So they ask you for your slides like months in advance,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.780
but you present your own copy so you can change them.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.540
Actually, something I learned from our buddy James Whitaker is always change your slides.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.700
Turn in your slides because they want them in advance, but change them.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.860
And then you can say, oh, if you want to copy these latest slides,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.820
you can download them from my website that drives traffic to your website.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.740
Does it actually drive traffic to your website?

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.100
If you're James Whitaker, it does.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.620
Oh, okay. I don't think I got much traffic.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.660
I said you can ask me on Twitter and I don't think anybody ever did.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.900
But anyway, so I was talking about using data in testing.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.300
So I talked through kind of the history of testing, how we kind of went from manual testing

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.260
to kind of more automated testing. And then I'm moving to this more

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.380
data-driven quality or what you guys are calling modern testing.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.500
I talked to that. I talked through ways to bootstrap your area into using data.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.940
You know, use the data that's already in your log files, then add some instrumentation, et cetera.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.900
So I talked through kind of all that and how you get to the point where you can start using data.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.540
Because a lot of these people come from a background of very traditional, very manual testing.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.820
And so they're not even at automated testing a lot of times.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.100
And so it's quite a leap forward.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.300
So I was kind of trying to introduce that topic to them and say, hey, this is coming.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.940
You know, you should be familiar with this thing. Here's kind of what's going on.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.420
The conference itself, there was an interesting kind of tension that seemed to be going on at the

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:01.900
conference. The big word in the air was DevOps, which doesn't mean quite what DevOps always means.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.140
But it seemed to be more just a bunch of automation.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.100
And so there was definitely people like I saw a talk, a very good talk actually,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.260
on behavior-driven development, which was really more unified engineering.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.820
And why getting your dev team and your test team together and having them start at the same

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:24.060
time is a good plan. And if you're in a box software prevention world, it's a great model.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.700
Obviously, we think that we're moving beyond that model now. And that's insufficient for

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.980
most purposes now. But I saw some of that talk. But I also saw the whole,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.460
ML is not coming to eat you talk. And I saw a discussion about how none of you are like

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.980
Netflix and none of you are like Amazon. And so you can't use any of these techniques

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.820
because you're all special snowflakes and have to do all your manual testing.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.780
You know, and so there's this kind of, it was interesting.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.460
Yep.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.540
Can you add some clarity around like the themes you picked up or the argument around how ML is

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.060
not coming to eat you?

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.380
I can't actually. So the talk that I saw there was the conclusion was literally here's

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.220
an introduction to ML. And then the conclusion was I talked to my friend who's really good

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.220
at this stuff. And he said it's not eat, it's not going to come. That was literally his argument.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.100
I was, I was boggled, but that was literally the argument.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.040
Very, very statistical.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.120
So there is an expert who says it's not coming. That was, that was the conclusion of the talk.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.360
He didn't really quite describe exactly what ML was going to eat as far as testing. Like,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.640
I think it's going to impact testing, but I don't think we're going to get rid of all testing

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.560
because ML can just, you just pointed ML algorithm at your app and it comes back and says green or

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.070
red. That would seem to violate the halting principle. So there are, and I'm going to

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:50.220
jump in because there is so much confusion mainly among testers. I'll say in the industry to be nice

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:57.500
around some around ML. I get everything from, uh, like what you said, it's not going to cut.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.470
Nothing's going to happen. I could ignore it. It's fine to thinking it's magic.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:08.230
I can just take my tests. I drop them into this ML app. I guess I say with eyes tweaked and rolled

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.430
and then the ML app spits out everything I need to know everything about my product is

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:21.190
high quality magic happens. And this, so I've heard both sides of that and DevOps is just crazy.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:26.150
I've heard it's not that difficult of a concept to understand, but I guess it's been,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.230
the word's been used in enough context that nobody knows what it means anymore.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.270
Right. Well, I think there's, there's a, there's a spectrum as far as I can tell,

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.710
reading the literature, which is not respected by a lot of people talking. So there's a spectrum

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.710
of operations, right? How do I maintain my service? Right. So there's what they traditionally

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.510
call service ops, which is I have a bunch of people who are not generally programmers who run

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:51.020
around and try with scripting and manual work to keep the service running. Right.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:57.420
I saw a post recently, um, from an unnamed tester talking about how the DevOps basically

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.260
paraphrased the DevOps concept was stupid because it just meant that dev and operations work

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.820
together and it should be called dev test PM ops or something. Cause everyone works together.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.380
Yeah. Cause that really rolls off the tongue. Yeah.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.820
It's not quite the point that's that happens. Yeah. There's just shut up.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.220
In my reading DevOps seems to be more like what I perceive as the Amazon model, which is you don't

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.380
have much of an ops team. You have a dev team and the dev team is on pager duty all the time to

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.780
keep your stuff running. And I go even farther going into the world of rent and I, and I would

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.180
say it's a world that favors specializing generals and generalizing specialists. Well,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.220
the better people that can do the operation stuff as well as the dev, as well as the QA and the test,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.660
whatever you want to call it. I think the issue, like I think I find this dev ops thing, uh,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:52.460
interesting because in the last few months I've seen a high spike in test leaders sort of

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.420
communicating or implying that that's the direction STEs are going. I think it's,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.340
I think people are caught up in the buzzword. People are. And that's, that was,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:10.150
that's my point. Like, uh, I think, I think you're right. Data science, uh, still today in a very

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:17.830
high degree is somewhat magical in terms of people's understanding. And I think DevOps is sort of the

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:26.150
same sort of thing. I think it's both of these terms have been blown up to some concept that's

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.510
not real in either case. Right. Well, we should finish the spectrum, right? There's the center of

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.710
the spectrum, which is what I believe Google uses, uh, which is called SRE or service reliability

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.630
engineering, which is basically you take a dev and you put them into the ops team and you tell them

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.990
how you have to spend half your time making the system better. In some ways, it's just like the

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:49.670
old world. You had your devs, which is your DevOps. You have your STEs, uh, or your software test

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.830
engineers, your manual testers, um, which are kind of your ops, your service ops. And then you

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.470
got SREs, which are kind of akin to your S debts. They're, you know, coding versions of

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:06.820
the service ops. Yeah. The, the thing I think about STEs moving into DevOps,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:16.060
to me, that kind of in some aspects makes sense. They're not actually DevOps, but I see a lot of

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:22.700
executives saying, Hey, I want to have one of these things too. And what we are observing,

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:30.460
I think is an executive point of view that essentially STEs are nothing but manual monkeys.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:37.500
And now we, we no longer need manual monkeys in the preventative world, but we do need them in

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.860
the service maintenance world. And I think that's not a terrible thought to go about, right? The,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.020
the difficulty is this, I think that you, and I noticed this tension at star, you have a certain

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.620
number of people that come from kind of a dev background, right? Those are your traditional S

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.100
debts or even devs that are, that are doing some testing. And then you have people that come from

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:03.580
the traditional STE manual testing background. And though some of those people for whatever reason,

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.380
because they, they find it difficult or because they choose not to have no sense of how to

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.940
program, right? They have no sense of how to, how to do a dev skill. And so they're kind of stuck

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.380
in a world where they want to find another world that also requires them to have that same,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.180
you know, kind of skill set. And without learning data science, which is a huge leap forward,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.300
or learning to program Python, which is again, a very difficult leap forward for,

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.620
to do it competently for, for a certain group of people, they need to find a world to live.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.780
And so part of star Canada was DevOps is the place you can go. And part of star Canada was

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:42.620
it's okay. ML and, you know, even test automation are not the right solution, right? The people

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.340
that are, there was literally a statement that said, you know, all thinking happens in testing and

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:52.060
not in automated testing. People who do automated testing aren't thinking was the implication.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.100
Yeah, that that's Alan's favorite checking versus testing.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.300
Stupid semantic arguments that mean nothing except for the people that invented them.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.700
So that was out loud. I think there is actually an interesting thing that happens here because

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.940
it's kind of a semantic argument, but it's not right. And so I was telling Brent about this,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:19.060
there's a, there's a logical fallacy called the mot and Bailey fallacy. So in Europe,

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.780
they used to have a castle on a hill, right? And that was called a mot, M O T T E, but it's just

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.940
a castle on the hill. And then around it, you had a much larger area that was fenced off. And

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.020
that's where everybody lived. And when the enemies came, you know, when the Germans or whatever came

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.620
to invade your area, you ran back to the castle and you defended your castle. And then

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.660
when you finally fought them off, you went back to your homes in the wider area.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.260
This is a logical fallacy that happens a lot where somebody makes a claim to a large area. And when

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.020
you attack it, they fall back to a very small area and then assume that they've defended the

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:53.380
large area by defending the small area. And so I had a conversation with one particular gentleman

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:58.100
who was attacking the concept of automated testing, using this checking versus testing,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.820
like check automated testing is only checking and nobody smart ever does that. And so I started

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.220
challenging him. He's like, Oh, no, no, test tools are fine to use in the appropriate place.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:12.740
Very small defensive situation. But then as soon as you let him go, he was back to like all automated

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.380
testing is a bunch of idiots. Well, the world is changing. I think people like I think a lot of

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:24.710
people and we've not to digress even farther, but a lot of testers, they don't want the world to

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.270
change. They're digging in, they're afraid of change. Star and other conferences are good for

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.590
that. They can see what kind of changes may happen. But it's unfortunate they see both.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.910
Like here's some changes that could happen. And the best people saying no, no, it's okay. Keep on doing

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.470
what you're doing. I think star would be better suited. And there was a lot of speakers here that

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:47.350
were this way. But I think more speakers should be here's how to move to the new world, as opposed to

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.070
here's a defense of your old world. It feels to me here's how to dig in and stay right where you

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.790
are because there's no need to move. You brought up the idea of specializing generalists and

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:02.470
generalizing specialists. I did just a few moments ago. And I actually think this type of stress

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:14.870
is cause when you have built your career around specialization and then that tombstones.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.710
I agree. And the point I would make is you go to these conferences, I think if what you take away

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.790
is all I need to do is keep on doing what I'm doing because nothing else needs to change.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:31.510
You've blown your opportunity of the conference. Your success anywhere in software, anywhere in

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:36.710
knowledge work requires that you continue to acquire new skills and learn new things.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:43.450
It doesn't have to be, I learned how to write in Python, but it does mean like, Oh, I know how to

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:49.130
make my testing a lot more efficient by creating a teeny little shell script. It sets up a Docker

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:54.330
container with our server on it. So I can do some quick testing much faster than I could before.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:59.290
For example, you need to, there's a hundred examples like that. You need to be able to

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:05.130
press F 12 in your browser on your web app and look at the traffic going on. And even if you don't

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.490
understand everything, understand like, Oh, that's probably bad. I should ask someone about that. You

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:18.710
need, you can't just do your exploratory human engaged. Don't call it manual testing because

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.590
it's, it kills a kitten. Yes. Every time you use the word manual testing, a kitten dies. I've been

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:34.260
told that manual testing, manual testing, manual testing, dog guy. So yeah. Uh, down from my soapbox,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:42.500
blood pressure calming to use a logical fallacy. I mean, I can't, like the Martin Bailey is okay.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:48.260
The Martin Bailey, right? The, that sounds like a brand of stout. It totally does. It totally does.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:56.820
Or, uh, yeah. Uh, a Scotch beer. The thing I've, I've heard just over and over again,

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:05.160
is that sort of fallacy around the discussion of whether or not test is dead or dying. Right. Um,

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:14.490
I, sure. So, so because we can find one example and I would say the medical industry is the most

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:23.450
common, commonly used one in, in defense. Hey, if it's essentially, if it can be proven that at least

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:31.050
one test job in the entire world is not under threat, therefore all of testing is not under threat.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:37.290
That's I think the Martin Bailey argument and it's wrong. Yeah. That very much is right. Like,

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.290
I think that all of testing is good. That's your Bailey. That's your large set. All manual

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.690
testing is good and you attack it. You're like, well, here's what it doesn't need it. Yeah,

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.210
but it's really needed for the medical industry. Okay. That's true. It's needed for the medical

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.410
industry. Therefore it's needed everywhere. And that's where the logical fallacy comes in. You've

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.250
only defended a small piece of turf and you're making a claim that you've defended a large one.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:59.050
And then usually my, my counter argument to this is I, I point people, all right,

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:05.530
let's go to monster.com and look up cold ball jobs. Hey, looks like they're still around.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.210
So we have what? Multiple millions. What would be our guest best estimate of,

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:18.490
of manual testers in the world right now? I don't know. Let's say 42, 42 million. It doesn't

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.170
matter. It's not a million. I definitely met more than 42 at, at Star Canada. So I think,

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:26.650
I think you're off by a little bit. So, so let's just say a million. I have no idea what that would

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:33.780
be though. It could be an interesting data question. 20, 30 years ago, about the same

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.060
cold ball programmers. Now go to monster.com and look how many of them are today. Yeah. They

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.820
still exist. Does that mean cold ball is a thriving business? I've been studying it at my

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.900
spare time. I think it's the future. Do you? Yeah. Really? Natural language programming.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:56.260
I'm not sure I like the metaphor. Um, but no, I just feel like a lot of the, the fallacies come

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:04.840
from a, this bias. This is, I, I like what I do. I don't want to change what I do. So I'm going

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.400
to look for it's confirmation bias. I'm going to look for things that support the fact,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.440
anything that support the fact that I don't want to change. I don't need to change.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.960
Right. And that's, this is natural, right? This goes back a long time in history, right? We have,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.720
when I impose a fallacy while I'm having another fallacy, is that fallacy inception?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.440
It could be. Okay. Just check it. Anyway, go on. That's going to a really weird spot. Um,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.540
so anyway, I mean, we have this, this story back in, I don't remember like the 1500s or whatever,

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.620
when they started coming up with automated looms, right? In order to do weaving and everybody who

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.020
had done weaving before was threatened by these automated looms. And so they started in some

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.580
towns in London or in England, they started smashing the looms, um, in order to defend them

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.740
because they were, they were bad for the human psyche and you know, and all that kind of stuff.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.660
Right. And today we, the guy who ran that was named Ludd and we call them Luddites,

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.460
right? And that's kind of not been generalized to anybody who's against technology.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.620
But really it's the same thing going on. Somebody's trying to defend their, you know,

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.380
their livelihood and make sure that it doesn't change, but you can't really stand in the way of

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.700
the freight train of the future coming. No. And, uh, maybe five years ago,

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.420
six years ago, somewhere back, there's a blog post on this. I did. Uh, I was driving into work

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.540
and there was a news article that Amazon was going to start use some robots to automate a

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:23.380
lot of their, uh, pick selection for shipping things and eliminate some human jobs. And

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:29.060
people were calling in just irate. They said, this is ridiculous. Taken away human jobs. You

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:34.340
know, this is, and I thought this is the same argument. This is stuff that is brain dead,

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.420
boring, easy to automate. Let's automate it. Let's use humans to actually think about

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.340
solving harder problems. When didn't Amazon just announced they have something like 500,000

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.780
employees. So clearly it didn't cost that many jobs. I saw an advertisement around it being

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:54.820
pick season now. And, uh, they, Amazon's doing ads on TV saying, Hey, it's pick season. We want

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.500
to hire a whole bunch of folks. They still need season because the robots can't keep up. It's not

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:04.340
doesn't make sense to invest in enough robots to, uh, optimize for peak season for pick season

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:09.140
for holidays. Peak peak. I think you're right. I think it's very similar in the world of,

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.980
of testing, right? Where there are things like Brent talked about medical devices and probably

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.700
planes and some other things where, um, you know, the, the, the economics or the situation

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.900
require that you go and do this kind of stuff. I don't think manual testing is ever going to go

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.660
away, but it's going to become more and more limited in where it is necessary to apply.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:32.420
I agree. And then, and then to the people, um, who have neophobia, which is the fear of new

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:39.380
allows the fear of, uh, Keanu Reeves. I have that. Yeah. Different thing. Um,

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:45.860
those who have neophobia, like even in that world, when it shrinks and, and yeah, it's sure

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:51.830
there's going to be a world where manual testing specialists still have jobs, but it's going to

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:58.550
be the best of the best who have them. So I look at my team, Alan talks about working in unity.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:07.350
So I have 40 people ish on my team. Uh, I, let me count in my head. I have one, two,

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:21.060
just one, Brent, just one, one, two, three, four, five. I think five are air quote STEs,

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.060
meaning they don't actually, they all know how to code a little bit into a lot. Uh, one of them

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.660
is a game developer. The value they, they are the best of the best, the value they, they're all

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.020
fantastic. Well, I respect the other people making, not just like pushing, like,

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:41.380
I don't want to equate the manual tester to, or the STE to pushing buttons, but they,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.180
they're, they most of them function like little mini test managers for me. They're making sure

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.260
the whole product was put together, right? They're doing, they're doing all of the

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.060
organizational work for their feature areas. Pretty much, uh, they're keeping their features

00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.020
and products running. It's a, it's a, it's a not an entry level rule by any means.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.140
Well, I think that there's, there's a difference between what that kind of, uh, manual tester

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.540
does exploratory kind of manual tester and what most manual testers, most of Brent's million,

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.260
actually ended up doing like most of the million manual testers end up doing the same thing

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.940
every day over and over again. And it really, it's not a whole lot different than pushing a

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.300
button and, you know, getting a piece of candy out of the bottom of it. Right. I mean, you're,

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.700
some people call them monkey testers and I don't mean to demean it, but I think that sometimes you

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.620
get put in that position where, where that's what you do. I was in a position at one point in time

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.820
where I spent, you know, all day running the same test that I ran the day before,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.940
which are the same tests we ran the day before, just to make sure that the newest version of,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:41.700
at this point, windows 98 didn't break. So let me dive deeper into, I get up on a soapbox again,

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:48.660
because it's fun is a big part of their job is managing not in traditional sense. I'll use a

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.380
different word, uh, dealing, communicating with people are on people around the team,

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.220
around the company to help unity product overall. You're talking about your, your five SCs. Yeah.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:04.260
Yeah. They do a lot of communication, talking developers, talking to their testers, coordinating.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:11.940
Uh, we don't have very many, uh, what are our PMs called product managers? I was joking with the

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.980
interview Canada this week. I don't know. I'm just going to call you a PM because I don't know

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.180
whether you're a product manager, a project manager or program manager. I don't even know the

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.500
difference in some cases, but we don't have very many product managers. So these SDEs do a lot of

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.620
that coordination, making sure the right things are happened, making sure the right people are

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:31.860
thinking about things. And the reason I bring that up is I do hear again, some of the digging

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:36.340
in my heels, uh, test is not changing. Don't worry about it. Don't worry. You worry your pretty

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:43.620
little heart. Uh, people, I hear them say comments like, uh, they're very much in this world of,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:48.020
see how you can describe this without sounding too stupid testing as information provider,

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.340
which we've raked on before. They say, okay, you fat is a problem in your system.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.060
That's all you have to do is report that it's at the management now to figure out what to do.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.180
One thing, and this is even true at Microsoft, don't, don't pick on you too much, but

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.740
if you defer every little gripe you have to management to solve the problem for you,

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.620
like mom and dad, they're not playing right.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.620
You have to play together nicely. It's my order.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.260
They just be friends. Yeah. Uh, this is one of the places where,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.220
I mean, in that particular one, this is one of the places where I firmly stand behind

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:31.580
ML is going to eat that job. Right. MML stats work. It doesn't take a lot of effort

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:40.180
to automate information providing in that regard. Right. Sure. The, there's going to be,

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:45.540
there's going to be some challenge around context sensitivity, but you have the right team coming

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:52.260
and put things in place. The PM himself can, can put that to add that additional context.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.820
Do not need a full time man or a monkey to do it.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.940
Yeah. And I don't think it's actually the ML is solving the problem for you. I think it's that we

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:02.180
can build tooling that allows you to self-service much better, right? Once upon a time, you know,

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:07.540
every executive in America had a secretary whose job it was to type for them nowadays.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:12.820
Everybody who's even CEOs know how to type, right? Like we've made that job obsolete because we taught

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.820
it to the, you know, to the other person. I think to some extent there's a job of go get me the

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.220
data that I need or go find out how the situation is. And the more we can build tools to expose

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.740
that better, the more somebody in the PM job or the more somebody in the C, you know, the

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.420
manager job can just go find for themselves what that is. And they don't have to have somebody to

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.940
go interpret for them. I think there are a lot of unknown unknowns in this, in this growth path

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:41.540
where if you don't know anything about how the program works or how to write code,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:46.020
you may not realize that this boring thing you do every day could be easily automated.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.420
Where we've grown out of that world a little bit. And now we're into with this new world

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.660
of data and machine learning. Often we don't know, Alice is really hard to figure out.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.020
I don't know how I'm, I'll just, it's just hard. I can't do it, but we don't know.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.620
They don't know, or we don't know that, Oh, actually this is a problem that can be solved

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.580
given the right skillset and tools. So I think we're growing into the world where we need to,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.580
or a lot of us need to figure out like when we have these hard problems,

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.660
there's actually a way to solve them where we might think there isn't a way to solve them.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.060
And the thing that I think the rest of us have to be sensitive to is that this does,

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:25.060
when we make these easier to solve, we do displace people, right? There's a different

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.580
kind of job that takes a different kind of skillset. And so some people that were not

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.100
well suited before now become well suited. And other ones that were well suited to that particular

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.540
skillset are less well-suited to the new one. Which is another reason to be the specializing

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:42.660
generals. Cause as part of my job becomes obsolete, it doesn't matter because I have so

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:48.820
many other things I can do when you can only do one thing and that one thing becomes

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.500
not necessary anymore, you're screwed. But you did that to yourself.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.900
Right. And that's why I think conferences like Star and other large test conferences have a very

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:01.300
big opportunity, which is to help people cross that chasm, right? Help them get the new skillset.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.020
And there were a lot of talks that were attempting to go do that, but there was other talks,

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.180
even some of the keynotes that seemed to be more like, the sky's not falling, everything's

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.180
okay, everybody on the other side are idiots. You know, like there's no thinking involved in

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.500
automated testing. And so you don't have to move forward. And what they don't realize is

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.700
that if you go back to kind of the history of testing that I gave at the beginning,

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.180
and that we gave a lot of detail when we talked about it before, in quotes, I really drink.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.300
When you go back to that, there's kind of a progression, right? You start at manual

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.780
testing and then you move to automated testing and then you move to, you know, potentially test

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:41.300
writing themselves. But then you move on to some kind of ML statistical based stuff that

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.100
tells you your quality. And they're kind of fighting the war between the first and the second,

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.900
not realizing the world's even moved beyond the second one. Like automated testing is not the thing

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.700
that I think is the solution for most people's problems today.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.930
I don't disagree with that. Yeah. In fact,

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.770
that's actually an interesting insight though. That's what I was thinking through.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.970
But let me, I'm going to interrupt because that's, that plays right into something I've told

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.490
my team before. And I mentioned here before is I said, I want you,

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:15.050
the people in QA roles on my team, I'm going to change their titles.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:21.700
I haven't told my team that I don't follow that out or not, but I've asked them to write

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:28.500
fewer tests. Please stop writing so many tests, development team help them write more tests,

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:33.220
more unit tests, more integration tests. There's just so many other things I want to do other than

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:41.110
write any tests. Yeah. You're basically saying, Hey, look guys, very little value proposition

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:46.070
in you doing this work for the dev team now. Everybody knows there's more work to do than

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:50.470
they can do as far as choosing what to do, deprioritize writing tests.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:53.190
And that doesn't mean that we're saying that tests are bad, right?

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.990
Right. Exactly.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.390
Checks are bad. What we're saying. Shut up.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.630
But what we're saying is that automated tests are more efficiently written by the person

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.630
writing the code. Yes.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:08.790
Yeah. No, but the insight I'm still puzzling through that I think Steve is absolutely right on.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:18.540
Right. I think it's very literally what you're saying is that Star Canada, you observed traditionalists

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:26.060
fighting against the modernist testing. Modern guys are going, what the hell are you talking about?

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:34.150
You're holding on to 1996 principles and ideals. We've moved two decades beyond that.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:38.470
We don't care about those problems anymore. Whereas the traditional are still going,

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.030
what are you talking about? Medical still does.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:47.270
Well, we have a bit of a problem because our audience, the three people that listen to this

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:55.780
podcast all get that they all know that they need to be learning new things and trying new ideas

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:04.540
is how do we reach, how does the industry reach the other people? And conferences should be a great

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.580
way to do that. But I think you get out what you put into the conference and you have to go into

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:14.940
the conference with the idea that you will take away new ideas you want to try. If all you take

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:20.620
away is justification that you don't need to change, that's a frightening waste of time and

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:27.530
scares me. Well, I think it's difficult for a conference designer, right? Somebody's setting up

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:32.090
a conference to figure out what the right balance is. Because if you tell your audience that this

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.450
job is going away and this conference is designed around a particular job and now there's only

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.610
going to be a handful of you and so we're going to have one conference of 50 experts once a year,

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:44.570
that kind of makes your conference go away. And other people have conferences in other areas.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:48.250
So it can be a little difficult to figure out what the right balance is. Your audience kind

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:53.050
of wants to hear their jobs okay. So there's a sense of I want to reaffirm what your current

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:57.450
beliefs are. And there's also a sense of I need to challenge. And so if you challenge too much,

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:01.130
you'll just cause them to reject you and go to the other place where they're being given

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.050
defense. If you're a star and you say, all right, we're going to tell you all that you need to

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.490
change immediately, this is all wrong, people are going to stop going to your conference,

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.770
they're going to go to whatever the other big testing conferences are.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:21.820
So it's interesting. In retrospect, I see this trend ever since however long it's been. Six years

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:28.730
ago when Whitaker said test is dead, is that there's always one talk, one keynote at a

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:35.140
conference talking about test is alive and well. And so it's interesting that I think

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.380
that split might have started then where it's about here's all the way it's changing and not

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.220
going to be what it used to be. And the half talks going, no, no, no, it's still going to

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.020
always be the same as it used to be. This is what we need. Have you seen this obscure bug

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:53.060
I found in my flight tracking app where it gives me an error message that doesn't make as much

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:57.060
sense as it should. This is why we need software testers. Right now, I think that

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.180
the conversation is going on in the large, right? Because I saw a lot of people at this

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.860
conference that were responding back to whatever the last star conference was. I don't know if

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:09.350
it's star west or star east. West is in the fall. So west must have just happened.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.590
So it must have been just west. And apparently the keynote at west was ML is coming to eat your

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:18.310
jobs. And so clearly that conference was definitely talking about at least some of

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.990
this modern stuff. And then this conference to some extent was some of the speakers were

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.670
a reaction to that, right? And so there was a very extreme statement made on one side.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.870
And so that kind of engenders an extreme statement on the other side. And the reality is

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:36.140
probably as usual somewhere in the middle. So I've done this. It literally takes

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:46.540
30 seconds on Google Scholar searching for software testing and machine learning

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:58.500
to see what people are doing with ML in the test context and what they're succeeding on

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:04.410
and what they're failing on. And I will tell you, big hint, they're succeeding more than

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:12.890
they're failing on this front. It is for certain building up momentum. If you looked at the rate

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:20.250
which studies of these sort are coming in, you can see that they're rapidly accelerating

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:29.610
year over year. In my view, it is much like when Alan and I started this within Microsoft,

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:38.940
God, four or five years ago, where to us it was very clear, no, this is coming. There's nothing

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:46.620
that can stop this momentum. You can choose to put your head in the sand like an ostrich,

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:58.010
or you can heed our warning. I now feel like one of those men with the signs in the middle of

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:02.250
New York, the end is nigh, right? You got your little bull out on the street corner.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.410
Yeah, I heard they're very effective. You could hear, you could heed our warning and start

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:12.330
prepping because there is still time. But I definitely see worldwide things starting to

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:19.980
shape up in terms of how we saw them at Microsoft just a few years ago. The test singularity

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.220
is literally just a matter of time, in my humble opinion.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:30.330
I think that's probably over claiming things. I think that a lot of the AI ML people come out

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.490
and say, it's going to solve all problems everywhere. And I think there are limits to the kind of

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:37.850
techniques we have today. There was just one of the big pioneers, I forget the name I was looking

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:42.970
for it and I can't find it, who came out not long ago at a conference and said, back propagation and

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:46.730
what we call deep neural networks have a limit. And in order to get to the next level, we're going

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.530
to have to invent a new technique that's not been invented yet. So I think there's-

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:57.290
No, they're going to have limits, but I don't see a manual tester being the-

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.410
The solution? No, I don't either.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:06.410
Solution to working around. And then so we see a momentum around testing effort being moved to dev,

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:12.170
what we traditionally classify as testing effort moving to dev. And then a large portion of these

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:21.130
hard thinking problems moving to AI. So then the question in my view is, sure, AI is not going to

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:27.050
solve everything. Those of us in the business know what it can do really well and what it

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:32.680
can't do really well. But what piece of the pie does that leave over for the manual?

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:39.160
Is it just pacemakers? Well, I think that the pacemakers are definitely a big part of what's

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.960
left for manual testers. I think there's two places where manual testing will continue to thrive.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.320
I think one is in the industries that can't ship very quickly for whatever reason, either

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.800
the cost of getting it wrong is insanely high, so pacemakers, nuclear power, airplanes. And then

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:01.400
I think that the other spot are places where it's economically- your product is small enough and

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.400
has a short enough shelf life that it is not worth building an automated system for.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.440
Or even small enough and doesn't matter if it sucks enough. I'm thinking of IT internal apps

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.040
and reflecting on my time at Microsoft using those that quality obviously isn't a high concern.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.200
Think of a lot of web apps that show up on an iPhone or an Android or whatever. A lot of those

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:25.960
are a low cost, one or two person system. Building up a team to do data to understand how

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.760
this thing's working doesn't make sense until you get to a certain scale.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.920
But I don't think those- I don't think that those are trapping that happens manually.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.800
I don't think the teams that you're describing will go with the AI. I think it's more like,

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:44.200
again, there's two things that threatening the manual testing. Agile and AI. And I think

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.960
that small IT shop, they're far more likely to go, no, whatever testing skills our devs have,

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.480
that's good enough. Ship it.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.920
Yes, I think that's correct. What I did see actually interesting at Star, I met a couple

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.480
of people that were actually devs from a traditional Agile dev shop who were at Star to try to learn

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:05.800
how to think like a tester. Which I think you'll see more and more people that need that skill set.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.960
Yeah, there should be conferences more dedicated to that. Because I don't think

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.800
going to a traditional test conference like Star or STP is the best way for a developer

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.600
to learn more about testing. I think there could be a more dedicated conference. I think

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.280
the Agile conference is- what's the big one called? Totally spacing.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.240
I don't know.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.360
Anyway, the big Agile conference, like 20 concurrent tracks,

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.120
does have tracks on that. But I think that may need to wrap up.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:40.630
One thing I want to point out and solicit information from you guys on is,

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:47.830
I'm actually going to Star East in May. I'm only giving a tutorial on tools for testers.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:52.150
This is sort of an extension, the deep dive extension of my technical testing talk,

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:59.820
where I'm going to take four hours and teach a room of people or two people, whoever show up,

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:05.420
how to use things like Docker, some basic shell scripting, a little bit of PyTest, F12 debugger.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.740
I'm wondering now, I don't have anything- and again, this is allotted,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.140
this is going to get an overview in a couple hours. Is there anything on the data or ML side I should

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.340
shove a little demo in of?

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:22.620
The hard part is getting a world where they can bootstrap it. The hard part about data is that

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.140
it requires a big infrastructure. Now, there are things, I'm sure there's competitors to it as

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:30.060
well, but there's things like app insights from Microsoft over in the Visual Studio land, where

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.660
you can instrument your code and it automatically sends it to the backend and then you can use

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:38.300
it to analyze data. So showing off something like that would be useful, whether it's app insights or

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.500
whether it's one of the competitors.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.660
New Relic is a competitor of that.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:50.060
So is app insights available in versions of Visual Studio non-Microsofties like me can use,

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.340
or do I have to have the enterprise version?

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.660
I have no idea what the licensing for it looks like. I don't think it's actually-

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.500
I don't think it's Visual Studio, I think it's a separate thing that you guys-

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.300
Well, take a look at it.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:58.700
I believe.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.220
So it works well with Visual Studio, but it's an Azure offering.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:12.330
All right, I'll take a look at it. I may just do some demos. We have a data pipeline that has a

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:16.650
tool called Presto on top, which is basically straight SQL queries into your data that are

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.450
pretty fast. So I could set up something like that.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:23.930
So the advantage of app insights or one of those systems is that you don't have to create the

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.850
system for your app to talk back to the cloud. You don't have to create the system

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.610
like the database. You just basically, you put some instrumentation in your code and it

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.530
magically shows up in a database. And then you can query that database or even use their UI to

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:40.410
get visuals on it. And so the hard part is the infrastructure in between, right? There's the magic

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:45.450
between my code says, person click this button and something in the cloud knowing that the button

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.410
got clicked.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:47.450
I actually think-

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:48.250
And it solves that problem.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:56.570
The thing I've been thinking around on this topic is the way to enter into this if you're a

00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:02.730
tester. And I've been thinking through, I'm quite overloaded at the moment, so I couldn't do this

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:10.970
probably until, begin to do this until Christmas. But I'm thinking a context sensitive training on

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:16.490
EDA for tester would be useful in this context.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.050
For our audience, EDA is exploratory data analysis.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.810
This is using graphs and charts to understand what your graphically,

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:26.330
visually what your data looks like rather than just coming up with summary numbers.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:31.930
So one of the things I talked about several episodes ago, and I'm fairly certain that I

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:38.330
could do this, I could probably pull together a whole, at least an hour conversation on

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.350
analyzing histograms.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.110
It sounds thrilling.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:46.710
No, I know it would be boring as all hell, but-

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.470
Oh my God, I get some popcorn.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.550
But histograms-

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:54.120
It's almost as good as the new Star Wars movie.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.560
Are you going somewhere? Because I have things to say.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.360
Yeah, go ahead.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:04.730
Two things. I remember being in, you might have been there, Steve, early in the days of

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.810
Windows data science, there were a bunch of people got together weekly to try and figure

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:15.450
out what the hell it meant. And I remember at first, and it was part of the growing pains,

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:19.770
not picking up on it. At first it was like, how can we recreate our old test dashboards using

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:23.130
data? And then I remember pushing-

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.730
What did the dashboards use before?

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.180
Using customer data versus test data.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.580
Got it.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:36.340
Because we need dashboards. And I remember pushing hard on the fact that I don't give

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:40.580
a crap about, I give a little bit of a crap, but exploring that data is much more interesting

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.180
because those insights are addictive and I want to get those insights being able to explore the

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:50.020
data. One thing I should mention, one point, different point completely is in talking,

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.620
I realized app insights, do the stuff, magic is done for you. I may just write a Unity app

00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:02.180
because we ship what's called Unity Analytics. It's a server, a service customers can use,

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:08.260
which is basically that for you. In fact, we'll add app start, app stop, and a few other things

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.620
automatically for you. If you choose to just click the button for the service,

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:16.340
then you can add other things and get all kinds of interesting information and have it show up on

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.260
your developer dashboard. That's essentially the app insights paradigm.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.060
Yeah, that sounds like a very specialized version of the app insights world.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:28.740
Yeah. So I may do that. I'm trying to figure if I want how much of the tutorial I want to be

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.220
interactive versus demo, that would be a little bit too- I think actually if I'm going to do

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.220
anything with data, it's probably going to be demo versus interactive.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:41.300
The hard part is getting enough, getting somebody to stand up enough site licenses or

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.820
whatever it is in order to let everybody access that data, right?

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.300
It's free.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.110
But you'd have to have a lot of instances for them to come access it or something.

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.590
You could give them access potentially to a demo data source.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.710
Yeah, I'll think about that.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.990
But I think that's the important part. If you want to show it off, the hard part is not

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.310
connecting those two pieces. Let somebody who specializes in that do that. The part that the

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.070
testers need to learn is once I have the data, what do I do with it?

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.790
Well, the way I would spin it is-

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:10.550
How do I look at it? How do I interpret it?

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.750
That is useful.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:19.050
How can I do testing via this data? How can I tell for a given use case or scenario,

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.570
how many people are successful doing it when they're not? What errors are they seeing?

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:28.120
Then you could talk through a lot of the problems, the fallacies that end up happening in there.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.440
If you have two different populations, one's moving really fast, one's moving really slow.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.480
If you just look at the average, you'll assume that everybody lives somewhere in the middle

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.680
where the reality is nobody's living in the middle. Or if it fails in a certain way,

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:45.720
you can have survivorship biases where everybody who fails stops using it,

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.760
everybody who doesn't fail keeps using it. Most of your users are successful,

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.560
even though most people who tried it are unsuccessful.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:58.360
Yes. That's that path of insights I love to find out. You find a little bit of data that looks

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.200
interesting and you go, oh, I wonder why that is? Let me poke a little deeper. Oh,

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:08.200
well, okay. Now I know. One more question I want to ask. Oh, crap. I love doing that.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:13.700
Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I think there is a space for the dashboards as well. I think you want to

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:19.140
understand, at a baseline, am I in general in good shape? And then what are the special questions?

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:25.300
I'm not entirely against dashboards. I just want to avoid what I think is maybe a natural progression

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:32.180
of if you say we're going to test using data now to replace your test automation dashboard

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:35.620
with a similar dashboard showing test from customer data.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:46.540
I mean, that actually is a good start. I will say that's a good start. It is not a destination.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.400
But just to see what the difference is in terms of the tool that you're accustomed to before,

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:59.000
and but now getting this data from a new source. So that means that people are going to be,

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:05.530
they're going to have an old process, but new data. So it should help move things forward.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:09.610
But it's not where you should stop. I think you have to give people a path to the new world.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.530
If you just say there's a new world and don't be in your old world anymore, go.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:16.970
It's very disconcerting and people don't know how to move forward. Yeah. Give them a path.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.650
That's an evolutionary path forward, not a revolution.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:26.810
I agree. And a totally different situation, dealing with one fun challenge at work now where we

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:34.970
have a generic sizing. There's a team, not part of my team, who absolutely knows where they want to go.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:40.650
I am not convinced yet they have any idea how to get there. So it's fun. I like it.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:44.650
Yeah. That can be very disconcerting because it's very easy to give up or to go back because

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.970
you didn't get there yet. And so clearly it's the wrong place to go, which isn't necessarily true.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:56.810
Well, it's been, do we even announce what number episode this was or were we too excited about

00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:04.970
Steve being here? We did not. I'm just that excited. We definitely were excited about Steve being here,

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:14.330
but this now closes out episode number 70. Episode 70. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And I'm Steve. See you next time.
