00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.020
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.860
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.220
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hello Brent hello are you

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.390
ready for the last episode of a B testing for a while I am NOT but it is

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.870
what it is it is what it is and if you're listening out of order go back

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.590
listen to last we'll talk more about it later we're taking a break for a while

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.320
while I go off and become consciously homeless but more on that later more on

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.200
that later Brent has been so long since we last recorded yeah what have you been

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:02.510
up to since the last time we talked I did some work think of anything in ADO I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.430
pulled some weeds in my back nice yeah yeah that's about it all right yeah we

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.110
recorded Friday I just released that episode today and we're recording now on

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.470
Monday to come out on what day right today's episode listening do you

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.760
listening this comes off the press it is what day April 4th and what is the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.570
significance of April 4th for for common very important day in the history of

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.090
the world or not it is the 11th anniversary of the first a B testing

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.020
podcast that is right congratulations us we are 11 yeah 10 more years and we get

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.420
free beer forever and if we live it's almost if you take take the podcast age

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.180
and convert it to dog years yeah it's it's almost your age right shut the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:10.220
front door okay whatever I haven't done anything either some hike prep stuff

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.620
we'll talk about that later yeah but you know if you want to get into it do you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:32.540
want to get into it yes welcome to the last mailbag of 2025 we got we have a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.740
mailbag question should we do our prediction episode now because I won't

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.860
I'll be back I'll be back in September if all goes well I'll barely be gone is

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.980
that your prediction that you'll be back in September that's my prediction okay I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.820
got fingers crossed this is episode 219 to one nine two one nice to 19 a prime

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.560
number let's think about that no idea okay

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.200
Laszlo no probably not I think that's right Laszlo Farkas says hey Alan and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.080
Brent spelled our names right and everything awesome hey last little

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.800
questions here is one quite complex one but it cannot be a problem for you

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.580
probably we're not that smart what's your opinion on the strategic role of

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.100
quality what's the role contribution of quality into product strategy what's the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.260
value of quality in general or product quality particularly can offer to say

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.340
cultures primarily for customers and business can product quality be a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.900
competitive advantage yes can the quality of the product support the product

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.460
strategy of the given product can we charge higher prices if we improve

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.420
product quality can we customers really compare quality of our product

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.340
competitors products is quality just a cost or does quality generate profit do

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.660
you have examples for cloud projects where quality is a competitive

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.780
advantage who good context from software development organization point of view

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.900
cloud enterprise product quality strategy creation thank you it claims to

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.220
the fourth listener but that's not true because there are only three I have so

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.500
much to say but I'm gonna I didn't know where to start but Brent let's go

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.900
question by question okay what value what value the quality in general or

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.020
product quality particularly can offer the stakeholders primarily for customers

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:27.020
and business go ahead oh it just defer to me yeah let's do this I'll ask the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.940
question then you answered then you can do all the work oh I did all the work

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.960
class episode no you didn't I did I so did I don't remember that so what's you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.740
want to start with the bullet points or there's also the bullet points is what's

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.020
your opinion on the strategic role of quality but okay what value what

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:00.580
strategically evaluating the strategic role of quality is important yeah so

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.940
let me think for a minute I this is around quality and product strategy why

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.780
are you going so did you not have coffee yet today and actually no oh that might

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.160
be it yeah so you might have to boot start me here but I'm remembering this

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:30.830
ties into you know principle one I wrote an article once I probably can't

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.670
dig it out right now on because everybody talks about the cost of quality

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.080
and I think if you're thinking about the cost of quality you're doing it wrong

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.360
because quality is a competitive advantage so the question that second

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.000
blood point up ahead can product quality be competitive advantage absolutely yes

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.360
yes yes yes but is it not necessarily correct all right yeah all right let's go

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.600
back to the first bullet get me started here what value I'm trying to

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.920
grok the question what value the quality in general or product quality

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.510
particularly can offer the stakeholders so what is the value of quality though

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:15.010
the same yeah but particularly for stakeholders primarily customers and

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:22.210
business well the business obviously the business cares because the customers

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:30.940
care right so to me it's the same answer there right quality is in part

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.260
cost and quality isn't I don't understand how you tricked me into making me go

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:44.300
first on answering this question sneaky evil bastard we go the I go back to

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:57.460
Weinberg right now I also I also want to be very clear here on my opinion a lot

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.540
of people when they come and talk to me about quality they mean bugs oh and

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.180
this is actually no we can get in here right because this is implying and a lot

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.260
of the cost of quality stuff so it equates quality with testing and quality is not

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:21.900
testing qualities outcomes in quality is not bugs definitely not but bugs can

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:32.390
be anti or an anti pattern for quality well for customers and we can go back to

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.910
Weinberg it's a value right in person but it's such a I love the answer but

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:43.470
it's not enough well so okay what are the benefits of there's two definitions

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:49.740
of quality that we can operate here like one is the presence of bugs to what's

00:07:49.740 --> 00:08:04.230
that bullshit okay now I can quality there was I also wrote an article on

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:09.750
around this a long time ago and I'm pretty certain that it brought up the

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:23.110
the chairs example here right ultimately quality I will say in our in our

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:31.450
relationship paused episode I guess I'll repeat Tom poppin likes point of view

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:39.580
which is when I share very strongly the true definition of quality is well

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:46.600
actually what his quote is most people forget no one wants software their

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.760
problem solved they want the problem solved so quality in a nutshell is to

00:08:52.760 --> 00:09:00.900
degree you can solve someone's problem without bolting on additional baggage

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:09.860
yeah I like it and and you can even go further like you can solve their problem

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:19.250
and then some right so if I offer you a chair right I can give you you know the

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:25.970
standard kids table chair the little fold up little metal thing that's like

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:31.650
does its purpose but not the world's most comfortable one or you know I could

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:38.730
offer you the plush leather one that has the you know cup holders everywhere and

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:46.170
massages your back and even you sink into it like falling into a pillow right

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:52.450
both offer the ability to sit on right but one's gonna be viewed as a higher

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:59.730
quality because it offers a better experience and offering and so when I

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:09.900
look at quality can offering your customer a better experience be a

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:20.150
competitive advantage yes can offer I'm actually testing if I can answer all of

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.220
his questions just by changing the word product to better experience right and I

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:31.180
think I can't what value does a better experience in general or product quality

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:37.910
particularly offer well a lot right number one is the competitive edge and then as

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.990
long as you're focused on are you actually solving the customer's problems

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:47.070
without bringing along additional baggage then sure can product quality be a

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:55.300
competitive advantage yeah let me let me dive into that one cuz that one I can

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:02.180
give some examples and this goes back to it's not bugs product zero bugs is not

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.700
a competitive advantage it means you're delivering too slow actually if you

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:18.650
try and have zero bugs so there are businesses that have used quality attributes

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:24.250
whether it's resiliency reliability trust that have made that are a competitive

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.350
advantage stripe for example comes to mind

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:36.280
Brett name me another company that that is known for their payment system pay

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.280
not quite the same but it even works with stripe I think stripe are are a

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:49.320
leader because they are performant and reliable it almost always works sure

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.520
stuff sure stuff can happen but it it's relied on by thousands and thousands of

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.280
companies small companies around the globe and they made a business around

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.800
quality it just it just works and now because I said that somebody will tell

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:10.450
me that oh didn't work for me blah blah blah but I think you could even say I

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:17.700
would even throw Azure in here Azure AWS Google the cloud the three big cloud

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.300
platforms they are competitive with each other because their trustworthy they're

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.300
could their AWS had a big outage years ago but they've been rock-solid ever

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:33.170
since and that yes there are obstacles to get in the way but I would say that

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:41.330
they're their crowd quality crowd strike impacted all of them yeah okay not fair

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.850
then but but you can see I'm trying to think of some examples of where

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:51.100
companies have done well because their shit just works and maybe maybe the

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.500
cloud platforms are hard but stripe I would do maybe even like data dog I

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.820
would do because they make a product that's around reliability and

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.940
observability and I think they actually keep it oh sure sure it's just

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.540
software that just there is stuff out there that just works when you need it to

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:13.540
and that is an event that's why you don't go to the it's really hard for others to

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.500
break into the markets those folks are in because they have so much of a

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.860
competitive advantage in the quality and feature set they solve the customers

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:29.550
problems in a way that they can trust is reliable and is easy to use so yeah

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:35.810
absolutely a competitive advantage yeah that's my opinion mine too all right

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:44.220
don't go on yeah I was just loading up so the next question is how can the quality

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:55.670
of product support the product strategy of the given product okay I'm gonna

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:06.730
choose to rephrase that as for a given product is its quality important for

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:18.080
product strategy right marketing sales feature development in there I would say

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:28.860
yes to all of them right the when I look at that and I go okay many of these

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.780
questions I think I'm thinking how I'm gonna go deeper but many of these

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:47.810
questions I just want to load up principle five right if if you if you

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:56.790
understand your customer then they're going to drive the direction around how

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.910
important quality is to that strategy certain things like you bring up you

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:12.740
brought up the cloud but there's other there's other things along those lines

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:22.830
as well like how important how important is the water company's definition of

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:32.450
quality to their product strategy electricity gas like anything that's a

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:42.470
utility you really can't differentiate right it's it's well water you probably

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:49.860
could but electric company the quality there I guess is really important right

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:58.130
the for example where I live all the wires are underground which means I'm

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:06.520
resilient to to blackouts I still get them but we're much more resilient which

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.430
is nice right not having blackouts is better than having blackouts I agree

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:19.910
wait well to a point like it's fun having a little family adventures and

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:34.520
downstairs but can buds so bugs in the electric in the electrical grid yeah that

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.880
would be pretty bad because what's one of the like what is the customer

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:46.540
expectation of electricity but it's there it's there I plug in it works right

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.920
dude good let me I'm gonna stir this in a different way because I agree with all

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.580
that but the context is from software development organization point of view

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.340
cloud enterprise I think with cloud here and so what I see this question

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.910
I'll paraphrase it how does product quality support product strategy and I

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:13.010
think the key if I think about this you know if I'm wrong I think quality goes go

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:18.490
back to Brian Finster's comment around you know to find the bottlenecks new

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.850
system trying to CD I think product product quality enables product velocity

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:29.890
and then as you know when you can reduce your what principles this we can

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:37.040
reduce our feedback loops we can solve customers problems if we're able to

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.720
reduce our feedback loops we can solve our customers problems faster and more

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:47.430
efficiently what do you mean by reduce our you mean the time time I call time

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.550
okay like I'm like reduce our feedback loops why would we ever reduce our

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.110
people want them to be so because they'd be faster if the strategy is

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:00.950
quality then we are able to ship faster which enables us to deliver more

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.790
quality which enables us to ship faster and and that's true of both

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:14.930
definitions of quality whether it be bugs right I'm not a believer in over

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:22.780
act or in my view overreacting around oh we must prevent every bug possible okay

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:29.780
in most products but some products right just as I mentioned earlier it's the

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.300
ability that it solves a customer problem without bringing any additional baggage

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:40.760
yeah right in electric company if it brought additional baggage that gets

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:48.070
annoying right if if every day I plug in a new lamp I even if it's only for a few

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:54.340
milliseconds like my house has a brand out that would be annoying right um

00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:02.340
would we survive in off of that sure sure can we charge higher prices if we

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:09.960
improve product quality uh for a cloud enterprise product absolutely yeah

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:16.020
absolutely and like you can't I mean to be clear you can't say here's our buggy

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.460
version of our product but you for five dollars more a month you can get our

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.580
better less buggy version that would never work right but again so higher

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:30.670
prices to improve product quality again can you charge it for having you can you

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.790
if if you had two products that solved the customer's problem exactly the same

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:40.620
way but one was buggier no but that's not the way you do it you have maybe you

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.580
have two products that work the same the the free version the enterprise

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.380
version what you get with the enterprise version is guaranteed uptime

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:53.820
SLAs you know more observability or auditing you those are the things

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.980
companies will give you in their paid version even if it's the same as the

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:09.720
free version yes and no right there it debates like I would say yes if we do

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.960
with customer if we go with quality with the previous definition the degree we

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:20.220
solve a customer's problem absolutely right you're your freemium one solves

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:25.140
the problem for you know follows the 8020 rule the premium the freemium one

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:33.420
solves you know the basic problem for 60% and then other folks have additional

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.770
nuance to the solution that they desire yeah you can charge higher prices for

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:47.950
that I don't know I don't know if it would be a good business strategy to to to

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.710
change the reliability of it but you wouldn't change the reliability we're

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:58.910
giving is a promise what quality gives you it's not you can't charge more for

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:05.350
it but it's directly but it's love its pricing leverage I do think if you can

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.270
make give SLAs or promise uptimes with some sort of cashback or discounts or

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:15.150
credits or whatever that you can back up with quality by all means you can

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:22.900
charge more we have a feature called spot VMs in Azure okay and the spot

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:31.740
VMs what we do is so it probably doesn't surprise you just like the electrical

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:38.500
company like the amount of compute needs goes up and down with day and

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:44.260
nighttime as well as throughout the week right people don't have a tendency to

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.940
need them at nighttime or on the weekend right and so the spot program is

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:58.010
something where we will we will sell compute power at a pretty significant

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:10.340
discount like 50% off yeah okay if it's using those off peak times but one of

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.780
the consequences is and we have multiple different versions of this product but

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:23.330
one of them is give it to you much cheaper however if a customer comes in and

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:29.650
asks we may evict yeah your capacity and take it back pretty much the exact same

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.480
feature set and product that GCP's had for five years but we've had it for

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:42.940
much longer than five years and Amazon has it as well yeah right um but that's

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:49.200
one where it's definitely a lower quality product right because we could evict you

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.800
at any point you're choosing to get a discount to your sacrificing like this is

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.400
okay if it's this can get interrupted it's fine I will take that risk to pay

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:07.700
less money right and so the if you know lesser quality could you lower prices or

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:14.420
higher quality but higher prices yes you can you can have ways to leverage

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:21.780
quality into money all right what's the next question can can we slash customers

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:29.170
really compare quality of our products with the competitors products yes yeah

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:38.490
I mean I'm not well absolutely you can and they do customers do customers

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.770
absolutely do the problem I have with the question is can we meaning us

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:49.890
internally so you have to Mike that's what that's all point of the the

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:58.780
competitive analysis however like if it's exactly the same product like you need to

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:04.300
know that you need to it's really hard to differentiate we can we can and we have

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:12.300
and we will and we do yes we've been doing on a point-by-point basis no no

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.580
can't but the best of customers care about right you could do and I know

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.150
Microsoft has done this any company in the world could do this just just

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:26.350
freaking scrape reddit and do sentiment analysis on your on your product versus

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.150
a customer's product and that you can do that internally a software team and

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:35.310
compare quality again how well does help us solve our problem across multiple

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:41.460
products and Microsoft's done that for a long freaking time and anybody can do

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:47.340
it well I would argue for example the magic quadrant like gardeners made its

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.020
whole business yes right so yeah absolutely you can and it's being done

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:57.260
and depending on what you're like he's talking about a cloud enterprise

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.100
product pretty good chance if it is indeed a cloud enterprise product pretty

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:08.340
good chance it is being done yeah right and the customers of that you can just

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.180
they're comparing products all the time everybody's looking for something cheaper

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:23.090
and better I spent a lot of time in in Azure's support strategy in an

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:31.660
ecosphere and I can tell you from from seeing customer cases right that

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:38.220
customers do they absolutely do you can get the feedback from them directly if

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:44.940
you if you have the right systems in place is quality just a cost or does

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:56.140
quality also generate profit it generates profit well it is it a cost I

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:01.020
would argue that quality is as much of a cost as a cost is a building

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:07.530
this is where I go back and forth so when I look at this I look at quality in

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.250
terms of the customer's perception and the ability to solve the problem and I

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:16.620
also look at quality because I think still most of the audience also still

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:24.700
thinks of code correctness right code correctness hey can I can I ship code

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.380
that that solves most of the problems pretty quickly at a cheaper price if I

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:38.010
don't care about bugs yeah but here's the thing not if you want to

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.290
continuously do it if you go back to the feedback loop that you were talking

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:47.040
about how do we speed up the cycle time you can't scale your product off of

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.010
crap right actually and that's exactly I was gonna say poor quality means you're

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.090
doing rework and churn and support costs and engineering drag and people quitting

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:03.520
because the product sucks those are maybe it's an investment more than a

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.010
cost you have to invest in quality because again like I answered a few

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:13.930
questions ago if you have faster cycle time and fewer production issues and

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:20.810
happier customers like or higher and say MPS so let's say does it cost me more to

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:26.720
build a product that has a higher NPS and the answer is I don't how many bones

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.700
are in mannings I don't know it may it may not but if you could call it a

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.540
cost if that investment is good but if you're you make it back a hundred times

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:44.420
well it depends like I think about right I could do a big design up front product

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:54.390
I could do a whole bunch of cost and have it not ever payout right so it's the

00:27:54.390 --> 00:28:01.300
feedback loop that becomes critical and and I'm not certain like if I were to say

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:07.820
okay let's say you and I were to start a new startup and we're gonna make a

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:14.280
whole new Windows OS just the two of us yeah let's do it but we're gonna do it

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:21.320
old-school because Python we miss 1988 mm-hmm we're gonna we're gonna we're

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:26.440
gonna spend six months speckin out the features yeah and it's not gonna ship

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:33.560
for another five years but we're gonna have three betas it's fine now we don't

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:40.480
need the betas that's too expensive got it got to print those CD ROMs right

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:47.440
floppies so we're gonna be heavily focused on bug passes or bug bashes and test

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.240
passes and all of that because in that world you test quality into the product

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.200
you don't know right and and a big chunk of that type of quality is

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:04.470
absolutely a cost in my humble opinion okay but yeah right okay but done right

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:09.990
done the modern testing way it's not I would say quality can be a cost it does

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.750
not have to be a cost you don't want it to be a cost you don't want to be a cost

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:19.150
like one of my favorite favorite piece of advice like when I look at this I

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:25.110
guess like okay what's the cost gonna be to maintain it right I want I want my

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:32.660
team to make sure that some of that monitors like I I I don't want a

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.780
strategy where we're where we are at risk of re-architecting big pieces of it

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:43.570
every three months that's that's a death knell but if we don't know where

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:47.770
we're going that's what we have to figure out first if we don't know what our

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:52.250
product is and what the customer's definition of quality I've actually had

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:57.530
this conversation with my team recently I have a bunch of data scientists who who

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:02.170
who are new they don't understand they're like but Brent when I did my

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:09.830
paper right the metric what was matter in the and from my doctoral thesis like I

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.630
had to get the quality as high as possible when I'm like yeah you're not an

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:20.380
academia anymore I want the I want the product out the door oh great you don't

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:29.470
care about quality no that's wrong I care very much about quality you aren't

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:35.810
qualified to tell me if we have a quality product my customer is and

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:40.770
everything that you and I are talking about is theory until it goes out to my

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:49.820
customer so if we believe this is better than the current system and you're a

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.330
data scientist you should be able to measure that if we believe it's better

00:30:54.330 --> 00:31:00.960
then I want it out the door because I want the feedback loop does that make

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:07.040
sense it does completely so I think we've the last one is do you have examples

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.320
of companies think we gave some I could probably rack my brain and think of a

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:18.120
bunch more but it's the household names it's the the things you you the canonical

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.480
names I don't know if I think pager duty sometimes I get mad because they're

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.800
expensive but and and they but they don't really have much competition

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.060
because everybody who wants to set this up knows it will work you say pager duty

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.820
yeah is that a company yeah your branch worked at Microsoft where they didn't

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:42.020
never use these things everybody else uses a page duty yeah no

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:47.460
means you have a goddamn pager so it's so funny yeah you live too deep in the in

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.060
the in the bubble but things that are canonical if there's a thing and there's

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.540
a tool that everyone uses for it it's probably because of quality and you could

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:04.850
argue well this other open source thing is way better and and I'll go back to the

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:09.330
thing Brent's probably for the price right you have two products one the

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.970
product with a lot of bugs and a hundred thousand users and one product with no

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:21.440
bugs and hundred users which one's higher quality the one with more users yeah

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.080
absolutely and there's a reason for that so if you look at some of the de facto

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.640
standards the ones that haven't been shoved down your throat by by IT like

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.160
Microsoft Teams but things that are considered a standard for what they do

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:42.440
they're almost always high quality not always I would say almost always the

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:53.790
ones that take on a specific scenario and then nail it yeah right that I like

00:32:54.790 --> 00:33:03.530
slack is fantastic a servo survey monkey fantastic right there's there's other

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:10.500
decisions when I think about tools of that nature right like I don't know what

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:16.900
pager duty is it sounds like a DRI yeah you set up yeah it's not who you think

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:25.700
it is okay yeah if there's something on on the open market that whenever you

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.100
like make a tools decision you're like okay is it more effective for me to to

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:35.540
buy a solution to to rent one or build one in-house yeah and that's a whole

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:40.540
other conversation we're not going to talk about but of course is is the I

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.420
didn't think about this until I left Microsoft for a startup and just

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.060
briefly on this before we go on is the decision to should we buy this thing if

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.500
you're a brand new startup and you have 20 people or a hundred people you buy

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.260
almost everything or you rent it or you rent it yeah yeah if there's a turning

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.380
point now Microsoft built almost everything not even everything but almost

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.820
everything you didn't weren't buying a lot of software to use at Microsoft

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:13.220
that's no that hasn't changed our relationship with open source has

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.060
what's interesting is when because there is a tipping point that you've never

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:25.380
gone through where where a company it no longer makes sense because of prices per

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:33.560
seat to buy something and it makes sense to build it and generally my heuristic

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.760
for that is how much does this cost versus how many FTEs would it cost of

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.750
employing FTEs to build and maintain it and you get to a point in a company size

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.870
and it could it's depending on the engineering org and the cultural kinds

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:55.950
things could be anywhere from you know 1500 to 5,000 engineers at some point it

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:59.630
gets cheaper to build more and more and more you never to go build your own

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:04.910
cloud infra but some things team organizations are going to begin to

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.550
build lots of examples won't go into today but it's I don't think you ever

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.910
talked about that but it's interesting because at Microsoft I never we didn't

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:17.750
buy anything everything we built ourselves at Unity we bought everything

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:23.750
and only as I was leaving as they were cutting the number engineers down it

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.190
started making sense to build some of those things we have been buying before

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:32.340
so it would have been great at that company what it's still around and we

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.700
may and I still really like it just it's a lot different from when I was

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:42.460
there it would be fun to be at a company navigating through that transition

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.220
because I have to imagine every company's gone through it like Netflix I bet early

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.660
on they bought all of their stuff and then built a bunch of really cool tools

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:57.800
as it made more sense to build them like any brought up Netflix like I'm I wonder

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:04.860
if I wonder to what degree Netflix is in the cloud versus because they started

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.700
up on their own infra yeah I don't remember they're mostly oh maybe they use

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.420
AWS as backup I can't remember I think they're actually now I can't remember

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:23.940
it's it's and there was an article I read just last September nice I still

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:30.860
have time to read they claimed that a lot of companies are are now developing

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:39.010
cloud exit strategies that that came up at the interview as well I think it to

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:43.890
get pretty big before I think there's a lot of variables in there and choosing to

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:50.050
do your own data going back to do so well so like none of the clouds really

00:36:50.050 --> 00:37:01.580
have the the dream of the cloud is the compute just works okay and as more and

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.600
more features come more and more complexity like we're kind of in this

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:12.120
stasis where and I would say the cloud industry as a whole month not giving

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:23.080
away any Azure secrets here but it's all Azure but yeah the I forgot where I was

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.200
doing all right doesn't matter does it yeah we got off on a tangent quality

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:39.340
good but quality really needs to be what what your customers care about right and

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:46.940
that's it's a strategic investment absolutely and code correctness also good

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:52.260
also a strategic investment I firmly believe in this is something that I've

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:59.680
hit with my manager or with my team and my manager now echoes it right the

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:06.280
amount the amount of hardening I want in the architecture of my systems are the

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.900
ones that can allow me to live the next three months because I want to

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:19.390
continuously harder not fix all the bugs now right like because understanding that

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:25.710
my products is even helping the customer is is more important than fixing

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:36.140
theoretical February 29th Unicode weird issues okay cool yeah all right last

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.740
episode of A B testing for a while I am going on a long walk in the woods as I

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.700
hinted at in case you didn't listen to the last episode for some reason or you

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:48.220
slept through my talking I'm taking off on April 20th to walk from the Mexican

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:53.020
border and hopefully end up mid-september at the Canadian border and

00:38:53.020 --> 00:39:01.540
lots of stops in between you have a you have an image of your trek plane that

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.900
you're willing to share maybe you should post it well it's just the

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.780
Pacific Crest Trail there's a well-known trail that goes the whole way

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:13.590
it's all I can't anything secret but what I'm going to do and I'll share this

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:18.860
in my blog at angry weasel that substat comm what I'm planning on doing

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.540
it's not there yet friend don't type anything in oh it's looking for the

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:28.340
pct you can see it over my left shoulder in a blurred fashion in my back

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:36.390
wall there yes very similarly looking like California or the the Pacific Coastline

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:41.750
right that's kind of where it goes right up the mountains there so yeah I'm I

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:46.940
forget what you asked I'm oh on my blog I'm gonna post I'm probably gonna do

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:53.820
like some daily updates and I'm going to give you all an opportunity to track

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.700
where I'm at via map my GPS will tell you where I am along the way you can see

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.180
if I got stuck someplace for a while probably just resting probably in a hot

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.700
tub somewhere it's fine I'm not gonna walk every day I will take a few days

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:12.280
off along the way and rest my weary old muscles but yeah I'm I'm sharing are

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.560
you actually doing this red line yeah the red line even like this weird yeah

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:23.750
okay nobody knows what you're talking about so the weird thing is if you go to

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:28.590
Wikipedia I can just tell people there's a weird place in Southern California by

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:34.070
LA where that where the trail goes from going south to north to all of a sudden

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:39.290
going from east to west for a while and then it goes mostly north again it does

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.290
be andered to go around you know to kind of you have to not walk in over cliffs

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:50.530
or things so that's where it goes first 700 ish miles are in the air quote desert

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.330
that goes over some mountains to you but if something California hit the Sierra

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.890
another 500 miles or so gets you through the big mountains there then you have

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:05.770
NorCal Oregon and Washington I wish I could zoom in on this map are you gonna

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:10.450
go walking through wine country nappas over here no nap is much farther north

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:17.160
you're thinking of Sonoma oh you're right France from California I know

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.600
California geography better than he does I don't know anything I will not walk

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.610
through wine country that will not yeah if you walk through freezer park let my

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:35.770
uncle I don't think I will okay cool so yeah I'm anyway I'm just gonna walk I'm

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.730
gonna tell I get tired then I'm gonna put my tent up and go to sleep and

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:45.400
then repeat I'm gonna eat too that's probably good maybe dream you know hunt

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:59.090
squirrels you have so tell me what it say you got your weight down to six pounds my

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:04.850
cut my pack now is 13 13 do you have a backup pair of shoes not that I carry

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:13.550
with me no I will swap out shoes every 400 or so miles okay and how how how

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:19.940
you doing that if you're not carrying them they get airlifted to me no dude you

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:25.100
you go through towns like every three to ten days the whole way and I see and I

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.860
will just go to the store and I'll buy a new pair throw the old pair away and put

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.900
the old pair on and keep walking okay sometimes you're not walking straight

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.700
through the town sometimes you're crossing a road where you hitchhike like

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:42.450
ten miles to town okay so every what it what are you expecting to be your

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:50.050
traversal rate 10 30 miles a day but so probably starting off around 15 okay

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:54.850
getting up to 20 20 plus before I get to the Sierra where it'll slow down again

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:59.810
because it's so much elevation by the time I get to NorCal I expect 25 to 30

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:12.480
miles a day okay all right and so at 15 to 30 so you're going through a town

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.430
what every other day then no it depends on the days where their towns are three

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.870
days apart sure like at the beginning there's towns everywhere by the time you

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:27.160
get like to the Sierra you may go 11 days without seeing anybody okay and

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:33.480
you're like planning on showers along the way or you just cut this big gigantic

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:40.680
bottle of perfume and I will do laundry and take showers good call

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.560
but those will happen probably swim in a few lakes as well with some of the dirt

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:52.900
off but but yeah showers and laundry will happen so yeah it's and also I got a

00:43:52.900 --> 00:44:00.390
bite to food in towns I can't carry 140 days of food no no well I figured you

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:04.590
weren't joking around the you know squirrel chili no no squirrel chili

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:11.990
okay let's do vegan squirrels so it's really just a I'm pretty sure squirrels

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:16.300
are a lot of people a lot of people who don't finish one or two things happen

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:24.330
one is they get hurt sure a lot of people have don't know much hiking

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.850
experience first and do this and they try and do too much they just get hurt

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:32.260
or they fall and they get hurt barring getting hurt the other thing people get

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:38.300
off the trail for is to just they get bored because your job is to get up and

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:44.180
walk every day and they just get frickin tired of it I happen to love it and so

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:50.990
that happened to me so long as I can keep from getting hurt I will make it for

00:44:50.990 --> 00:45:02.530
me I like to explore so if I saw it as giving up and walking every day yeah I a

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:08.730
few a few days I'd be looking for you know a large tree spike to ram mice

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:18.240
into me but I like exploring and so if like if I were going through this I'd be

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.360
like okay I'm definitely gonna go see that I want to go see that I want to go

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:30.910
see that that's how I would be doing my goal would be nuts I would be looking

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:38.020
for the things that I want to go check out take pictures of etc and as I do

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:47.520
that also happen to you know cross the PCT well we'll just doing it the other

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.280
way around I would go crazy there are lots of lots of fun things to look at on

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:59.830
the trail that's why I'm doing it okay okay and I will we'll check in when I

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:04.880
get back we'll do I'll jump back we'll do it I don't know we'll plan for a

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:12.240
podcast in October for the the long-awaited episode 220 220 yeah we'll

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.560
see if how long it takes Alan to figure out how to make everything work yeah I

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.840
may forget my name by then did you write down your password to your device yeah

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.280
it keep all my passwords on it they're on a poster behind my desk oh okay that

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.840
makes sense they're all up there that makes it easier it's all the word

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:38.480
password except for I use twos instead of s's yeah threes instead of ease yeah
