00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040
We need to have everybody gradually moving along on this trajectory to not need the testing

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.160
specialist anymore. But you might not ever get there. You might get there. And if you do get

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.120
there, that doesn't mean that testers are out of work because believe me, there are plenty of other

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:30.500
places that still need software testers. Welcome to AVE testing podcast, your modern

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.620
testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.260
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now on with the show.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.420
Hey, good everyone. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. I should unmute.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.820
And we have a guest. We do.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.260
Say hi, Kristen. Hello.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.340
We have Kristen Jackvone. On the podcast this week, we're going to talk about all kinds of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.060
testing stuff, but we should, I should just let you plug yourself. So maybe we can start with this.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.260
So Kristen, you're here for a good reason to talk about something very exciting and important

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.500
you've done recently. But just say, introduce yourself and talk about your thing and we'll

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.580
go from there. Okay. So I am here to talk about the book that I published in December.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.980
And the name of that book is The Complete Software Tester,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.620
concept, skills, and strategies for high quality testing. And it aims to be sort of a one-stop

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.100
shop to help you with all kinds of testing things, manual testing, automated testing,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.900
API testing, testing strategy, performance testing, mobile testing. It's really, that's why it's called

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.420
The Complete Software Tester. So I'm really excited about it. It's the culmination of a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.620
couple of years worth of work. So yeah, I'm here to talk about it some more and answer your question.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.020
And I have some, I have plenty of questions about it. I think Brent does too. I don't

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.900
know sure where to start. So there's a couple places I could start. One is, well, one, I skim

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.580
through the book. You're right. It is complete. I've always been a fan of the testing books that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.100
were more broad and some stay very broad and are not pragmatic. And the ones that are pragmatic

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.580
are about one thing. And the thing that's great about yours, it's really cool, enough information

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.860
to kind of understand, oh, that's what you do there. Is that fair from your side? Because I have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.100
a statement after that. Yeah, absolutely. And that was a lot of my motivation for writing the book in

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.460
the first place. I discovered software testing sort of late in life. I was almost 40 when I discovered

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.540
that software testing was a thing and that I wanted to do it. And I was so excited about it.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.060
And I wanted to learn as much as I could. And I had a lot of trouble finding the information that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.940
I needed. And a lot of times, if you don't know what you don't know, then you have no way to ask

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.980
questions about it. And just a perfect example would be something like working with a development

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.700
team and wanting to make a change to the code. And the developer says to you, well, we'll just

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.260
pull down the repo and make some changes and then do a PR. It's like, what? What does that even mean?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.940
Like, what's a repo? What's a PR? And so the book is really aiming to kind of give you like a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.180
starting point for a whole lot of different things so that then people can go on from the book and

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.100
know what kinds of questions they need to ask to learn further. Which gets to my point, which

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.500
isn't the intent of your book, but it's the way I'm going to use it when I give copies away. So

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.820
you have a section in your book where you talk about a couple of pages about what will we still

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.740
need software testers, which I want to go to in a minute, because I think you're largely right.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.870
But you may have heard the story I told a few times on the podcast when I was coaching

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.030
a team at Unity that did not have dedicated software testers on how to write

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.110
developers how to do testing. The VP would ask me, how is the dev team doing at testing? And I say

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.190
they do all the tests they know how to do. They had unconscious incompetence. They could test the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.790
stuff they could think of, but they just didn't really think of the things you outline in your

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.310
book. And I think this is actually, while not what you intended, I think this is an excellent

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.150
book to get maybe it was you can tell me, this is going to be an excellent book to give

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.110
developers to help them understand all the different ways they can test the thing they're

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.390
building. Yes, absolutely. And I think maybe on my description of it on Amazon, I might even say

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.230
that that that software developers, I'm not sure it's been a while since I wrote it now. But

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.670
yeah, that's something that we've been working on at Paylocity, which is the company where I work,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.270
because we've been working on an initiative to really have the whole team own quality

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.550
and developers can get very nervous about that. What I need to test, what does that even mean?

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.510
And so, yeah, so this would be an excellent tool for that.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.070
So maybe, I'm glad you feel that way too. I think it's a great way because Brent,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.870
actually, I don't know what Brent does, but I worked with a lot of teams that don't have

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.230
dedicated testers, but it doesn't mean they don't do testing. They do a lot of testing.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.310
Why do we still need dedicated testers?

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.540
I think there are a few reasons. One is that teams change. So you might have a team that

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.820
is just working swimmingly. There's no dedicated testers. Everybody knows exactly what to do.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.580
Everybody works cooperatively together. But then somebody new comes onto the team,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.660
and that really changes the whole team dynamic. So you might need to have somebody focused on

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:56.990
testing at that point to help that new person acclimate. Another thing is that the technology

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.870
changes. So let's say, for example, you've got a team and they're doing a whole bunch of stuff

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.390
with Azure, and then they decide that they need to lift and shift their entire platform over to AWS

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.310
instead. Well, that's going to require different testing. And so while the team is figuring out

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.710
how to do that, having a dedicated tester could be something that would help with the transition.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.350
So yeah, I think those are some of the big reasons.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:32.590
So can I ask a clarification on that one? Because what I heard you mention is dedicated tester,

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.900
but in your two scenarios were ephemeral in nature. Was that by design?

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.630
Ephemeral is in. I'm not providing like a concrete example of something.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:53.310
No. So for example, I'm going to distinguish like your AWS example. I'm going to distinguish

00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:03.150
between a dedicated tester versus dedicated testing is needed. And we need people to do that.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.590
And in ephemeral fashion, meaning it's going to be timebox, it's not going to continue.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:16.380
Did you make that distinction on purpose? Is there a role of a place or do you summarize

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.260
the places where you feel a dedicated tester in a more permanent scenario?

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:32.370
Okay. Yeah, I think I guess my feeling is that a lot of teams just aren't mature enough to be able to

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:42.050
handle all of the testing without that person that thinks about how to test things. And I think

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:48.530
that's the skill set that testers really bring is that testers love thinking about what can go

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:54.290
wrong with this. What are all of the really horrible things that could happen? And how can we test

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:00.690
for those? I think that developers can do that. And certainly developers can be trained to do that.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:08.530
But most teams, they're trying to deal with tech debt. They're trying to churn out features and meet

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:17.890
the business requirements that are put upon them. They might not have the time or even the skills

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:25.730
to do that. So I think it's like they're sort of a testing nirvana where everybody understands

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:32.770
exactly what needs to be done and how to do it. But how many of us are really going to get there?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.130
Some of us. Maybe not all of us, at least not right now.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:42.530
Yeah, I think that's a good way to see it. It's not exactly what we've talked about with a test

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:47.570
coach, but kind of somebody there to kind of help people. And I've been in that role before

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:54.130
myself and there is value there. So yes, oh, by the way, and it's my mistake, I actually just kind

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:59.250
of flipped through the forward again of your book where you actually do explicitly say this book

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:05.090
could be for developers, too. So good. See, I didn't remember. You didn't even know I asked a dumb question.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.600
Yeah, no, I so that's one thing I adore. I do think so. Like I

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.260
were not doing live stream. So the podcast won't see this. But one of the questions I wrote down

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:30.300
is, OK, I wanted to explore sort of this idea around the tester mindset. And I think I think

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.700
Chris and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think you'll say, yeah, there is a tester

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:42.940
mindset, but not in the way that is often described when those terms are used. That that in other

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:50.540
words, I don't think you would argue that this tester mindset is exclusive to testers.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:58.060
Right. Yeah. It does can be trained. And as Alan just pointed out, it's in the forward.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.380
And then in your last your last answer to the question, you mentioned that it's going to be

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.660
based on the maturity of the team. And you also mentioned you're a huge proponent. Well,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:18.060
I don't think you said huge, but a proponent of whole team. Yes. And so

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:25.940
a dedicated tester specialist, I think you're going to say you're going to argue, hey, it's going to

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.900
be based on business needs. And sometimes you're going to need it because the business needs it

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:39.620
because they have a gap that needs to be filled. Right. But I think you would. Well, you tell me

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:45.540
instead of me constantly telling you your words, how about I ask you a question about that, Brett?

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:52.510
Yeah, that that that might make for a better interview long term. Where do you see it going?

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:00.240
I think, well, one thing that that has made me so happy over the last couple of years,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.000
working where I do is to see the quality of software testers that we have been hiring.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:15.120
And those those testers have a lot of coding skills and they have a lot of I guess I'll call

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.360
it nontraditional testing skills for the lack of a better word, but like they know about security

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.000
testing. They know about performance testing. And so what I'm seeing is that we're starting

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.430
to develop what I will call a full stack tester. That's a tester who understands accessibility

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:41.630
testing, security testing, load testing. They know how to help shepherd a release through on release

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:47.870
night. They can go in there and make changes to the code when they need to. Like if there's

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.990
like an accessibility item that that needs to be worked on, like, oh, you know, we're missing a

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.630
tag here or something like that, they can go in and they can make those changes. They can

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:04.910
put together entire frameworks. So I'm imagining that that sort of what's going to happen is

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:12.670
like emerging where the testers are getting better and better and better at more technical

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.310
and more development related things, whereas the developers are getting better and better and

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:23.230
better at the testing things. So that's what I would imagine for the future, but I do not have

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:29.470
a crystal ball and things could change radically. Who knows? Go ahead, Alan. No, I want your

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:37.950
reaction, Brent, because you know, I wholly agree with that. Yes. Right. And as a matter of fact,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:45.470
I would say in general, what we did here at Microsoft kind of followed that pattern.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:52.660
Right. You merge it. Then then you still have to sort of get stuff done

00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:03.140
in this new reality. And I think over time, people generalize. Right. So

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:11.380
Kristen's a listener. That's what I've been informed. I don't know how many episodes she's

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.340
listened to, but I assume you're aware of the modern testing principles that we've.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:26.350
OK, I guess based off of this, principle number seven, this is the one that sort of Alan's

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.990
question line of questioning has been on. Where did we get that wrong?

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:38.350
I don't think you did get it wrong. I will definitely say that a few years ago, and I

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.830
can't remember how many years ago it was that I first became acquainted with the modern testing

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:47.230
principles. I was reading through them and I was number one, number two, like, yeah, yeah,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:54.160
this is great. I love this. And I got to seven and I was like, this is oh, my God,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.440
they're talking about getting rid of testers. And it took me a long time. And it took me

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:06.960
listening to your podcast to to really think about it. And I realized that

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:13.020
the wrong thing to do would be to read this and say we don't need testers anymore

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:19.420
because then you're going to wind up with with applications that suck. Like,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:29.100
what we need is we need to have everybody gradually moving along on this trajectory to

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:36.540
not need the testing specialist anymore. But, you know, you might not ever get there.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.860
You might get there. And if you do get there, that doesn't mean that testers are out of work,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:46.620
because believe me, there are plenty of other places that still need software testers. I know

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.260
because every time I interact with an application, you know, I'm filling out a form to order

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.980
something or whatever, and I discover the pop up doesn't work right or or I can't get

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.500
to the button I need to click like that. We're going to need testers for a long, long time.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.660
You've seen the light on this and you get it exactly right. And Brent knew this. He asked

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:12.060
a very leading question because everything you talked about before described that the principle

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.260
seven says it may reduce or eliminate the need for dedicated testing specialists because it may.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:22.700
And a lot of times it does. But what we really want to do there is get rid of

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.500
a dedicated specialist as a bottleneck and at the point where you're there to

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:36.380
advise and look into some of the the areas that even a good developer tester may not get to

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:42.590
being there for those things. There's there's plenty to do there. And I'm a big fan of the

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.860
of that sort of role. And I just flipped it a little bit farther. Like we have,

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:54.990
I think I mentioned on the podcast, I have a small team of people who function as quality coaches,

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.750
most like much like you said, being dedicated on one team, they bounce around a little bit.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:04.110
Sometimes they consult for the really little mini consultant team. Sometimes they consult for

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.990
an hour, half a day, a day. One person has been embedded on a team for three months to help them

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:15.070
bootstrap some automation, just whatever they need to help them build that testing knowledge.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.110
Maybe instead of consulting, I can send them copies of your book.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:26.030
But yeah, I think everything you've talked about says that you have seen past the words on a page

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.990
on the page, which can be scary around principle number seven and actually have figured out what

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.750
that means in practice. It's not scary. And it's not a definitive like we're getting rid of testers

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:41.310
is you just actually make it so good at making software quality software from the beginning

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.750
that dedicating someone to testing all the time would be a waste.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:51.070
I absolutely believe that a tester specialist today, a traditional tester specialist,

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:56.910
if they invest in what we are, if they invest in understanding and what we're talking about

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:04.590
in the modern testing and festivals, they will not only be excited about the removal of

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:10.270
or the potential removal of a testing specialist. What I've observed in the industry,

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:17.470
every time we go through the cycle and we improve, that individual becomes a lot more valuable.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:24.590
And I've said, actually, Kristen, you just brought up it. You believe that there's an eventual

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.670
merging of these things. Have you actually observed that yet in practice?

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:34.270
Well, I have a fun story to tell you about one of the teams at my company, and I'm going to give

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:39.710
the shout out to the core platforms team just in case they're listening today. So this was a team

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:46.750
of developers. They do as their name suggests, they do a lot of sort of back end stuff. They

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:56.510
they deal with caching and with API governance and with messaging, that kind of thing. And so they

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:03.870
had formed this team. They really wanted a software tester. And it just was not in the cards.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:09.550
Budget wise, they were told, no, you can't have a tester. So my role at the company is really to

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:15.310
help all of the teams adopt quality practices. And so I met with them and they said, well,

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.550
what are we going to do? Well, one of the other things that they wanted to work on was

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:24.590
eliminating silos because they've got a lot of really smart people on their team. Each one of

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:30.030
them was an expert in one of these different areas. And they really wanted to make sure that

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:34.910
it wasn't just one person, they were they were all experts so that someone could go on

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:40.430
vacation and not get called up in Hawaii. Hey, our caching system isn't working correctly. Can

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:47.070
you help us? So I suggested that they form testing buddies so that each one of them as the feature

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.710
expert and the one that was doing most of the dev work would be paired with one of the other

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:57.630
people. And that person would do the testing. And in the process of doing the testing,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:02.750
not only would they learn about being a better tester, but they would also learn about the

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.950
other product that they were testing. And so they tried that out and that worked really well for

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.750
them. And then the other thing, the other idea that they came up with on their own was they

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:18.430
decided that they needed to have a test application, one that was different from what's running in

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:23.870
production, that they could try out all kinds of things on sort of like a sandbox to say,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:30.110
let's run all of our tests against this and see what happens when we when we make those changes.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.710
And so they've been working on that. And they're really excited about that. And they've come up

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:39.790
with some other testing frameworks to for observational purposes to see things like,

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:45.550
you know, are they getting any message loss when the messages are going out? So I'm really excited

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.590
and happy for them about the innovation that they've had together. And so now they're proving

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.870
they don't need a tester. They can solve these problems themselves. Yeah, that's, that's a

00:19:55.870 --> 00:20:02.990
fantastic story. It's essentially one of the things that what is it? Necessity is the mother

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:09.230
of invention, right? If you if you set the stage in a way, like you told the story like, no, you're

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:16.030
not getting a tester. And no, you are going to continue to have the expectation of high quality

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:22.670
outputs, right? Well, then you figure out how to solve it. The the other thing I was trying to

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:29.790
get to is we talked about you you predicted that you predicted that over time you see sort of

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:35.150
tests becoming more devish and then dev becoming more test ish. And I'm wondering,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:42.860
have you have you experienced any sort of ecosystem of that occurring? I have I'm just

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.620
curious. I have a question on that. I'm curious if you have experienced that yet. Well, one one

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:55.180
thing that I've seen, we had a push this year to get involved in accessibility testing. That's

00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.940
something that's very important. The company where I work, we we do payroll software and we and, you

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.100
know, time cards and things like that we want to make sure that all of our users are going to be

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:12.940
able to use the application. And so teams started doing some testing, and we had a group of three

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:19.020
testers who got very interested in accessibility testing. And as they were learning about it,

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.940
they discovered just how easy it is to solve some of those accessibility problems, like to put in

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:33.020
like an alt image tag or to put in other descriptions or to change the level of headers.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.020
Apparently, that's important for screen readers. So as they were learning these things,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:42.140
they also realized these are simple changes that we know how to make. So they were going in

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:48.060
to their team software and they were making all of the changes and doing the pull request and getting

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.660
the approval and getting those changes pushed through. So I think that that's sort of the

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.820
tip of the iceberg. I think we're going to continue to see more things like that as we go forward.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.580
Nice. And I think the second part of your question was the devs becoming more like testers.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:11.900
We actually had one dev we switched over recently to using Cyprus for for UI automation. And now

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:20.940
we're moving into API automation with Cyprus as well. And we had one developer who was so excited

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.620
about Cyprus that he switched over to become a software test engineer instead. So I think,

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.020
you know, we'll see some of that as well. Well, that I'll just say this and I can have Jason

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.980
Huggins yell at me later. That doesn't happen with Selenium.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:46.610
I don't know that I don't know that we'll inspire Huggins to come and try to yell at us again.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:54.690
So that was fun. We I was just thinking about the same thing. No. So one of the things that I've

00:22:54.690 --> 00:23:04.640
observed, Chris, and is that when you push what I've observed in my prior histories is that testers

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:13.810
becoming dev, even though they don't have sort of the history on like the the O of one algorithms and

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:21.650
such. I find I have found and it may be subjective bias. That's what I was testing. I have found that

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:28.130
they end up being superior developers. Oh, yeah, I was just going to say I've seen I've seen that

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:35.890
before too. I've seen testers switch over to be developers and contribute greatly to projects.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.810
The other thing that I've seen that I really like is testers who switch over to be managers.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:48.850
And those managers really understand what it means to have the whole team on quality.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:56.130
So here's here's another example from from my workplace. Someone I worked with, hello,

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:06.370
Monica, was a tester and she became a manager of a team and she instituted sort of a process

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:12.370
right before the team releases. They all do exploratory testing together. All of them,

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:17.730
developers and testers are all doing that exploratory testing. And so what happened

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.610
with that was the testers were teaching the developers here are the things that you need

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.410
to look for when you're testing. And then the developers were also learning more about the

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.690
product too, because sometimes the developers can kind of get involved, like with one little section

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.450
of code and they're not really looking at the whole picture. So they were really seeing the

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:42.290
big picture. And so all of them working together found great bugs before they released. And so,

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:51.410
yeah, I think that testers make great managers. I definitely think that putting the tester in

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:57.810
a manager role, if you're going to go with a unified engineering model, they're going to

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:03.170
think about the whole system in the end. Yeah, testers, people who have spent time in testings

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:09.010
tend to be more systems thinkers, not universally true, but that's my experience in general.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.930
One thing we've talked about a lot here, not directly, but I'm going to call it out is,

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:18.930
you know, you've been in testing since 2009. So I think long enough where maybe you cut the tail

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:24.370
end of the testers versus developers, but there's none of that when you're talking about it. That's,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.130
I like to think in most companies, although for what I read on Twitter, it's not true, but

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:33.250
I think at least a lot of companies, maybe most companies are past that and it's a collaboration.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.970
I think that's helps, but I wanted to talk about a tweet that I did this week, nothing to do with

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:43.650
your book, but I want you to tell a story from your book based on this. So I ran across yet

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.490
another, I won't even say where I got it, because I'll probably piss somebody off, but yet

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:56.690
another complaint about manual versus automated testing and labels, labels, labels. So I tweeted,

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.930
the coolest thing that happens when developers own all of their own testing is that all the

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:05.970
arguments around manual versus automated versus exploratory versus whatever all go away.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:12.130
Because it's all just testing. And before I have you tell hope, remember the story you told from

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:17.200
this chapter in your book. One of the thing again, is isn't we're having, we're having

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.480
Kristen on the podcast. She can talk about the book. We're not like, we don't, we're not,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.560
we're going to, we're going to talk up your book because it's good. But the, one of the things I

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.960
like it and brain, you would like it too, because you have the attention span of, of this

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.600
piece of cloth right here and the book, you want to sit down and read a chapter of the book. You

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:41.200
can be done like in 30 seconds, a minute or two, depending on the chapter. It's all little bite

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:50.400
size chunks. So chapter like 564, I'm making this up, is on the whole manual versus automated debate.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.960
And I liked the way you just call bullshit on it. So do you remember the story from there?

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.560
Do you want to share that? Yeah, I'm not sure if it's a story, but, well, it's not really a

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.960
story, but the anecdotes you shared, like, yeah, the three software testers, Marsha,

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:12.430
yeah, yeah. And then yeah. All right. So I actually, I have the book open here so that I can

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:20.190
remember all the details. Marsha is the software developer and test. So she's very proud of her

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.910
automation skills. And she sees, you know, the feature that that's coming down the pike. And

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.630
she says, Oh, I know just what to do with this. And so she writes a whole bunch of automation

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:36.590
and makes sure that, you know, everything's running and, you know, the feature is released and all of

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:41.630
her tests are running and passing and isn't it awesome, but she didn't pay a whole lot of

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:48.510
attention to the acceptance criteria. So as a result, she missed one really important use case.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.390
And now there are end users who are seeing errors when they use the application because

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:59.470
she completely missed that. And so then we've got Cindy, who's the manual tester.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:05.230
Cindy read all of the requirements very, very carefully. And she came up with a very elaborate

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:13.630
test plan where she's manually testing everything, but because she's doing everything manually,

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:19.230
she can't keep up with the frequent software releases that the team is doing. So, you know,

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:24.670
the team is saying, okay, well, I just, I pushed some code here. Can you check it out? And it's

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:30.030
like a day and a half before she's done with all of the testing and the developers want feedback

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.710
right away. They want to know, did I break something? I don't want to know a day and a

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.670
half from now. I want to know now. So then we've got Jan, Jan's there in the middle.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:46.670
And she does both. Jan is reading the requirements, the acceptance criteria. She is interacting with

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:53.150
the application to really understand how it works as a system. And then she's creating automated

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:59.630
testing that is going to be sensible and is going to reflect all of the acceptance criteria and all

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:07.070
the use cases that she's discovered. And so as a result, that means that the developers can

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:12.270
make the changes and push the code and know right away if they've broken anything.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:12.750
Yeah.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.670
So which one should you be? Should you be a manual tester or an automated tester?

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.270
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:27.150
You should be Jan. Another thing I say in the chapter two is that like, I mean,

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:33.470
what does automated mean really? Like if somebody writes a script, like if I, if I need a whole

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:40.670
bunch of like users in my system to test with and I write a script to like put them all in the system

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:47.230
really fast, does that make me an automated tester now? I mean, I made a tool or I did a process

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:56.270
and then like if I'm creating test automation and I push a button to run the test automation and I

00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.910
now a manual tester, like these distinctions are not important. What really matters.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:01.870
Right. That's exactly it.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:07.470
The what's getting tested is what should be getting tested.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:13.790
On one hand, I get the argument like we stopped calling it manual testing and they're absolutely

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.830
right. Yeah.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:22.190
The problem with the automated and manual discussion, in my humble opinion, is the industry

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:28.910
is moving in a place where again, a lot of this stuff is shifting to development.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:36.990
I grew up in my career. I've had multiple people like I am a manual tester and I love this job

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:43.540
and I am never changing. Really? What if the industry changes to put you in a position? How

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:51.860
about now? You get right. And so what I see is a lot of these discussions are really my sense of it.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:57.780
I'm a data scientist now. I have not done a scientific study on this, but my sense of it is

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:05.460
no, it's more of a justification or a rationalization of this is the value we had. But honestly,

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.860
it's no different than in the traditional way, the justification we've always had.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:16.180
Like, like I remember a conversation I had with James, James Whitaker, and we're talking about

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:21.140
what's the ROI of tests. He and I had this over lunch and he's like,

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.460
oh, well, if you want to know what the ROI of test is, just get ready your testers and then

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:32.960
you'll see. Well, you know what? 20 years ago, I would have been clear today. A lot of companies,

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.020
you know what? I think his statement probably still kind of describes it because you got,

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:46.220
in today's world, you got rid of all your testers and nothing changed. That might indicate that no,

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:51.980
no, no, that's that wasn't things have changed. Right. In terms of in terms of the labels,

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.140
I actually think there should be no such thing as automated or manual tester,

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.540
automated and manual testing.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:07.470
Even that's hard. So let me take that and build on that and actually talk about a twist on this,

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:11.150
this last story for the book. Like if I push a button in my manual, if I write a script to

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:17.230
generate stuff or am I an automation engineer, there are, and this is a rant that I've made

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:23.630
before and I'll make it again. There are hundreds, I would say thousands, tens of thousands. I don't

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:29.390
know how many test automation engineers and they are happy with their job of writing

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:36.930
automated Selenium tests all day long. The data show from Nicole Forest was working at Accelerate

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:42.450
that developers owning their own automated tests produce higher quality software. Does that mean

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:47.730
testers write a work? No, because this thing you described like writing a script to generate,

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:52.290
like, oh, I want to generate a bunch of names to test with. I want to generate

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:59.330
a bunch of input strings to put here, whatever. That is a more, for me, that is a more valuable

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:04.530
use of any sort of coding knowledge than writing a gazillion. Is that a number of rent?

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:12.450
They're writing a gazillion Selenium tests. It's what Merit talks about, like exploratory

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:17.170
automated testing. We're going to use the tools to help us get to a state where maybe we can

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:22.370
learn something interesting about the software. That is the kind of thing I want people who are

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.450
doing dedicated software testing to be. Ideally, developers do it too, but that's where the magic

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:32.850
happens. You people, and again, I'm not talking to you because nobody, nobody who writes Selenium

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:38.450
tests all day and loves it is listening to this podcast because they've already turned us off and

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.170
deleted us from the internet years ago, but there's something there.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:50.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That reminds me, oh, I just totally spaced on what it was that I wanted to say.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.570
Oh, hey, Brett, she's one of us. We do this all the time.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:04.930
It's related to, oh, I know what it was. Okay. So at my company, we hire what I consider to be full

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:12.930
stack software testers. So those software testers need to know how to find bugs. And they also

00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:21.970
need to know how to write automation that could help guard against regressions. So we actually have

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:28.610
a two-step process that it took us a little while to refine this, but the very first thing we do

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:36.380
when we have a software tester come in and be interested in interviewing with us, we give them

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:43.340
an application. It's a buggy application. It's got UI bugs. It's got API bugs. And we just say to them,

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:50.140
find all the bugs you can in this application and just write up a bug report in just whatever

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:55.260
style you would want to do to communicate to us what the bugs are. And then we have a scoring

00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:02.700
rubric and we measure, did they find one point bugs? Did they find three point bugs? And it

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:11.420
never ceases to amaze me the inability of these people that can write Selenium tests,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:17.580
but they can't find the bugs. There was one person who liked it.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.420
Because they don't know anything about testing.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:26.460
Yes, yes, exactly. 13 years of testing experience. We had a candidate who could only find three bugs

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:31.740
in the application. It's just, it's amazing. But yeah, I mean, that's really the most important

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:39.500
thing is that mindset to be able to say, what can go wrong here? What could I try here?

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:47.060
So yeah, yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, same rant repeated. But it reminds me a little bit and

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:53.070
Microsoft, I was of course at Microsoft for a long time. For many years there, I was called

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.310
was called an as app interviewer as appropriate, which I was at the end of the loop. I was the

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.390
person said, are they a good Microsoft fit? Can they do the job? And sometimes it was just

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:04.670
selling them if it was somebody who'd done really well on the on the interview loop. And sometimes

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:09.470
it was sometimes it was breaking the tie, kind of figuring out and those were fun too. And sometimes

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:14.750
actually, if they wouldn't even come to me if they were if they were no hires down the road.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:18.590
But one thing that kind of blew me away, it's not similar to testing. These weren't all testing

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:24.830
roles. But in Microsoft, at least at the time, it's probably still true. Most of their hiring

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:29.550
has been right out of college, do a lot of hiring adventure level and then grow them through

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:34.060
the system. One thing that was interesting, like here, like, and I want to the topic I want

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:39.580
to get to around this is I am not a computer science major, neither is Christian. In fact,

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.660
we have a very similar major, but we'll get to that in a moment is I would be the one

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:52.300
interviewing these MIT folks and and Stanford or and sometimes not always app or stage these very

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:58.460
well educated people who were geniuses at the algorithmic computer science level,

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:04.620
but did not have the ability to think their way outside of a bag. High intelligence, low wisdom

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:12.900
for you, D&D players. And it was I see a parallel there. Like I would say even someone without

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:18.180
testing experience who kind of could see the forest for the trees would be able to find,

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.420
you know, they could fake their way through that part. But the fact that we have people

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.940
in testing positions doing testing all day, but they're not really doing testing,

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:34.260
does not surprise me. They would fail miserably there. Yeah, yeah. Well, and and that's that's

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.700
another interesting thing about the testing profession is that software testing is not

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:46.820
taught in college. I deal with a lot of new college grads because we do a lot of recruiting and we

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:52.660
recruit them as soft as software engineers. And I get to spend a whole day with them and teach them

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:59.060
about software testing. And one of the things I do is I ask them, what did you learn about

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:04.180
software testing? What kinds of software testing did you do? And generally, the answer is we learned

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:10.100
how to write unit tests. And that's it. They didn't learn how to think about anything else. And I

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.860
start my day with them by just showing them a little picture. It's just a field, an empty field

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:22.900
and a button. And I say, how would you test this? And, you know, sometimes it's fun to watch them,

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:28.340
because sometimes they'll go to write like SQL injection, you know, like right away. But but

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:33.220
sometimes they'll they'll start to think about, oh, well, you know, well, what if we had too many

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.860
characters in the field? And what if we didn't have enough characters in the field? And I say,

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.620
okay, well, what what if it's a phone number? And then they start thinking about all the

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.540
different things that they could test with the phone number. And hopefully they realize

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:50.820
that phone numbers are different lengths in different countries. Yes, absolutely. Yes. And

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.860
they usually do come up with that. So that's good. But but yeah, I mean, and that's another

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:03.060
reason why I wrote the book is because nobody's teaching software testing in college. Right. And

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:09.630
and I actually don't maybe there should there shouldn't be I do not believe there should be a

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:15.470
software testing degree, there should be a software testing course that, you know, computer

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:20.030
science is a lot about it may not cover that. But if there's a software engineering degree at

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:25.230
a college, definitely should have testing you and I and Brent, excuse us, we alienate you,

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:30.030
maybe, maybe, Brent, I don't know how many people you know, who studied music in college

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:35.070
and found their way into tech, but there's of the three people on this podcast that is true

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:40.190
for two of them. What was your path? So tell me how you got from music into tech.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:48.910
Well, it's it's an interesting story. So I'm old enough that when I was in high school, it didn't

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:54.030
like computer science didn't really even occur to me as being a thing I would be interested in

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:57.950
doing like I took one computer course, the only computer course that the high school offered.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:04.430
But I didn't, you know, this was before there was a thing called the internet where everybody

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:09.310
could communicate and their pretty pictures and and all that. So I never thought that that

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:16.350
computer science would be a thing for me. So I became a music teacher mostly because I couldn't

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:22.190
come up with something else to do. I mean, I liked music and I liked children. So that seemed like

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:28.110
the way to go. So I like music, but I didn't like children. Actually, so I also taught school.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.590
Actually, I liked children. I taught middle school, but I didn't like the other teachers.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:40.990
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so I was a music teacher for a while. I left the I was an elementary school music

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:46.270
teacher. I left that profession when I had my son. And then I taught piano lessons at home for a while.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:53.230
And then I became a church organist and choir director. Then around the same time that I

00:40:53.230 --> 00:41:00.030
was starting to lose interest in that area. I also got divorced and I needed another source of

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:05.950
income. And I had no idea what I was going to do. And I thought, well, what am I good at? Well,

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:11.550
I'm organized. So maybe I could be a professional organizer. So I started a professional organizing

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:19.470
business. I did that for about a year, discovered I didn't like it at all. But that job led me to

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:26.030
being a support person in a tech startup. It was a tech startup that worked with mobile phones,

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.430
they needed somebody to keep track of all the mobile phones, make sure all the software was on it.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:35.150
And so while I was doing that, I thought, this software stuff looks kind of fun, you know,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:40.750
maybe I'd like to be a software developer. So I started taking courses at night to do that.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:49.550
And then very early on into that, the job dried up. And I found myself needing another job. And I

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:54.270
thought, I don't have enough development skills yet to even get an internship as a developer. So

00:41:54.350 --> 00:42:00.590
what else could I do? And so I started looking for like, tech writing. And then I discovered there

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:05.790
was a position open for an intern as a quality assurance engineer. And I thought, Oh, I think I

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:11.950
can do that. I did a little bit of testing in my previous role. So I'll do that. So I went to the

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:20.030
job. It was software that it was voice recognition software on Blackberry phones. This is before

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:27.790
Siri and all of that. And so I showed up on my first day and my supervisor gives me a test plan

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.310
to work through. And so I start working through the test plan. And I noticed something odd that

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:36.430
happens. And I oh, that's interesting. I want let me see if I can do that again. Yeah, that doesn't

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:41.390
look right. Well, what happens if I click this button instead, and I'm clicking the long and then

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:46.270
I said to myself, Oh, I should really stop playing with this phone and get back to work. And then

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:53.310
suddenly I realized this was my job. Like I was supposed to be playing with the phone. I was

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:58.990
supposed to be figuring out what was going on. And it was like the heavens opened. And I was like,

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:04.750
this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Very cool. I also started off, I want to go

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:11.070
my whole story, but my first job in tech was support for in my case, I got out of grad school,

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.950
where I got a master's in composition, where I learned how to use computers pretty well,

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.910
didn't know anything about programming, but I got a job at a company doing

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:22.110
tech support for a company that made music software. I knew I knew the MIDI, I knew how

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:28.830
computers connected to musical devices really well. And then the rest I just kind of figured out.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:36.350
Was it Finale? No, no. I own Finale. Finale is based in the Midwest, I believe. So I've

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:40.910
had a copy in the year, but it was a company called MIDI soft. Oh, okay. So this would have

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:46.350
been a little ahead of your time, because this was, they were mainly an OEM supplier, meaning when

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:50.670
you, in those days, you bought a sound card for your computer because computers didn't come with

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:56.830
those. And when you bought a sound card, it would come with some free software. And that's what we

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:04.830
made. Cool. Yeah, I know a lot of, a lot of great software testers who were French literature

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:10.750
majors in college or history majors or psych majors. Well, one thing to call out here is,

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:16.110
this is off topic, but on topic for this conversation for a long time. I was on,

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.110
they took a break for a while, but I was on the alumni board for my university school of arts and

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:27.490
humanities. Cause we're talking about the value of this liberal arts education. And people think

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:33.820
liberal arts, you'll never get a job. And I say college is not a vocational school. And what I

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:40.700
learned there, I learned so many things that apply directly to what I do every single day,

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:46.700
but I didn't learn a skill. I learned why I learned life skills. I learned aspects of leadership. I

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.460
learned how to problem solve, you know, this from learning how to play a piece of music. What do

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:54.860
you do? You break it down into little pieces. You take those little pieces and you isolate

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:59.020
them to figure out why they're so damn hard. And then you, you work on them, you kind of

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.740
put it all back together and then you're done. And that's similar to how we do problem solving

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:10.700
in tech. It's just different tools in front of us. Now you go to YouTube, you look at the video

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:18.370
and you just copy what they're doing with their hands. Yeah. That's pretty much it, Brent. Yeah.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:24.190
That's there you go. Music, future music majors. I have saved you four years,

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:31.070
but the thing is, and I'll go into this, we can get to closing, but there's so much more to it.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:38.430
Like playing the right notes is such an infinitesimal small part of being a musician.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:44.530
A lot of times we work really hard to make things look easy, but it sounds like you maybe

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:50.930
were a piano major. I was a voice. Well, I was a music major with a concentration in voice.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:55.250
I did play the piano also. So you know this from choir. It's like, it's like in playing in

00:45:55.250 --> 00:46:01.410
ensembles to like listening. I think there's a parallel between listening and playing for

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:07.890
blend and pitch. That is very similar to how we communicate with people at work.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:15.570
Yeah. And you know, I played a lot of different woodwind instruments when I was playing saxophone

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:22.300
in a jazz band. There are even subtle gestures you can make to get people to do something,

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:26.380
to get your section to do something different together. They just kind of pick up on those

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:32.260
things. And that's kind of where I equate that to little bits of coaching, like a little,

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:37.700
but even a little head nod in a meeting will make people feel like you're engaged.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.940
It helps with engagement. So anyway, all kinds of little parallels I pick up on.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.860
Brent, it's just so much more than pressing the right notes.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:51.860
Well, and another thing that really benefited me from being an elementary school music teacher

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:59.700
is that I learned how to explain things to very small children. And because of that, I feel that

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:07.220
I'm adept at breaking things down into their simplest parts to then explain to other people,

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.740
including adults, including people who want to learn about testing.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:15.220
You know what? I'm glad you brought that up because people have mentioned that to me before

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:22.660
that something that I do, I didn't even realize it, is I take people that have been in computers

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:29.740
their whole life often have a difficult time explaining technically what something is.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.300
Often, I got some really nice feedback from one of our finance VPs that said,

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:40.940
Alan, it's just a really good job because I track a lot of our cost spending.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.980
And say, Alan, it's just a really good job explaining these things in a way that we understand.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.900
And it isn't that I'm trying to explain it to them in a way they understand.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.780
I'm trying to explain it to them in a way I understand.

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:58.780
But yeah, I think that there is something there, learning or just having, you know,

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.820
from either teaching private lessons or studying privately, when you have a good instructor,

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.500
they have multiple ways to explain the same thing. They have different things they can try,

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.940
knowing that eventually one of them will resonate and you'll nail it.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.940
So I think those skills are all great too.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:18.540
Well, and they say that if you want to really understand something,

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:23.420
you ought to teach it to somebody else. And so that is one of the things that I'm doing with

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:28.700
this book also. I mean, it's funny, a lot of the chapters of my book are based on blog posts

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:34.220
that I've had over the years. And I actually go back and I look at my blog posts when I've

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:40.060
forgotten how to do something. So I'm like, thanks past me. Thanks for reminding me

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.940
what I'm supposed to do when I run into this problem.

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:48.940
I think that's the purpose of blog posts is like, okay, now I can free all that memory from my brain

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:55.740
and bring in new things. But it's interesting. Sorry, I'm going to go back to a thing with,

00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:05.520
so I've known Alan forever, it seems. So we've talked on the podcast. He and I are in terms of

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:13.120
Myers Briggs, which is essentially an advanced horoscope, but he and I are essentially the same

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:20.400
type, but he has a bunch of talents that I don't have. It's not, I don't think it's associated.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:27.120
Like he is an introvert. I am an introvert, but Alan in particular, he can generate energy in

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:36.800
a crowd of a community of like-minded folks. He's always been able to really do that. And one of

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:43.680
the things I'm now actually hypothesizing is I wonder, Alan, if your music degree is where that

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:52.480
came from, the ability to work with and collaborate with others, because in terms of like an orchestral

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:58.560
environment, I think both of you would likely argue that that's pretty critical.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.480
Yeah, I do see the parallels there. What about you, Christian?

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:09.120
Definitely. And I just want to mention, I think it was a most recent podcast you were talking

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.080
about the Myers Briggs and saying that you were both INTPs. I am an INTJ.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:17.120
Oh, a judger. I see what's going on now.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:25.760
But yeah, I mean, I think sometimes people are surprised that I'm an introvert because they,

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:31.280
you know, I'm happy bubbly and hey everybody, let's do this. But I think a lot of that comes

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.960
from my music background. I mean, I did a little bit of musical theater and I took conducting

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:42.400
courses and I was able to lead and conduct a choir. So I think that those leadership things

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.970
probably come out of that. Yeah. I don't know about where you went to school, but one of the things,

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:54.370
and again, I can do it all, but it exhausts me. I'm tired at the end. But one of the things I

00:50:54.370 --> 00:51:01.410
hated the most out of school was recital hour. Like sit there. Yeah. Okay. We call it convocation,

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:07.170
but an hour a week, every week of performances of students playing in front of the entire

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:12.370
music department, I would hate it when my teacher would say, you should sign up, play

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:21.360
that at convocation next week. I go, no, I don't want to. Yeah. I hated that too. And even when I

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.400
was a church organist, playing the organ is extremely difficult. It's more difficult than

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:32.480
playing the piano because you have to play a keyboard with your feet as well. And it was,

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:39.920
every single week I was just so terrified. So performance was never something that I enjoyed.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:45.360
So I'm happy to speak publicly. I can do that. That doesn't bother me at all. But like having

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:51.280
actually played notes or sing while everybody is listening, I would really prefer not to do that.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:58.880
It's interesting for me in terms of that. So I will often remind people introvert has

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.880
really does not like, um, means your energy from, right?

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:14.160
Shine away from people or public speaking ability is a common symptom for lack of a better. I don't

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:20.080
even want to call it symptom, but it's often associated with introversion, but it is not a

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:26.160
requirement. It's not a causal thing. Because I'm in it for, it doesn't mean I have, I don't have

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.680
the ability to speak to people, but I will tell you one thing for me, like I am no longer

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:37.200
uncomfortable talking in front of a crowd. I'll happily go in front of a crowd. No problem

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:44.240
whatsoever, except for one condition where I am the center of attention. Now it's not,

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.560
it's not a hypocrisy. Like when I'm, when I'm going and talking in front of a crowd,

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.240
I usually view it as whatever I'm presenting. That topic is the center of attention. And I

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.880
am just the conduit. But if I'm the center of attention, like put me in front of 200 people

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:04.960
to celebrate a birthday. Oh my God. I have a thousand things I need to do that day. That's

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:12.320
way higher priority, including like washing my dishes. I will run and hide for that environment.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.400
So it's, so we got to close, but there is one thing I did want to share

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:25.360
so I didn't come from a music background. I came loser. Yeah. I just have three tech degrees. I'm

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:34.720
sorry, but I will just pass on. I have learned a way to hire testers in the face of schools.

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:40.320
Don't now it may not be a scalable way, but what I suggest in the past or what,

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.560
what I suggest, if you're going to go to school and you're, you're looking specifically for

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:54.160
testers, go talk to the department heads, go talk to the lab managers and find the students in,

00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:02.860
in the computer science lab that everyone goes to, to debug the ones that have a reputation

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:09.760
for being excellent at debugging. Those are testers. Man. I love debugging. Me too.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:17.310
Fricking love debugging. This to me, it's a puzzle. This is what went wrong. Yeah.

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:24.190
So when I was still was a tester, every time I got to send an email, Hey, I was looking at your code

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:33.340
to a developer. You have an off by one bug. Oh yeah. Oh, those just, I just, I adored those

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:40.220
because I'm like, really, dude, really? You got an off by one bug. Like really? Anyway. Yeah.

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:49.470
Those are fun. Let's close here. Uh, Kristen Jack, Voni. Yes. Super happy and excited to be on the

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:55.870
podcast. Thank you for all that your book, the complete software tester available on Amazon or

00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:01.980
I guess other places where you can get books. It's awesome. I'm a big, I'm a fan of it. I like,

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:07.820
again, me, the big takeaways are I want to give it to developers and there's lots of little short.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:12.460
It's just short snippets, but they're organized really well. It's, it's, you know,

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:15.980
I didn't read them all. I looked at, I kind of went through, looked at the headlines and

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:20.700
did my little homework here and, and, uh, I learned a lot. It's like, yes, this is

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:26.780
one of the most pragmatic, if not the most pragmatic testing book or comprehensive,

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:31.820
comprehensive pragmatism. I don't know something like that. Anyway, super excited.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.820
All right. Well, it worked. It, it, that resonated with me. Um,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:42.060
thanks for being on the podcast. Really appreciate it. Yes. Thank you, Kristen. Yeah.

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:48.220
Thanks for having me. All right. Thanks everybody for listening. We'll see you later. Bye.
