00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.260
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.380
and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.700
agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey Brent how's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.820
it going it's going awesome Alan how about you I'm doing great did you have a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.780
good fourth doing great I didn't do anything at all not a little bit not even

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.220
a little bit I did nothing I don't think I think I was asleep by like 10 p.m. I'm

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.340
pretty boring so what are you doing there all I see is the top of your head and a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.660
bunch of moving around I'm moving around and got a top of my head I did breast a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.020
record button we skipped the week of podcasts and I forgot how to do a

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.980
podcast it's a little bit difficult I could remember what to plug in where and

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.420
I forgot to put headphones on and then just I'll tell a quick little story it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.980
like riding a bike right it is a little bit so I always do the podcast

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.430
recording from my Mac which we are today the other day I don't know whether

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.150
it was a zoom update or a Linux update because I took two both at once and then

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.710
ever since then sort of randomly zoom crashes very horribly on my Linux

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.350
machine so horribly that once it crashes my whole desktop is locked like

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.670
everything is frozen and in the no Michelle because I'm on Ubuntu and then

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.710
maybe two or three minutes later it just then it finally crashes completely takes

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.150
back to the login screen I have to log in and start over so I thought well I

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.030
don't have time to debug this and figure out what the hell happened so I

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.860
will just begin using my Mac it's probably a faster machine and does

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.990
things better than my that's what I'm doing and but then there was a reason

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.030
for this story oh I just kind of I'm used to turning the other way and I moved

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.630
instead of using the Mac camera I switched my other camera to use the Mac

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.820
anyway long story nobody cares because nobody can see anything so how's work yeah

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.340
anything new and exciting no I know yeah Brent is so thrilled with life right

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:34.240
now I don't know man let's do a podcast yeah TGI yes should we start recording

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.160
another day of the week so you have some more energy mr. breather no you know one

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.980
of the things we might want to do is I can look at the schedule and rebalance

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.910
but now that I am basically working from work more often than not we might

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.010
want to talk about going back to our morning times okay I got some topics to

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.220
go over but I was insulted what I we got a quarterly business review for my org

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.460
with a whole bunch of execs across the company and one of them said Alan your

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:27.990
beard is too long and I said how long is too long he said I don't know but that's

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.340
it but I know it when I see it I know it when I see it and that's too long yeah I

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.810
don't agree with this and I again I we don't have a lot of hierarchy at uni but

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.170
unity uni uni is the new short name right unity but I the words that I consider did

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.810
not come out of my mouth so that was good let's go so I want to lead into some

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.410
questions but first of all I wanted to tell you something I never told you

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.540
before Oh a secret a secret I still think it's the right thing I still think it's

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.740
the right thing so as you know way back in late December early January move the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.580
hosting of the AB testing podcast from self hosting to anchor it on FM that's

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.620
worked out their own by Spotify's worked out very well there were a few little

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.020
glitches at the very beginning but for the most part it's worked I've been

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.420
pretty happy with how well it's worked like no no big complaints but one of

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:38.680
the things you can do is set up you can add supporters which is which means

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.200
people can like sponsor the podcast I've never advertised this and even in the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.360
text on edge I just said you have an option turn it on or off turned it on and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:57.350
then in the text I is like you can customize your listeners support options

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.230
and I said supporting the podcast is completely optional all proceeds go to

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.870
supporting our community through sponsorships scholarships and other

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.630
support for our three listeners so which I believe in so we have a separate

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.070
account now we're an LLC I put any payment I get for speaking for about that

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.270
are that's about modern testing or any other things like that go into this

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.110
account the only thing to pay out of that account is well anchors free so

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.390
nothing there anymore the modern testing org bill is about three dollars a month

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.030
for hosting and then oh then then the yearly domains I put it on I put it on

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.270
AWS and just hosted it myself versus paying for hosting and it's super cheap

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.510
because we get like you know three users a month going there right exactly

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.350
it's the account is there and when things open back up again if I was on

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.110
the ball we should have sponsored someone's ticket for test bash home but

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.430
I didn't think ahead well enough and I got to kind of get more of this

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.720
mindset so the short story is not in it to make money and also a lot of you

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.120
know I am a patreon member of some podcasts and

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.560
cuz I like the podcast want to give them some money and they're doing it as a

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.720
business a little bit different but part of me like one of the reasons I don't

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.900
want to push this and I'm mentioning it because I want to

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.460
reiterate the fact we're not doing this to make money we're doing this whole

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.420
podcast because we want to help people navigate the world of software better

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.580
right so as most of you know it costs zero dollars like there's one

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.340
there's one podcast I listen to where if you sponsor the podcast you can hang out

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.240
with them on a discord channel screw that noise

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.680
I do not want perks ever associated with these sponsorships

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.240
because I think it it creates a class system that it's already

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.320
echoed enough in society I don't want to recreate it in our podcast

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.640
there's actually there's there's there's actually a different

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.120
phenomenon and I forget the author

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.320
but some of the books that I read that led me to behavioral economics which

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.830
then led me to data science right once right now we're producing the

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.110
podcast and I'm and I'm glad that that actually you didn't tell me about

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.470
this and tell now and we'll see later if I

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.270
regret you even telling me now but I'm glad this is entirely optional

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.190
because things change once the reason why you're doing it

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.630
shifts from being a social contract to a fiscal

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:47.960
contract yeah yeah yeah and and I just want to make sure like if someone

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.240
wants to put money in the kitty you'll know where it's going and that's fine I

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.600
do want to do more outreach with the podcast

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.560
but again I'm using all of my probably the canonical example is I made an intro

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.440
to modern testing course for ministry of testing

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.480
get a little chunk of money every quarter there that just goes into our

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.960
ab testing bank account we can use that to

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.160
probably put back in the ministry of testing or

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.200
other sites or things we we care about I don't want to do perks because I think

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.720
it creates a caste system yep and it changes our reason for being

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.640
exactly exactly so it's there I'm not gonna I'm gonna leave it on because I

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.320
think it does help us with reach and I just don't want to

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.080
ever feel like it's anything super special that said

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.280
um we have our actually with me us never

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.640
advertising it someone uh committed to being a sponsor at a

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.840
I think the minimum level which is great I don't want anybody to actually do more

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.040
than that and they may stop after a month one of

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.060
the things you can do on anchor here's the one little perk you get

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.100
and uh if you don't want to sponsor us and still want this same perk I will

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.340
find I'm happy to find a way for you to do it

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.660
in fact I know the way for you to do it so one thing you can do on

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.530
anchor if you sponsor someone is you can leave them a voice message

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.970
and Larry left us a voice message and I'm going I will

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:18.920
I'll play it a little in a little bit and uh but if you don't want to if you

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.560
don't want to do this sponsorship or you don't feel like it you can't afford it

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.400
totally fine but if you want to have your question actually in an audio form

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.000
just send me a freaking wave file or an mp3 and I'll put it on there

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
happy to take your questions in mailbag or anywhere in the one of the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.280
three dot slack comm sorry my dog is bringing me toys now

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.240
and we'll answer your question so anyway uh he left the voice message but

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.680
then he asked the same question same questions in our slack group and

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.120
there were some answers I wanted to go a little bit deeper I thought

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.860
for Larry for anybody else we would have answered these questions anyway

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.260
but I just wanted to tie in how I just it made sense to tie this all together

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.220
and tell this story so thank you Larry appreciate it and

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.300
hopefully the community appreciates it we'll find a way to

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.940
as with everything with ab testing we're just going to find a way to pay

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.190
this forward but uh in the meantime it may be good to

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:18.230
have some discussions about his questions make sense you with me so far

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.900
Brent I am I'm looking at our text and I'm wondering

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.260
on on the supporter thing I'm wondering if you can change it

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:33.560
and just clearly call out you know just click the x in the upper right

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.830
like it defaults to to something I think is way more expensive than anyone should

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.350
okay I've only ever looked at as an administrator so let me find the right

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.200
window again tell me tell me what it should say

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.930
live podcasting as we change our crap okay I'm ready so I'm gonna share screen

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.610
oh god make it hard for me yeah

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.910
yeah yeah I see I see can I choose their own number

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.390
I don't know what happens like those numbers I don't either I don't know what

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.390
happens I guess you click it's like to do this

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.950
right by here you say it's entirely optional and then here you just put

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.870
in parentheses click the x in the upper right

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:14.410
the upper left okay I'm gonna save that and then

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.530
we should probably get going with the question so anyway I wanted to mention

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.850
that because it was contextually seemed appropriate and I wanted to

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.690
congratulate Larry's being the first one and I think again thank you for that

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.690
we're gonna make we're gonna do something fun with that

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:32.570
donation and let me go to where the heck is

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.370
questions but and actually I wanted to start with the third question

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.090
because that's the only left the voicemail about in fact let's listen to

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.770
that message now I have been using design by contract

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:50.330
in the Eiffel programming language using Eiffel studio for about 20 years

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:55.290
I find it very shocking and surprising that in that 20 years

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:03.290
that other mainstream languages java c-sharp python swift go

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:08.650
whatever you have that those languages have not picked up

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.730
design by contract and made it a part of their compiler

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.170
and I'm wondering if you guys can speak to that

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:21.690
issue as to why these major languages have not picked up design by contract

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:28.250
because it's such an outstanding way of ensuring correct behavior between client

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:34.180
and supplier code okay so brent um I've actually have some

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.500
experience here but I want to start with you

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.820
and talk about like what do you know about this design by contract

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.380
do you know anything about it or a little bit about it or have you looked

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:50.390
into it at all uh I have not done any of those things but

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:55.430
in terms of right it the way it's phrased makes it

00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:01.690
sound like it is a a formal acronym like designed by

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.690
contract deep well it's it's a

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:11.050
often referred to as dbc which is an initialism not an acronym but go on

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.450
but interface contract discussions and things like that I've had

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:21.690
lots of discussion around this makes it from the context it feels

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.740
like it's um i'm trying to decide is it is it a

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.860
new sort of agile based technique that i'm just now becoming familiar with or

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.700
is this something closer to sort of the is the assert paradigm that

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:41.780
we've kind of had with us forever it's it's sometimes work it's well they

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.700
often work so right it's very close to the assert paradigm

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.980
and it's in the case of ifel it's the difference with ifel is it's built

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.780
into the programming language i don't know of other languages where it's

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.660
built in as a design construct now i haven't done much programming with ifel

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.220
or no programming with ifel but i'm at least

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.900
somewhat familiar with it and there's a construct i won't go into because

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.540
anyone can google this where in the beginning of your function you

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:16.580
can list basically some requirements that let you validate some inputs as they

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.780
come in which is a good thing to do and make

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:25.060
sure some things are within a range now a whole bunch of stuff to mention there

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.500
though that you want to talk about i'm not going to let you keep my words

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.580
going here this sort of construct we did manually

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.340
so i don't know how actually maybe you didn't maybe you did so i spent a

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.420
chunk of my early career working in the guts of windows and not the deep

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:48.020
guts but the api level guts user mode apis and those were filled

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.940
with on debug builds especially but not entirely

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:57.300
asserts to make sure inputs were valid and expected and within a range

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.380
those weren't all checked it was checked it what kind of word is checked

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.980
those weren't all checked in the retail version but

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.500
running the debug version would catch a lot of poor callers of windows apis

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.700
some of those could be caught later anyway

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.220
asserts just checking inputs that way this is but that's

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.660
using the language or the function or adding like you see a lot of functions

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.900
if i were to look at windows source code today

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.380
a lot of those old apis the first several several lines are filled with

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.260
error correction there was this is available

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.660
within microsoft's implementation of c++ now but

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.580
if you remember the annotations the source code annotations we use for

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.780
prefix and prefast for native code at microsoft

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.540
those are internal tools those source code annotations were a version of

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.740
design by contract it's putting the annotations giving giving and

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.180
again not in the compiler or in the in the runtime but

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.780
at least giving an analysis engine an idea of how parameters were being used

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.860
so they could do a static analysis of the contracts between

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.600
functions makes sense yep and then i don't know how much you've done in c sharp

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.260
uh have you ever used code contracts in c sharp

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:20.020
uh i think so so code contracts in c sharp which are

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.780
they don't let me write code anymore they say alan you're a good manager

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.980
i guess but you certainly have to be a better manager than your encoder so you

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.460
can't do it anymore but same thing um just do uh like contract

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.660
dot requires and you put it's the requirement it's an

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.500
an it looks like an annotation but it's a functional annotation a runtime

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.060
annotation that makes sure that your contracts are

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:48.100
between functions are are observed and enforced for example if

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.740
i'm gonna the canonical example is i have a function called

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.660
a banking function and i'm gonna call deposit or withdraw

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.740
and you test it with the happy path values and everything works

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.900
and then some smart guy like me comes along and decides to

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.820
withdraw negative 500 and i get a little boost to my checking account

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.620
because it's stupid but what we want to do instead is

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.140
through some of my contract requires and again you could do this with code

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.240
also and just reject it but what the contracts do is you can put

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.640
in like contract requires uh withdrawal amount is greater greater

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.830
than zero and it would just fail with it fail with the better error so

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.630
it's it's i believe it's in the diagnostics library

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:42.070
in c in c sharp or net that makes sense it's in some regards so one of the

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:46.710
biggest complaints around using a search is people often use a

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:52.070
search for flow control which is it well and the search don't

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.030
help unless you have retail asserts built in they're not going to help when

00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:00.710
you actually run your code for customers right whereas the contract does seem

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:07.400
to be a a better construct around uh flow control and sort of doing a

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:14.280
search simultaneously that then does have that production benefit now in terms of

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.320
you know the question around our thoughts on that

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.140
as it relates to tdd right i think that's where you're going with the

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.980
conversation eventually i have more examples to give but sure

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.700
oh all right go ahead so i was going to say

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.420
a little bit at unity um back home i'm not sure if it's still being used or

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.580
not but back in the old days when i had a little

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:42.820
qa team that i dissolved side note we were working quite a bit

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:48.340
in part of our business with a very well documented and very cool tool called

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:54.660
packed pact website is pact.io and it's just a

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.740
pretty easy to use test framework that helps you build and

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.420
enforce contracts within a server actually if i remember right it was one

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.220
of the it actually wasn't someone in qa it was

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.540
actually one of the developers driving this

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.140
it was pretty cool it never it never really caught on enough i think to

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.180
get a lot of usage but the people that used it were pretty happy with it

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.260
the usage the availability is there and i think there's probably

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:27.540
i know python has a design by contract library it is not a like iphone is the

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.780
only language i know that it is built into the language and i

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.820
actually looked i was surprised go didn't have this but it doesn't

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.020
but most languages i believe probably have a plug-in

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.540
a extension that would allow you to do something

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.660
similar to design by contract if you if you wish

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.020
and then packed of course is just kind of cool so now

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.830
moving on to the rest of the question right so what

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.110
what dbc is doing if i understand it correct

00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:02.870
is it's basically significantly tightening how it can be called

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.950
right it's putting constraints around its inputs and its outputs

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:13.480
tdd i'm trying to think it so it does seem like it's a different path to get

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.120
there like it is let me summarize often a lot of whether

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.760
it's tdd or just or unit testing without tdd

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.000
right you're a chunk of your unit testing is making sure

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.080
that your happy path works and that your and that some error cases

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.640
are being handled correctly the error cases are automatically handled by

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.800
the contract right you can't pass right you can't pass bad data it's caught by

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.240
the contract right now the data parameters so i don't

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.400
have experience with this one and i and it's funny because you mentioned

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:52.520
iphone and and then when you mentioned it i just flashed back uh because i

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.520
actually i have done programming in iphone in

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.080
college uh and i i just looked up on the internet

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.520
because i was actually surprised the thing's still around and apparently it is

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:12.840
and back in college oh i hated this thing it was part of a class around object-oriented design

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:24.070
and it would go through seven compilation cycles and each cycle was literally

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:30.790
like an hour long like it its compilation phase was painfully slow

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:40.870
i i i brought a real i got really good at looking at the code really carefully before i said compile

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:49.270
and i also brought a book which i completed reading uh during that lab exercise hated that

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:57.590
experience when i think about tdd like certainly one thing about tdd is building up your your

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:07.980
your test suite but the angle like tdd isn't isn't just another way of getting your unit tests

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:15.420
online the the whole purpose of tdd is is essentially the test first approach and

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:21.660
the value add from the test first approach so on that front i'm not yet connecting the dots

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:27.180
around let me let me let me connect some dots okay a lot of people say tdd isn't about testing

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:33.820
and they're right it's not what i've found is when i or people i've worked with do use tdd as an

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:39.180
approach to create their unit tests is they end up designing better code because they have to think

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.740
about their design up front they have to think about what their code does in the first place

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:51.660
right similarly if you if you are designing your contracts which are just asserts up front

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.780
they're also making you think about the way that your code works as you're thinking about your

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.340
parameters first i guess you could write it in a way where you could go back and add that contract

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.460
at the end and then maybe it's not as value valuable so i would say it's the same brent is

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:12.540
continually shoving his fingers in his mouth while we talk it's just it's um and now he's shoving

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:18.860
all but one finger in the middle up his mouth so i would say they're similar if you're designing

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.420
that if you're starting by designing that contract because then you're thinking about the design

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:29.980
otherwise it's similar to unit testing or or other asserts again the value thing i'm curious about

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:39.500
your opinion on is okay so the nice thing around tdd is at the end of the day you get a nicely formed

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:46.200
architecture you get a much more maintainable architecture and the unit test suite yes and

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:52.200
you also get confidence that when you make changes elsewhere that if that those tests continue

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:58.040
to pass that you didn't break anything there's a level of security that comes from a good set

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:05.560
of unit tests whether generated by tdd or not right which make it safer to change code faster the same

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.120
is true if you have these contracts in place because you can't change if you change your

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.480
contract to change underlying api you immediately know everything is broken and you immediately know

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.680
it's not you know at compile time not at runtime i believe that i don't know ifill i

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.200
haven't used iful i haven't even played with this so i don't know for sure but anyway that that's

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.400
the idea okay so if the question is really do any of the languages we know have designed by contract

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:37.160
or something like it and my answer is no i don't know of any that do by design but there's a bunch

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:43.980
of there's a bunch of variations of it including the packed tool that you can use this and i think

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:49.740
it's helpful i if i remember right there was someone at microsoft you can't remember when

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:59.180
working on drivers in windows and they were looking at using a contract to enforce interaction between

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.820
various components in the driver stack i'm not going to go into how windows drivers are built

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:11.180
because i the lie remember it i'm trying to flush it out of my brain yeah i'm i'm saying so to me it

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:17.820
definitely seemed that there's some value proposition with using bbc and i'll go i probably

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.500
don't have enough experience on it but all right but my most relevant and recent experience is

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:29.020
with packed which is a little bit of bolting it on at the end but still helpful still helpful

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.700
especially when you're and packed is kind of made for the microservice world where you have

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.180
a suite of microservices you want to make sure things are complaining well dude i don't know

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:42.710
it i'm gonna you know we're gonna use our um we're gonna use all of our money

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.580
that we make from ab testing it's gonna take a few years to get here but someday we're gonna

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:54.140
fix your nose all right let me let me do another question about the uh quick from

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.940
learning about the theory of constraints all right talks about the old saying a variation of you

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.100
cannot manage what you cannot you can't manage what you can't measure if you're not measuring

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.980
you're not managing that's from mcdonald's university this idea is simple you cannot apply

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.460
theory of constraints or finding constraint bottlenecks if you are not measuring because

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:18.140
the only measurement allows you to id quantity quality or both measurement requires instrumentation

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:23.820
therefore you cannot measure what you don't instrument with you so far once the cicd pipeline

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.780
is instrumented from end to end then one can measure which means one can find bottlenecks

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:34.060
which means you can do something about them question what are the cicd pipeline components

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.900
and how do you instrument them how do you improve your situation from those measurements

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:42.060
i've done this a half a dozen times at least maybe a dozen maybe maybe a hundred

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:48.940
yeah when i am using theory of constraints i'm usually doing it uh through through process

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.580
organization and tickets on the combine board okay let's add let's answer this question instead

00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:00.860
yeah i think i think it's pretty valid so the idea is uh if from the moment code is

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.700
from the moment code is pushed to main there's a pipeline that goes through before it's in

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:12.700
people's running on people's computers in my world we like that time to be less than an hour

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:18.540
like an hour at the most usually that's for a slow pipeline and the pieces of that pipeline are the

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:26.040
build testing deployment to staging whatever extra testing is going to happen in that staging

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.040
environment and we use a staging environment we're not as good at feature flags as i'd like to be

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:37.900
and then that goes live the mistake teams can fall into is they'll go we're gonna spend a bunch of

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:44.380
time to paralyze testing and make sure the testing phase is faster but if the testing phase is already

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:50.140
only 30 seconds it's not your bottleneck so he's absolutely right you want to look at all those

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:55.980
pieces and actually i should back up a step in the overall cycle like here's my code ready to go

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:04.490
it has to be it's going to get reviewed and then built and deployed etc etc etc right now our

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.550
slowest point is probably getting that code review turned around and we're going to measure all the

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:13.750
pieces and i've built little line charts that show the relationship from beginning to end of how

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:19.270
big each chunk is and i'm probably missing some pieces that's mainly it and sometimes

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:23.750
there may be other pre-checks you may have static analysis there's a sonar cube uh pass

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.070
that runs we have some security tools that run so we're going to break all those down every

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:32.710
every single thing and in fact we use jenkins for most of our build pipeline and each of those

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:38.150
is a separate function so it makes it pretty easy for us to measure exactly how long each

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:44.970
little bit of that whole pipeline goes but overall uh theory of constraint says we want to

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.370
mitigate uh whatever the biggest constraint is until it isn't the biggest constraint anymore

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:55.050
and then repeat well for us the way it works is as i i hadn't thought about it before i started

00:28:55.050 --> 00:29:01.620
talking through it but everything's a job and or a function in jenkins and they all get their own

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.100
like you can look at them in the even if we didn't measure if you want to know how long your

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:12.180
particular build took you could look in the ui and see everything that happened along the way

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:19.780
and how long it took and what we can do from my team overall is get those in aggregate so we can

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:26.820
get a media a mean and median per repo per service and show what that is and show who's and maybe

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:33.300
target like whoa this team's build takes an hour what the hell and go follow up with them and help

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:37.640
them out but more often than not they'll come they'll come to me and our team and say hey our

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.080
build's taking an hour do you have some people that can help we do the similar thing it's it's

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:52.520
essentially that you don't like the way larry asks the question right kind of implies that

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:59.720
instrument the cicb pipeline from end to end which kind of implies a degree of complexity

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:05.080
that you may not actually need a lot of the times if you just go okay every everything

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:12.680
through the flow has these these common phases identify your phases and then just measure

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:21.000
starting end of each phase and the the time in between there's a lot of systems like if you recall

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.200
in the old days there's like gauntlet systems that will go and do check games and parallelize

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.160
right you also want to measure how long things if there's a queue you want to measure how long

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:38.120
things are sitting in the queue right because all of this is is idle time that's blocking the

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:47.000
thing from going out the door and even then like like what you described was what maybe five distinct

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.400
different yeah there may be more from build the build just depends on what you're what you need

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.840
to do with that build we may have extra checks you want to do there and it may be like one of

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:03.160
the static analysis tools is really slow but you just i guess i the way i would instrument that so

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.960
the tool is instrumented for us in a way but it'd be easy if not it'd be easy to add it i've done

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:15.240
that before as well but if like one step was taken in ordinarily long you probably want to look at

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.560
that step and maybe break it down so you can see which are the long parts of that long step to

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.520
figure out where to focus like if the static analysis step i'll just pick that example was

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:31.340
45 seconds or a minute which is kind of a long time but maybe there's five tools that run there

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:37.980
i will look and see if one of those was particularly slow or if if maybe i have a ton of stuff i want

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.460
to run and they take a long time and i'm doing all sorts of lookups and it takes two minutes to

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.980
run that maybe we can run it's it's running off a static code it's static analysis but that means

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:55.660
we can run those in parallel if i need to if that's my bottleneck my team i i hired a new kid

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:04.900
last tribuary who who sort of had experience on on in a in a build environment at his prior company

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:13.460
then you wanted to learn to to to do data science work as i think i've told you before i i i do

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:19.300
this i'm full stack right where one way to view it is we're a dev team that specializes in data

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:26.580
science like i i operate services and one of the things i had to have him invent is essentially

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:35.700
hey i need a i need a a model build process even though models aren't really built in sort of the

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:42.260
same traditional fashion i need a model build process and what he did is he went to actually

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:52.980
ado uh and they have a great facility there active data objects no what's ado azure dev ops

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:59.940
azure devops oh by the way i saw a really cool talk from someone um from that team talking about it

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:06.820
and even they in their public talk said it was a stupid name because it is and the fact that i say

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:14.260
ado and then you're trying to you're trying to sneak that by me right geezers like us will go

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:21.980
oh active data objects right which i actually i don't even think anyone uses anymore so he's

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:30.140
strung it together through what they have is um uh so azure devops pipelines that so they have

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:36.460
infrastructure in there and so we can independently draw together each individual step

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:41.740
and as those steps execute or fail we automatically get all of that telemetry so

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:49.910
that's that's one thing that's nice in terms of the infrared that i am on which is the the

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:57.030
essentially the azure slash microsoft stuff that does those value propositions just now come to us

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:05.110
for free so a lot of it is you don't even need to if you pick the right pipelining tech you you may

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:11.540
already have these things and you don't need to go in and re-implement you just need to figure out

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:18.660
okay where where is all the the telemetry being stored for my team's processes the short answer is

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:25.540
you just measure the beginning and the end and then if it's not a number you like you

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:30.340
find more things to measure in between there until you're measuring enough things in that system

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.420
where you feel like you can find the bottlenecks or you may just decide that's as fast as we're

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.140
going to get or that's all that's worthwhile the investment that's worthwhile yeah return on

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:43.460
investment so i wanted the last question which uh again is going to involve some stuff we don't

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.500
use a lot so it says a number of empirical studies using function points have shown that

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.900
software defects first arrive in a design during initial requirement gathering and design

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.940
specification writing so yes i think anecdotally we could say yeah a lot of times the design is

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:03.540
wrong so the question is how can you use a theory of constraints instrumenting and measuring the

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.260
non-technical specification creation part of your projects before any code is actually written

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:15.220
and my answer here is i'm not sure that theory of constraints i'm not sure there's a bottleneck

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:20.260
but before i lead you any farther how would you answer that question how would you use theory of

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:27.380
constraints instrumenting and measure the non-technical specification creation part of your

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:36.020
projects before any actual well so it's essentially how do we measure whether the non-technical

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:43.160
specification part of the project is actually the bottleneck how do we determine that that i think

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:49.240
that's kind of the point again i would say like obviously you can't do the best of my knowledge

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:57.320
i mean there might be by now ways to instrument specs but again if we think of it as phases with

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:06.890
a distinct start and end then then the typical azure process is you're measuring the cycle time

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:14.090
between an idea the time it takes for an idea to get out to production okay now with that in

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:24.010
mind if your team has like a deep technical requirements gathering phase uh that's a

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:29.910
that's a requirement then you you just say okay well the start time is when the person starts

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:36.410
writing this when they get it done and you you evaluate it against everything else in your

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:43.400
pipeline like an mvp i spend a lot of time talking about this with some of my folks like an mvp

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:50.230
um we want to get that out and actually use usage and things like that to sort of dry the requirements

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:57.510
so the requirement phase in in my my team's projects are essentially hey what's the our best

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:03.510
guess that we want to bootstrap the final project with right what's the minimum set of things that

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:09.530
we want to get out so that we can then start bootstrapping and iterating and adjusting our

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:17.770
direction and at the time it takes to to document that is like two to three times it takes to get

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:23.770
the code out then then we got a problem right and maybe it's worth i'm actually going to just build

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:28.650
on that and go off in a little slightly different direction but yeah i guess it depends if you're

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:37.130
doing work where where it's a long waterfully cycle and you need you need the design approved

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:43.530
upfront i've read the research and in projects like that and what i would agree with is for this

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:50.570
measurement is this is true for projects where a big design upfront is required as i've mentioned

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:57.130
before my teams all do p50 estimates mean they pick an estimate 50% probability and the reason

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:03.690
for that is it is a sweet spot between over planning and over designing and just doing

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:09.050
something it works out pretty well overall we can get stuff out faster but we get it out

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:13.850
at a point where we can get feedback through instrumentation to understand if we've built

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:21.130
the right thing so the design we do the biggest design practice we do is we get everyone very

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:26.490
before we even like day one of the planning is get everyone aligned on the problem we're solving

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:33.050
if everyone agrees like this is the problem we want to solve then honestly that's the bulk of

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:38.100
our design yeah and then and someone comes out of like which implementation do we choose but

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.380
everything focuses on what's the best way to solve this problem for the customer and then

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:49.620
ask questions like how will we know if the customer is being successful with the solution

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.700
and that that drives the instrumentation that we're going to add to make sure that that's

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.780
being done we do that for a lot of internal tools as well as the external stuff we ship

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:03.860
so and that's kind of it so in the world i live in and you for the large part we're delivering

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:11.540
so often that i think we're actually i hate to do the snowflake argument but despite the research

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:18.180
showing that defects arrive during design maybe it's the same thing i'm all over the place here

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:23.700
but i think services are different i think when you if you are and not just services are different

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:29.780
if you practice shipping frequently and are comfortable enough with your data and your

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:35.380
ability to turn around that you can ship something that you know is not complete or you know is not

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:41.540
ready but you're okay with that that gives you a huge competitive advantage right so that's it

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.580
that's my design like we're shipping i can't tell you what we're shipping because it's not an

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:49.380
ounce but my team is shipping something very soon we were going to soft launch it got some

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.540
feedback from the design team said hey before you do it can you do this these 10 things make it

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.820
pretty and i said yeah we'll do them we're going to actually do the top few and then we're going

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.340
to ship and we'll we'll keep on changing things and gathering feedback so we want to get that

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.740
feedback as well there's the eric reese i think quote that says show me a product that ship

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.240
without any bugs i'll show you something that shipped too late so there's a balance there

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:16.280
for sure like i want that feedback i want i want to be feedback driven and real-time feedback driven

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:22.760
and i also know we can we can update this particular thing a dozen 15 20 times a day if

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:34.020
we need to yeah i completely agree like part of his discussion in this is right it kind of presumes

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:41.460
i don't know to me it feels a bit waterfally and i'm wondering i don't know if it's a waterfall it's

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:48.420
it's it's formal it is formal right and if that's part of the if if the requirement gathering stuff

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:55.300
right you you you determine when it's enters and exits the phase and and i would like to point out

00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:03.610
and maybe we're wrong i mean this reads as formal or waterfally which are i mean modern testing is

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:11.210
informal and super adaptive so the fact that he's asking these questions and getting value from the

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.730
stuff we're talking about and working in a different environment that's fantastic and maybe

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:22.490
there's a lot more context larry has here but uh i'm actually super happy with the engagement

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:28.170
and the questions i think it's really cool so if you are out there and you think yeah i like you

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:36.090
guys are all right i guess you know allen's kind of a dick and brent breathes too loud but whatever

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:42.170
if there's a question you want to ask just fire it away email twitter one of the three.slack.com

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:48.330
whatever i'd like to have more of these kinds of questions because it makes us think makes us think

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.730
about how what we're doing can apply to a bigger part of the bubble right and hopefully it's

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.370
helpful i guess yeah this is i gotta tell you brent is now slumped with out of his chair all i see

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:03.290
i don't even see his eyes i see like just his forehead his i get tired of his few strands of

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:09.050
hair that has remaining and uh the top of his headphones we have to go we have to go back to

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:14.630
doing the youtube live casts just so people can see what i have to deal with yeah it's

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:23.030
i'll just tell everyone no matter what you think it is it's worse oh everyone should feel empathy

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:27.830
for ellen we got like one minute and i'm gonna do a plug here i don't think we've talked have

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:35.370
we talked since i did the oh my god we haven't since i did the ama with uh test bash home no

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:40.890
actually we haven't talked oh we should have talked about that because it was good uh did i yeah

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:47.850
so i i lost my let me tell you my future of automation and you won't get a chance to make a

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:54.280
uh do i have it here limit let me why you're loading it up or thinking about it i'll say

00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:01.720
right miss chrispin right weighed in and and absolutely voiced that you were killing it

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:07.400
on the discussion but yeah i totally forgot about that all right yeah yeah i totally forgot what

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.800
they were but let's talk about that next time a little bit and in the meantime if you're a member

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.840
uh a pro member of ministry of testing go check out the talk and send us some feedback and

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:24.360
questions i was not um uncontroversial you were not but people thought people thought i made sense

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:33.160
anyway which is great well so that's kind of our our thing like we're like we actually think

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.640
we're not actually stating anything controversial we're just stating things that are well i was a

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.520
little bit looking forward but uh anyway let's talk about it next time i gotta run so uh once

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:52.440
again i am the one and only not the one and only i'm the uh i'm one of the world's allens

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.260
um i am not see you later everybody bye
