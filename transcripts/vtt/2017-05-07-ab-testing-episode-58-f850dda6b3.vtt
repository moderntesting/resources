WEBVTT

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.500
Hey, it's Alan.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
It's Brent.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
And we're back for 58.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.460
58 what?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.300
Episode number 58.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Episode 58.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.300
S'quentaiocho.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.260
Oh, I get it.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.380
He's speaking a foreign language because today is Cinco de Mayo.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.660
Woo hoo.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.060
Which is for those of you not multilingual like Brent and I.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.060
Stands for May 5th and May 5th is Spanish I believe for tacos and tequila.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.060
It is.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.820
Now, curiosity, what sort of tacos do you eat?

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.880
Oh, like restaurants or when I make tacos myself?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.440
Yeah, like what's a tofu taco?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
Ah, dude.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.440
Yeah, I know.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.440
Oh, fish tacos.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.520
You can eat those.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.520
Those are worth eating.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.520
Vegiquarian.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.680
So, going out, taco d'Aumard is of course good.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.720
I prefer to make my tacos at home.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.940
Are you corn or flour taco?

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.940
Depends.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.940
Well, that's the right answer.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.920
I kind of, I kind of go through phases to tell you the truth.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.920
In my humble opinion, it's not a taco if it's on a flour tortilla.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.920
Yeah, kind of.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920
It's something else, right?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.920
It's a spajita or a...

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.920
Burrito.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920
An unrolled burrito.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.920
Something.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.000
Yeah, I prefer the corn tortillas too.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Soft or hard?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140
I get your mind out of the gutter.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.140
Again, no preference.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
It depends on the taco.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.700
It kind of does.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.700
Wow.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.700
We have really expressed our opinions deeply here on the topic.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700
Tequila.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.050
Yes.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.050
What kind?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.180
Blanco Reposado Anejo.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.680
I generally go with Anejo.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.340
I'm no longer in college and I can afford the good stuff.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340
Yeah, I do not like the...

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.340
I do not drink the Blanco Tequila.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.340
It's just, I need a little bit of flavor to my tequila.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.460
I don't mind sipping tequilas.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.460
I'm beyond like shots of tequila.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.620
As faithful listeners know, Brent, as a going away present from Microsoft, gave me a wonderful

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.620
bottle of tequila.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.620
Tequila.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.620
Tequila.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.620
That's the male version of tequila.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.620
Exactly.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620
It's extra manly.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.780
Which there's still some left.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.100
Really?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.740
Yeah, it's a nice sipping tequila.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.740
You can't sip every night.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.700
I mean, my view is if you use tequila...

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700
It doesn't go bad.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.700
If you use tequila...

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.700
No, it does not.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.730
But if you use tequila for mixed drinks, you want to start with a sipping tequila.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.730
Yeah, and to be clear, when we make margaritas at home, it is good tequila.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.730
None of this margarita mix, that's for college, all right?

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.730
Nothing processed or stripped you use.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.920
All it's in the my margaritas is tequila, Cointreau, Orange liqueur from France, and lime.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.920
Fresh lime.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
Not out of the little plastic thing that looks like a lime.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.920
Fresh squeezed lime, Cointreau, tequila, shaking over ice.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.920
Oh, so good.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.920
But now...

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.920
Yeah, shall we pause and go to the grocery store?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.240
You know, usually I don't drink before 9, but today's it's Friday.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.240
What the hell?

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.240
Cinco de Mayo.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
It is.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.590
We have a podcast.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.590
We do.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.590
We do.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.620
Do you want to do that today or just...

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.460
I'm spending the time.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.460
I mean, we might as well understand this.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.460
Whatever.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.460
Hey, so we...

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.460
This is 58, and our last episode was 57.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.460
And I thought maybe we could talk just a little bit about 57 because it was an experiment

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.460
for us that was definitely a learning experience.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.800
Maybe not in hindsight what...maybe the best thing we wanted for our listeners.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.040
Not that it was to be fully clear.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040
I like Hans.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.550
I think he's professional, very, very well versed in his craft.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.550
Knows his stuff.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.830
But maybe not...wasn't in hindsight wasn't the best match for the style of A-B testing.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.000
Yeah, I agree.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.680
As listeners know, we're not afraid to try things out.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.120
My previous least favorite episode was the one we did at Redfin where we said, hey, let's

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.680
do a podcast and a presentation simultaneously.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.160
I'm not aware of too many people doing that.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.000
I think we may have learned why.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.220
Yesterday, or the last episode...

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.220
That wasn't yesterday, it was last week.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220
Yeah, it's still fresh.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:11.410
You know, it was our first time doing a call-in...

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.410
Guest, yeah.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.410
It was a little different.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.410
When we had Steve Rowe on the show, he was in the room with us, allowed for some more

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.410
interaction.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.880
I had kind of hoped originally that we would have a little bit more interaction with Hans.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.440
I blew that a little bit by having a half a dozen prepared questions.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.800
Originally, I viewed those as sort of like our Kanban board, but we didn't really get

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.360
into a discussion.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.200
I think it's a little bit because we're not quite in the same world of testing as Hans.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.480
I don't know if it was the phone.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.860
I'm not quite sure what combination it was, but it just didn't feel like a typical A-B

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.860
testing podcast.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.420
With lots of good information, we even had one of the three say he liked it and there's

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.020
good information there, so I'm happy there.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.740
Yeah, but the feedback from the three was...

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.740
The other two.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.700
Yeah, the other two of the three, their feedback was essentially aligned, I think, more closely

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.870
to how we felt about it.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:28.220
That it wasn't that sort of interview style with the type of information that was being

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.210
communicated isn't a great alignment for the A-B testing podcast.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.210
It isn't.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.690
I would, and I'm going to put this out here now, I would like to try another remote guest

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:47.650
sometime that we think will be a little bit more interactive and a little less structured

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.770
if someone that can handle that format and see if we can pull it off.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.770
Because I'd love to have guests in once in a while and subject them to the A-B onslaught

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.490
of idiocy.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.180
But I want to make sure it's going to require...

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.020
It's a narrower set of people than the world.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.020
For sure.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.620
For sure.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.140
You and I have talked of who I think is a good candidate for that.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.060
Yeah, I think it'd be a good one we can get him on.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.460
But also, the three, if you have suggestions.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.420
I think that could be something we do from time to time.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.340
I don't want to make it A-B and guest testing.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:32.780
But I think it's, for the sake of variety and just getting some more opinions, as long

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:40.530
as we can do it with dialogue and discussion with the A-B style of shit flipping, I think

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.610
it'll work out.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.550
I do think that's the next sort of guest that we do.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:59.440
They need to realize that there's an informality on the A-B testing podcast as well as what

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.560
our listeners are looking for.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:10.140
What differentiates us, in my view, from the other testing podcasts is, in a nutshell, we're

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:20.740
saying to exaggerate, we're essentially saying everything you learned about testing before

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.920
is not really valid as much as it used to be or not valid at all.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.400
Yeah, a lot's changing.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.840
You got through that well without saying testing is dead.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.360
There is a quality revolution at foot.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360
There is.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360
There is.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.620
You can embrace it and ride it or you can just STFU, I guess.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.620
Yeah.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:58.550
Plus, we had our typical unfair share of equipment issues pulling that together.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:06.860
It was, in my view, there was some good content there for those who have an interest in that

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.260
space.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:17.530
I don't think in general the people who are attracted to our podcast are interested in

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.690
learning that content.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:26.140
There's other podcasts like that and people who want sort of the direct interview style.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.620
There's lots of those out there.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.740
I think we're on the same page, I think, with many of the listeners.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.740
Is that great information?

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.860
It didn't feel like an A-B testing podcast.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.990
It was an interview podcast that happened to include Alan and Brent.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.150
We're going to continue to experiment once in a while, but most of the time, it will

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.340
just be us yelling at each other.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:55.330
Well, again, we need to figure out how to make the informal style move across the wall

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:04.580
to guess, pre-inform them that, hey, this is what you should expect.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:10.460
That horse has been beaten, but thanks for letting us reflect and dwell on that.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.300
Shall we move on to the next item?

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.300
Yes.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.300
Not all of what I'm doing as a manager at Unity.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.300
Oh, wait.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.300
Alan talks about working at Unity.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:28.020
I don't have a fancy sound or sound effect for that, but that's what we're going to use.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:35.900
I have liberally and massively pushed the Brent line on testing is, roll of tester is

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.500
to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.340
I love using that because it's generic enough, yet specific enough to apply across what I

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.900
want to do.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.780
One thing I'm sure I've talked about before.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.780
Drink.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.780
I'll take one later.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Sinko De Mayo.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.330
Sinko De Mayo!

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:06.170
It's that my QA org at Unity is everyone on the team minus my three leads are embedded

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.690
as members of feature teams.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:08.810
They're part of the feature team.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.540
I consider them to be the quality and testing expert on that feature team.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.800
So then the question is, this is leading somewhere, the question is then, they're all working

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800
within a feature team.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.840
I have one on ones with the feature team lead, but they all report up through me.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.760
So it's an odd organizational structure.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.010
So in my mind, I view it as I don't run a QA organization.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:44.890
I run a QA community, meaning that we can leverage each other to learn for some other

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.890
things.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.930
I want to talk a little bit more about that.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.370
In this sort of organization, I mentioned Community DeBrent, I think in passing last week.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.750
He goes, I don't know if I agree with that.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.030
I think he might have said I was stupid.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.030
I can't remember.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.430
It was somewhere in between there.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.990
But I said, hey, let's discuss that on air next time.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.150
Let's be real.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.990
When I tell you I don't agree with that, it's the same thing.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.990
Yeah.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.230
It's what I hear versus what you're saying.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.300
No, and what I'm telling you, it's the same thing.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.300
Yeah, I know.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.300
Okay.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.300
Yeah.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.300
So I'm going to start off with these.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.840
This is our 58th damn episode.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.640
Of course, I did one without you.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.680
Remember?

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.680
Yeah, it's not our 58th.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.680
Remember?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.680
Remember?

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680
Remember?

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680
Remember?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.480
Just to bring 57 back, it's our 57th.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:41.340
So I will elaborate more on why I like that metaphor, or maybe it's not a metaphor, why

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.620
I like the concept of my org as community.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.460
But I'm curious now, because I haven't heard it before, why you think that may not be the

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:54.260
best way to describe what I have, and there's a better way to do that.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:03.920
So I actually, so Alan told me, I don't know, a week ago that he wanted to talk about this,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.240
and I promised that I would do some research on this.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.820
And then I remember this is the AB.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.100
I remember this is the AB testing podcast.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.360
So yeah, I didn't do that.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.820
Or it could have just been, I forgot, or I'm lazy.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820
Well, you know, whatever.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.880
Oh, we can do a poll.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880
Is Brent lazy?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.880
Did he forget?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.470
Or is he just stupid?

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.470
Know all of the above?

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.470
Okay.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.470
D. Go on.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.470
Go on.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.470
All right.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:41.640
So a couple of things.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:56.800
First and foremost, like what you describe, tell me in your view, how is, how what you're

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:07.040
doing right now or how it's organized right now, how it's any different from the, just

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:14.920
to make this extra painful, the organizational structure pushed down on Microsoft by the

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:21.270
Office and Windows orgs, otherwise known as the functional org, where all the QA reports

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:27.330
to one discipline, but they're all expected to work together with members of the other

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.070
discipline.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.790
You mean like traditional Microsoft, like triad org?

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.790
Yep.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:40.290
I think the difference is, is that in that world, the test manager ran this test org

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.290
and they ran them independently.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:47.310
And of course they worked across, but their work wasn't dictated by the rest of the feature

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.220
team, the developers on that feature team.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.690
It wasn't?

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.050
Not that much, no.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.050
Maybe not explicitly.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.050
So.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.030
Implicitly, it sure the hell was.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.690
I don't know if that was consistent across the board.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.570
I think that.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.570
Come on.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.800
How many times, like I faced over and over again.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.160
Hey, we only have a month.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.470
This is the whole reason why the test compression thing happened in that world all the damn time.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:25.390
That was functioning in a typical waterfall model where they threw shit over the wall to

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.390
the test team.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.390
Right.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.510
If here's my shit, test it.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.830
And they tested the crap out of it.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.390
Here are the bugs and they fixed the bugs and the codependency went on and on until

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.270
they had this year long stabilization in office especially.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.320
And when that was over, they shipped.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320
Okay.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:48.980
So one key difference could be is essentially you're underfunding the feature teams in terms

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.540
of their QA folks so that they can't do that behavior.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.660
If you're assigning basically QA coaches to all of these feature teams, right, then.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.660
Right.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.100
And they do, and to be fair, they do plenty of testing.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.660
They're doing, they're not writing the unit test for the developers as many of those office

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.280
testers did.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.820
They are working with the dev team to.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.540
I had repressed that.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.220
Understand what testing needs to get done.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.740
They're definitely not writing unit tests.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.220
They're writing some integration tests, looking at some end-to-end scenarios, looking at

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.460
what can fail, looking at customer data.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.460
They're just, they're doing what they can to accelerate the achievement of shipable

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.780
quality.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:35.900
But they're very tightly knit in a team of, you know, six, seven, at most eight people.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.600
And it could be the difference between functioning that way within an agile team versus the waterfall

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.160
teams that Microsoft had.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.400
But what they do is they're much more, imagine if you had, if I was going to build a team

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.040
nav, I'm going to have a startup.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040
I have eight people.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.060
Say I'm going to hire seven people.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.220
I'm going to hire, I want to hire diverse.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.340
I want to hire specialized and generalists.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.760
And one of those people is going to be able to specialize in testing quality issues.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:09.020
And that's how each of my feature teams is structured now.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:15.970
So the question is then that I, that I've been asked by one, just in one part of my

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:21.790
org is, well, why would, why wouldn't they all just report to the dev manager?

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.990
All their work comes from there.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.070
And this is where my concept to community comes in.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.430
This is why I feel as a community more than an organization, because the benefit I provide

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:36.570
in running this org is in with my experience in the testing world is making

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.650
connections between people in the QA orgs.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.370
They can learn new concepts from each other.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.450
As we, anybody listening to this podcast knows testing is much more complex.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.530
It's an iceberg of stuff.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.650
There's a metaphor there, but it's good.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.770
Testing is much more complex than it appears on the surface.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.300
And I want in order for my team to grow and get better at doing what they do,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.600
being the quality coach, the accelerator, whatever, they need to be able to learn

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.440
from each other and I want to provide a mechanism for which to learn.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.940
And what I'm providing is going to the five orders of ignorance, look them up.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:16.640
I'm not going through them all is a suitable method to learn what you don't know.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.400
You don't know.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.770
That's what my community provides is, is, is a way, if you discover what you

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.570
don't know, you don't know.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.130
So you can go, Oh, I didn't know that.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.850
Now I know it.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.650
That is a method of, of course, knowledge acquisition.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.870
So I'm using community as a way of facilitating learning.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.150
I get, I get, I get where you're coming from.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:42.720
And I do agree that the community aspect is going to be important for success.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.240
Yeah.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.580
Let me, let me just interrupt it.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.880
I'm going to read the definition of community before my eyes fade.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.400
And then you can go on the applicable definition, a feeling of fellowship with

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.040
others as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.350
Yeah.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:05.130
And as a QA organization, we absolutely must have and do that.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.000
So it's, um, it's MS poll season.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.040
Oh God.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.800
At Microsoft.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.000
I miss it so much.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.280
Please let me take the Microsoft poll.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.520
So I may fill out data that my managers may poo-poo and ignore or throw a

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.560
morale event on the day of the poll to skew the results.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.670
Or quickly pull together.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:38.110
A very quick reactionary, uh, meeting shortly after that, so that a year from now,

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.450
management can take credit for taking action based off of the poll.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:42.970
Yeah.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.190
My experience of poll results is take immediate credit for anything that

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.610
improves and, uh, dismiss the rest as an anomaly.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:52.920
Yeah.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.080
It's actually, actually that is, uh,

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.920
I didn't mean to rag on Microsoft, but it was like Brent put a softball up

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.060
there as big as a beach ball.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.620
And I had a big bat.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.020
No.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:13.860
So you just described actually, uh, the, the, and another way of framing the

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.760
main problem with entity metrics.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:22.860
Cause that happens pretty much every time with entity metrics.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.300
Lots of common bias.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.660
I'm going to, uh, believe the parts I like and discard the points I don't.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.260
One of my favorite ones.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.300
Like I, um, just as an aside, something we kind of do here.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:42.960
Um, there's been this one metric that I've been watching, uh, and

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.680
watching, uh, PM behavior.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.540
And I noticed that the metric is sinusoidal.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.890
So it goes up and down and up and down, up and down almost

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.630
exactly to the reporting cadence.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:08.240
So in, in one month, it'll be up the next month, it'll be down the next

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.780
month, it'll be up the next month.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.460
It'll be down.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:11.960
Okay.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.600
And it's, it's been fun.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.520
Um, there was this one PM that was responsible for presenting it.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:29.300
And, um, I pulled her aside and I said, after observing, she's relatively

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.760
new and after observing what was going on, I'm like, can I show you

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:40.450
something because what, every time it was up, Hey, yell our, our

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.090
implementation.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:47.530
So last month I reported that, that everything was in the can and this

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.990
is what we did and look, it's up.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.090
Yay us.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:58.130
And then the next month it was, yeah, we don't, this appears to be an outlier.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.650
We're not certain what actually caused this.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.490
So, and we're going to do some investigation and then the next month,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.510
Hey, so we investigated it.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:07.670
Oh my God.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.830
And I'm just like, you got to look at the pattern as a whole.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:17.610
And really the pattern as a whole, as like if I said, like we would need to do a

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:23.210
drill down and, um, probably do some AB testing on these things or, or,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.850
what are the other kinds of AB testing?

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.770
There are many.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.000
Yeah.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.500
Just for a second.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:42.000
Do, um, we would want to, to decompose the data a bit differently to, to say,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.680
to statistically validate that when we say it's having an improvement, it's

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.080
actually having an improvement because just looking at this, I'm going to say,

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.080
no, everything we've done, just looking at this trend, everything we've done

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.280
has had no effect and actually there's some other pattern that's happening.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:06.870
Now it's, it is entirely possible that when it's on the high, it's also

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.150
could be like every time it's on the high, that's actually, Hey, we really

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:14.790
improved and so dev gets sloppy and then breaks it, but the fact that it's a,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.390
it's a recurring pattern that's up and down, I'm like, yeah, I don't think that's

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.110
true anyway, back to community.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.430
Oh no, before we get there, uh, it reminds me, I haven't visited that,

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.970
that site that shows, uh, causation without correlation, correlation without

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.570
causation, like murders coincide with, um, Johnny Depp movies.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.030
Right.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:36.550
Yeah.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:43.130
I will try and find it for the show notes, but it's a great example of how

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.830
you can, uh, yeah, of this actually.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.050
Yeah.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:56.950
And there's, there are ways to actually, um, tell the truth better.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.990
I actually, uh, my, um, without using alternative facts, are we, are we.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.060
Right there, but it takes analysis.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.640
It takes realizing what you're doing.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:16.880
Like, um, my PM, he and I spent two hours yesterday on what should be a simple

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.920
problem, but as we sat down and sort of decomposed it, we realized, Nope,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:29.020
this is much harder, um, to prove like what we're trying to do.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:36.450
Um, we have a new UI and what we're trying to prove is that this new

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:42.390
yet UI is preventing people from creating CSS tickets.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.410
Okay.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.990
Okay.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.930
And their initial metric was very simple.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:53.150
If they can, if they get to a certain point in the flow and then they cancel

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.490
out of it, yay, pat ourselves on the back.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:04.540
And I'm like, um, there are other reasons why they could be canceling.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.320
Well, we need to do a comparison of like, if the canceling with this, this,

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.420
with this new UI behavior, if the rate of canceling with this new UI

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.940
behavior is roughly equivalent to the rate of canceling without this new UI behavior.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.120
Yeah.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.340
Uh, no, that's just curiosity.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.900
Most likely, right?

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.980
Not an actual, yay, pat ourselves on the back, uh, adventure.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:42.120
Um, but we, we came up with, uh, an interesting approach, um, and one where

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.980
we can analyze like what's happening with the customer behavior.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:52.120
And, and if we don't like the numbers, it, uh, in certain places, we now

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.320
know exactly where to drill in to further explain what's happening so

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:03.820
that we can publish, uh, a back, a backlog of improvements by ROI behavior.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:10.670
Like, um, this is customer behavior stuff and I love this work.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.610
It's not on my backlog.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:18.670
So, um, and my team yells at me when I pick up a shiny thing.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.470
So I, I'm, I know what I'm going to be doing this weekend.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:23.910
All right.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.670
Anyway, can we go back to community?

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:26.510
Yeah.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.990
All right.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.710
Yeah, we can now.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:32.250
Um, so my problem with how you phrased it.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.450
So I completely agree community is going to be an important part of this.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.130
Oh, um, now I remember why I went on the sidetrack.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.570
So we did the MS poll.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.610
Oh yeah.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:41.930
Yeah.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.980
15 minutes ago.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.620
You have, you have to unstack, you have to unwind the stack in order.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.540
So MS poll, MS poll.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.380
We already made fun of it.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.820
Um, can't guarantee we're done.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.460
Couple of the feedback.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.280
So we, uh, uh, my manager runs a data science team as do I.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:10.300
And one of the things that popped in the poll was a need for better collaboration

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.700
and better innovation.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:25.810
And, um, we had one of our lower level ICs sort of drive the MS poll deconstruction.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:32.310
Now, one of the problems I had actually with it, with it, and it's fascinating.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:39.570
Like I work with a bunch of data scientists, but they are, I don't know.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.730
It just turns out the data scientists are human too.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:50.990
And, um, like I, for now, you know, five years from now that might change.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:28:04.460
But the, the, what I have is a built up through my training is, uh, after I've

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.820
think through something, I go, okay.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:14.220
Now what biases have been put into play that are going to invalidate my results

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.620
before I go off and, and gather this data, right?

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:25.980
So this poor kid had had a discussion with, with my manager and my manager

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.780
primed him with what the big problems are.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.270
And so when he got the team together to decompose, they went into problem

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.150
solving mode on those problems.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.680
Instead of them communicating what they view, what's the biggest problems.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:42.480
Right.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:48.500
I'm just like, okay, this isn't going to go well because, um, just because

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.280
the manager thinks it's the biggest problem.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.960
And that's generally because, Hey, on MS-Pola scored low doesn't mean

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.980
the employees actually care or it's the biggest problem to the employees.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.980
Anyway, collaboration and innovation.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.820
And one of the things I told him, I'm like, Oh, that's interesting.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.680
And he said, well, why?

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:16.620
And I got to, uh, do something with him that the listeners of A.B.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:23.040
testing know, and that is on the topic of innovation, where do new ideas come from?

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.610
They come from other ideas, Brent.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.370
Yes.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:34.150
So if you don't have a collaborative environment, what likely is your

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.410
environment like on the topic of innovation?

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:41.490
Uh, without any collaboration, your, uh, opportunity for innovation,

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.090
I would say is very small.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:53.410
You, you are relying on, um, a much smaller set of people who will go off and do their

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.050
learning themselves offline.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.070
Absolutely.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.850
Um, so you're relying on, I don't know, innovation heroes.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:05.050
I think collaboration is essential and, and communication and just sharing

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.370
whatever is essential for innovation.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:08.430
Yeah.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:12.970
Why, why I have a community go on collaboration, knowledge sharing

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:22.740
are critical to two big, important things, innovation and productively, um, reducing,

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.550
uh, maintenance costs and, and duplication of effort.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.150
Sure.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.710
Right.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:35.930
Now I almost didn't say duplication of effort, um, because I am not one of those

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.030
people who say duplication of effort is evil always.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.090
Um, who would say that?

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.950
Lots of, lots of, lots of people.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.870
Well, they're stupid.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:51.370
No, I mean, you've not been, I agree, but have you not been in a meeting where someone's

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.590
like, Alan, you're duplicating effort.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.630
And that's, and they view that as the coup de gras winning stroke for the

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:57.010
argument.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.290
I'm not, I, they're stupid too.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.730
Right.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.770
So you don't get a pass.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:10.590
I do think knowledge sharing is critical, but when you're talking about, um, when

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:15.690
you're talking about you as the re the, the manager of a reporting structure,

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:23.460
um, saying that you're, you're essentially a community organizer.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.110
Not entirely, but largely.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.310
Yeah.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.360
Um, I don't know.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.800
It feels weird saying that in some, in a, in a formal structure.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:42.880
What I think, uh, and the other thing too is you're also saying, um, and,

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:49.340
and you're exceptional at community organization on, um, particularly on the

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:56.880
quality knowledge sharing topic, you want to drive action to some degree.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:57.720
Yeah.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.600
And then the knowledge sharing aspects, there's a high degree of

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:09.900
optionality in there, if, if you're going to have, uh, them sort of take command

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.840
from the PO of their individual feature team or whatever the structure is that unity.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.900
I'm actually thinking what you want to do is formalize that a bit more and, and

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:25.160
leverage, um, matrix organization style.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:25.720
Yeah.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.880
I think there's nothing wrong with that.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:32.480
That's not something I'm against and pro and I'm doing some of that already.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.240
But if you look at, uh, a sense of, yeah, community is an important thing,

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.540
but there should be some small force of that or some small subset of that where

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.300
in essence you're saying, no, this is in fact forced knowledge sharing.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.320
Well, I think it's important to remind you in the three of the context where

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:59.100
unity has many, many services spread out across many locations and their

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.420
different backgrounds and contexts and how they came into being.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:02.800
Right.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.460
So what I, one of my goals is to establish, I don't believe that we

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.660
should use the exact same tools, exact same processes across all services, but

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:19.520
there is a prime opportunity for growth in finding some aspects of collaboration

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.960
and consistency across those.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:29.570
So, and you and I both know, uh, that rather than me tell the team, do this,

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.170
I can highlight some good ideas of course, but one way is to motivate teams

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:38.290
to try something new is to celebrate the successes in another part of

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.590
the team five, one part of the team.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:45.910
That's really good at using monitoring to, uh, to predict, uh, customer

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.630
failure or something interesting with data.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.870
And I want to push that behavior.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.230
Right.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.950
Um, I'm going to go celebrate that.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:51.790
This is really cool.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.590
Did this little blob, maybe get the person to like write a few lines on it,

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.230
whatever, not make it over the top, but I want to have these frequent, like,

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.190
here's a really cool thing.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.850
Someone did here.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.370
Someone created a nice fake back end, nice mock framework with it.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.910
And they did, we're able to do this and this and this, or somebody

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:07.310
did blah, blah, blah.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:11.730
I want to highlight those things and highlight the things I want to see the

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.050
larger part of the org do.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.410
And so that's one method of sharing and community.

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.930
I believe that's part of community.

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:25.430
I want to, uh, I want to, there's names for this that I've forgotten at the

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.910
time, but we've all read plenty of books around how, why an anecdote, so

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.630
like why this approach works with my community metaphor is for me to

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.510
facilitate those kinds of things and why I justify, I don't need to

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:42.970
justify it, but why I feel honestly feel it's very valuable to have this

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:49.050
QA organization reporting to me where they work within team spread

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.330
across the entire company.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:51.500
Yeah.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.180
The just, just a small bit of guidance.

00:34:55.180 --> 00:35:00.580
If you hadn't thought about that, when you do that, that, that public

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:07.220
praising, right, what I would do is, uh, so make it a positive version

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.200
of Alan soapbox, whereas on AB testing, it's generally rants.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.400
This would be, uh, the yay, the cheerleading version.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.200
Absolutely.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.180
And, but let me, there's a button here, but directly tie it to published

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:31.660
principles, um, that you say are important for the next fiscal year

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.700
or things like that, that way you don't run the risk.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.660
And again, I, I'm very aware that the, the culture at Unity is likely to

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:45.160
be very different than here, but you do not want to run the risk of, of

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.730
a particular team that never gets called out, um, saying you're excluding

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:56.770
us, like you want to be able to make it very clear, like I don't give

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.570
a crap about who's doing it.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.410
I'm going to praise those who are, are clearly showing

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.070
advancements sort of the principles.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.490
And you also don't want to be accused of favoritism.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:08.030
Yeah.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:13.910
If there's one team that gets you, like they run the risk of, of them

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:18.290
being the ones that you praise most often and that the focus ends off.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.850
Oh, Alan just loves that team.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.390
Definitely keep that in mind, but that is, uh, would be much more

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.310
of a problem at Microsoft teams.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.950
Good.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.470
I mean, for me, no, but for you.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.970
Yeah.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:37.030
Um, and then the other thing that it reminds me of is, is my training was safe.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:43.190
So safe has this role called the architect and the architect is kind of, um,

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.800
sounds to me, to me, it feels very fiddle or familiar to what you're doing.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.590
So at planning events, the architect, their job is to say, Hey guys, you guys are

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.650
empowered to figure out how you do this.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:07.220
But by this date, I want all my feature teams to have converged to this

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.920
principle or this specific architecture.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:19.260
Or like an example, when I went through it, it was, um, uh, Hey, we have a new

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:27.320
Java security update, uh, by the second quarter of this year, everyone must

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.240
have moved to the latest update.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.200
Right.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:41.600
So it creates a way of where you're creating a mo, uh, motivation, a specific

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:49.060
requirement that motivates knowledge sharing, but without, you know, without

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:54.580
being a high level executive douchebag that does things like, I don't care.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.060
Everyone in Microsoft will use WTT.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:03.810
WTT for those on the acronym patrol is a, um, it's an acronym for a test

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:04.710
framework in windows.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.550
So it was called a wasting testers time.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.390
No, no, no.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.830
I'm sorry.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.970
Um, windows test technologies.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.990
No, I mean, I refer to it as WTF.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.470
Yeah.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:16.230
WTF frame.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:20.650
She's okay.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:27.530
Anyway, but I mean, so thankfully the WTT problems from my view has been resolved.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:33.570
People, people are empowered to solve their own problems.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.380
Now, what I'm rewinding a little bit.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:42.570
So what I hear you saying is not necessarily that you disagree with the

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.850
idea of the community metaphor at all, but to be careful that it's not, don't

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:53.110
frame it as a don't frame it entirely as it's part of what it is more than

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.230
that is what it is building that community is your secondary goal, not

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.950
your primary, that's, that's what I'm saying.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:59.710
I agree with that.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:09.010
It gives me a way to, I like the concept because as I mean, I am, you may have

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:13.610
you three, uh, I don't know what it's like at other companies, but these

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.290
testers are very much embedded as part of the dev team.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.610
They could, in a lot of companies, they would just report to the dev manager.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.810
I think they are better suited for their career and better suited for their

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:28.130
learning, working for me and being that expert and growing in that way.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:32.470
So I think the community is very important, but perhaps you're right.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:38.190
I should think about whether how much I stake, uh, the QA community as

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.190
what it is versus, um, other goals.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:44.070
Is community your destination or the vehicle your community

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.310
community is the vehicle.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.950
Right.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.110
So don't frame it as the destination.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.750
That's all.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:49.070
All right.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:49.750
That's all I'm saying.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.070
Yeah, whatever.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:54.510
We spent 20 minutes talking about third depends on editing.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.430
That's it.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.710
Okay.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.350
Good discussion.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.510
Good to be back.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.710
Shall we go on to, uh, number four?

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.870
Sure.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:05.910
Did we skip three?

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:06.310
That was three.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:06.590
All right.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:06.950
You ready?

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.630
Yeah.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.950
Cause I need to warm up for this.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.790
And me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.360
um, male bag.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.800
You're doing the thing at the end now.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.520
Is that a new thing?

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.120
Yeah.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.920
You're mixing it up.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.360
Mixing it up.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.400
So we have a male bag from, uh, Marcus.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.720
Marcus.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.560
Marcus.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.360
Thank you for being one of the three.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.440
And Marcus has a question about money.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.040
Yes, please.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:38.520
All right.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.180
Marcus says, would love to hear opinion and thoughts around

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.380
budget challenges and testing.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.180
It's budget season for me and my team.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.060
And in my team, it can be difficult to do what's needed, innovate,

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:56.460
change, and keep improving when restrictions on people and equipment

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.820
spend keep appearing.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.100
I've been reading essentialism and moving toward nothing less.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.940
And this fits with data driven quality.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.500
Somewhat and focusing on the essential.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.900
It's helping for sure.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.500
Any thoughts and help appreciated.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.860
So, uh, budget money, not enough.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.240
Short end of the stick, whatever it's budget.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.480
I'm sure a budget season is, or you, I actually, I know from

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.040
Microsoft budget season is when you have to somehow predict how

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.080
much money you're going to spend in the next fiscal year, which

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.360
starts on July 1st.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:30.730
Yeah.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:36.090
Something that I, my budget was so far off in just in my six

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.690
months of FY 17, whatever it was.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.830
Not my fault really at all, but it was just a mess.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:47.350
So it definitely not having to deal with budget at that level, uh,

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.430
is very much good, very much good for my blood pressure.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.910
Anyway, go ahead and give it a shot.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:54.110
Right.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.630
Oh, well, so I haven't read essentialism.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.030
Have you?

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.290
No, no.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:01.350
Okay.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.510
So let's, let's answer the other parts of the question.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:08.710
Like, well, so we, we can't be obligated to read things.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.720
No, we do that proactively.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.280
You right.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.520
Right.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:12.720
Right.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.480
So we didn't read that, but I, I get the gist of what it's about.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.360
Only the essential.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:24.310
Although I did pick up the, uh, book you suggested from Ron Jeffery.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:24.750
Oh yeah.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:25.510
What'd you think of that?

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:30.150
Oh, I mean, I've only scanned it right now, but I'm like, I like this format.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.870
It kind of reminds me of, um,

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.150
but you could have written that book.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.870
It's like all stuff I've heard Brent spew out.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.340
Yeah.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.380
This is the, uh, the nature of software development by Ron Jeffries.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:49.340
It, it, it almost, uh, just scanning through it, it, it kind of feels like, like

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.660
the, the slide deck version of Ryan Edgson's book.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:53.860
Maybe.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:54.380
Yeah.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.300
Uh, anyway.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:00.380
So, and one thing maybe missing from 57 was there were no tangents.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:03.610
Tangents are part of who we are.

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:04.730
It's our DNA.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.610
So, uh, budgets, budgets, budgets, budgets.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:16.120
So I have spent the majority of my career, although I think that's, that's

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.240
coming up to now nearly 50 50.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.080
Like I've spent a large portion of my career as a middle management.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:32.250
And, um, like my strategy to this one, this particular problem has been rather

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:38.340
effective and that is to read, uh, reverse delegate this to my manager.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.800
That, that, that works quite well for me.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:43.320
What?

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.800
So in terms of the back and depend entirely on your manager.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.160
Oh, no, it can.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.360
But well, well done.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:57.100
Um, the, the budget problems, right.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.500
You have these resource constraints.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:05.820
You have, you have, uh, these equipment constraints, right.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:11.580
And when you, the last few times that I've had to deal with this and the last

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:18.500
time was in, was when I was in Bing, which is now five years ago, um, it's

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:24.890
nice actually being in compute because there's a strong feeling that that compute

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:28.210
is the, an important future.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:34.950
So, um, we, for a good long time, we've been pretty much getting

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:40.000
everything we want, we want it on the budget.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:45.780
Like the last time I had to deal with this, it was essentially, all right.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.620
I put a number out.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.260
I can, I, I, I go, all right, if we're going to keep doing the things

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.460
that we've been doing, so if we're going to do it in the evolutionary

00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:02.780
process, then you, then it's relatively easy to say, all right, this is from

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.820
historical measures, you pull things together and you go, this is, this is

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:12.970
my prediction and you, you buffer up because, um, predictions are almost

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:19.010
always wrong and then you go through the process of renegotiating because almost

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.970
always everyone has submitted a budget.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.290
That's true with budget everywhere.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:23.050
Yeah.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:28.330
So let me, um, the one thing about me on this one though is, is I go, okay,

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.930
these are the goals I got to achieve.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:35.980
Uh, that I'm expecting to have to achieve in the next year.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:44.420
Um, these are the things where I absolutely have to have money to do that.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.480
Um, like if I know I'm going to need another, you know, couple thousand

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:55.560
machine resources, uh, to pull off the scenarios that we're sort of predicting.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:01.050
Um, then I will, I will put that in.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.450
Let me throw, throw my perspective in because it, budget covers a lot of things,

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:09.890
but as far as essentialism goes, what's that book, first break all the rules.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.050
Does the concept, the title apply something else.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:18.450
Um, one is I think machines are work machines are cheap.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.530
You just buy them.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:24.010
I think if you're looking at, uh, Microsoft traditionally just buy hardware all the

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:28.770
time versus use services like sauce labs or cobit on or any of the others, uh,

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:33.210
look into those, uh, cause you have to, when you think about budget and one way

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.570
to negotiate more budget for a license or something like that is you're not using

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.210
office space and again at Microsoft to go, well, it's a different budget,

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.410
so it doesn't matter, but it's, it's all still money.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:46.050
Like lab space in Redmond and Bellevue is very expensive.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.170
You can use that in a virtual farm, whether it's, um, Amazon, um, what do they

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.130
call it? Amazon device farms also very good.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:56.290
So that can cover a lot of your testing stuff and make it actually easier to

00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:00.850
automate and make it so you don't have to have an office or a set of offices

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.490
taken down to build a lab.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.970
There's a lot of specifics with the, what, before you go, the,

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:11.090
my final point on the budget one was essentially after you get,

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.730
go through the negotiation, right?

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:17.290
It's, it's a lot, you expect that your budget going to be shrunk.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.410
I'm not really afraid of budgets because I've over the years I've come up with,

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.330
as long as it's within a certain point, I've come up with creative solutions.

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.290
We're talking about two sides of this. There's one,

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.090
there's the whole in the budget negotiation,

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.490
which you put out something that makes sense and you get what they give you,

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:35.850
but then it's about being creative after that.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.290
That's maybe looking into device farm versus devices.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:43.420
It is looking at like one thing I've learned at Unity,

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.980
I've mentioned to you at least privately,

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.500
but that everyone working anyplace else except for Microsoft has figured out is

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.220
that everybody just has a laptop and they plug it into monitors and the keyboard

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:58.220
at work. And it's a way of not buying everybody a PC and a laptop.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.460
You can be creative and say, Hey,

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.980
we're going to try this out because it actually works in everywhere else in

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.620
the world except for Microsoft. Other things are,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:11.060
there's maybe say there's a growth of 20 heads added to your team for the

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.220
next year. You're a growing team. And of course,

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.700
the dev manager takes 16 of them and gives you four and you're going, well,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.970
shit, I'm going to need six to get what I want to get done. You're at,

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.610
you are in the advantage in this case. So let's say it's,

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.970
let's say it's 14 and six. I know I need more.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.650
It's stupid of me to ask for more unless all of mine are filled.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.170
So my strategy there is fill the damn heads quickly.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:40.210
And then what I've done successfully before in which I plan to do at unity

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.970
is show, although our ratios are much smaller is show like,

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.390
like I'm talking to the Devlin and go, Oh, this is really cool. Test idea.

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.470
I want to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's going to be awesome.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.750
He goes, that's really cool. Why aren't you doing that? Ah,

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.190
I can, I need one more head to get it done. Well, I have extra heads.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:59.550
Take one of mine. And yeah, it's,

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.230
it works because you only have six to fill and they may be a little harder

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:05.990
than filling the Dev heads. But once those are filled and you're out of

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:10.390
heads and you can show that you need more bodies to get the work done.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:12.750
That your peers sees as necessary.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:14.590
They're absolutely going to give you that head.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.150
Unless they're just a total dick wad. Uh, so you can use that. And, and,

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:22.550
but there are the challenge in budgets is not in the budgeting process.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:27.040
It's how to deal with the hand you're dealt afterwards. Well,

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.360
and when you're dealing with vendor companies, they'll always negotiate down.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.240
They want your business,

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:36.040
whether it's people for a contract resources or for, uh, services,

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.850
uh, they will always try and Microsoft though,

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:44.770
my feeling at Microsoft is they'll always try and charge you more because you

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.770
work at Microsoft and Microsoft budget managers are shitty at negotiation.

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.970
The, the other thing I'll say like it in,

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:56.410
in the typical Microsoft budget, cause you also have to,

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.260
you have to estimate your budget numbers in,

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.380
into different line items and you're not allowed to move money.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:09.180
And way, way, way, way, way in advance of actually knowing what's going to go

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:13.020
on. Yeah. So there's that prediction nature. Um,

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:17.020
like it is may now and it's late for budgeting now or probably late to answer

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:17.460
this question,

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.500
but Marcus is budgeting for the year beginning July 1st going through July 1st

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:27.460
2018. Yeah, it might be late. Uh, sorry, Marcus.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:32.330
So generally you, you get the budget in June,

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:37.570
may not be late, but it, I mean, if the due date hasn't happened yet,

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:42.360
it's soonish. Um, and so things like, um,

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:48.760
like when it comes to payroll money, I want flexibility.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:52.990
Uh, I want the ability to go,

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:57.990
I don't want to have to hire a full timer for a project that I,

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:02.030
that I know is coming and I expect to only last three months.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:05.190
Right. Right. Um, yeah,

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:09.430
but it's so hard in the work that you and I do, maybe me, especially,

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:14.110
uh, to know what I'm going to need that far in advance, like, Oh yeah. And in

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:16.470
January, I'll need someone for three months.

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:22.690
Now this is why I like my budget to be, to be, um, uh,

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:26.130
as aggregated as possible. Here's your payroll budget.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:31.370
Here's your human resource budget. Right. And so then I can say, Hey,

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.250
the full timers I need are the ones for, uh,

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:39.290
the work that I'm going to sustain. But, uh,

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.090
we're in an agile world now and it doesn't,

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:46.250
it doesn't come in as a continuous request. It's bursty.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:52.390
And I want the ability to be able to, to, uh, deal with the burst loads.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:57.200
Now I, uh, Marcus, he's in the games group, right? Um,

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:01.200
and I know they have a bursty season, but that bursty season,

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.240
I think is a bit more predictable than in, in my world.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.580
Right. Um, like, uh,

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:14.260
I have now learned when Mexico's tax season is no ideas.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:18.400
Oh, I was just talking to my employees this morning. He's doing some work. Uh,

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.320
I own also the website and every all puts all the payment systems. Yep.

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.880
And like he is, uh,

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.260
he was talking about all the tax codes everywhere that he had to learn in order

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.660
to figure out how to do this testing. I thought, holy crud.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.980
Yeah. The, for the testing, that's one thing I mean,

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:41.020
I remember back in the day when I, so for whatever reason in my career,

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:45.880
I spent a good portion testing calendaring. Um,

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.740
actually I shouldn't start because actually the coolest bugs live there.

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.100
I implemented the daylight savings time,

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.780
daylight saving time algorithm for a C E way back when the, um,

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.490
and so it's one, like one of the,

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.930
it's why I decided to be a tester instead of a developer.

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:06.050
One of the fun facts that comes up very rarely is, is, uh,

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:10.170
Hey leap day doesn't work the way most people think it works.

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:13.970
It's not every four years as an example. Well, not every four years,

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:19.550
mostly every four years with, with exceptions. Right. Outliers. Yeah.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:21.750
Most people know that. Well, smart people.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.510
You hang around with too many dummies. Um,

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:31.150
the what did Marcus ask specifically?

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:33.990
Did we just ramble on about budgets?

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.310
I think we gave him good enough answer for AB.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.780
Okay. Mainly because we're out of time. Yeah. All right.

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:49.700
It's been fun. Good to be back. I think we're recording again next week.

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:54.480
We are. Sinko did was 12.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.140
Don't say, don't say Sinko did. Don't say that's probably doesn't mean tequila.

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:04.100
No, you just said five of 12. Oh, don't say the mile. Yeah. God.

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.820
Speaking of Brent hanging around with dumb people, I'm Alan. I'm Brett.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.020
And we'll see you next time on AB testing.
