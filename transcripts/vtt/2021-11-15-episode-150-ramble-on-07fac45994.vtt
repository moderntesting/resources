00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Tell us the stats. This is episode 150 A.B. testing. Brent has stats. Tell us the stats.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:14.530
Statman Brent. Welcome to A.B. testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.010
and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.370
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hey everybody. No, I don't know. I don't know how

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.610
to be excited for this thing, but is the A.B. testing podcast. Uh, yeah, I'm Alan.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.890
I'm Brent. What do you mean you don't know how to be excited? It's episode 150.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.250
It is episode 150. Yeah. It's episode 150 of the A.B. testing podcast. It's episode 1.5.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.810
No, 150. We have done 100, only 149 for Brent, but we'll call it 150.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.810
Not counting all the one three, four, three. Yeah. We did the ABT three, four, three. We had

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.410
three of them. I think only three because only have three listeners or add a listener. So the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.970
ABT three, four, three stopped. If one of those listeners has stopped being a listener and you're

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.370
a new listener and want to do a little thing with me, you can be on a new ABT three, four, three.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.280
The one thing that would be great. Uh, so I really liked that, that series and we have a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.800
lot of the three that you haven't three, four. There's only, there's only three, three. Yeah.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.920
Well, it's no, I agree. Uh, if you're a first time listener, I'm sorry. Um,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.080
please go back to episode 87 and start from there and figure, and then you'll never make

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.560
it this far because you realize we're just two dumb guys talking, yelling into the internet.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.920
Yeah. You know, I, I just, I love our listeners. I really do. I, one aspect is.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.920
We don't deserve them, Brent. We do not deserve our listeners. I just go like, why?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.720
If you're listening to this, we still, six years later, how long we doing this?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.680
For a long time, right? You have some stats, but 150 episodes and we still don't know why you

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.320
listen. Yeah. I don't get it. Yeah. Well, we did, we did drink during one episode, you know.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.880
Yeah. That was amusing. That was your. My, my, my, my farewell at Microsoft. That was. Yeah.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.880
Low hundreds. I don't know. Maybe you know this Brent once again, though, by the way,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.160
for those of you waiting for me to yell at Brent, now's the time.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.160
Brent is eating again during the podcast because Brent's a complete,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.200
something inappropriate. He's seriously chewing on throwing these stuff into his mouth. Whatever.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.120
All right. So you've collected some stats. Tell us the stats is episode one 50 AB testing.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.200
Brent has stats. Tell us the stats stat, man, Brent.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.920
First off, it's only peanuts because I couldn't find the corn nuts this time.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.200
Yeah. I couldn't find the corn nuts or the, you know, the crunchy chips.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.870
That's great. So we're episode one 50. We've made that point. Yep. We did episode 50 in December of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:11.260
2016. And then roughly two and a half years later, we did episode 100 on, in April of 2019.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.500
Which was, I remember right really close to like our five year anniversary starting 2014. We did.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.850
We did. So 105 years came pretty close together. Yep. And we are essentially a month early

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:35.490
for episode 150, but roughly two and a half years later, we now have the, we now have this. So

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:45.330
we should hit, we should hit episode 200. Let's see magic ball. I'm going to say two and a half

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:54.690
years. That would be episode 200, April of 2024. Do you think we'll make it that long?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.480
If we want to get to episode 200. Okay. Let's go for it. Let's, let's, let's make a pledge now that

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.950
we will get to episode 200. I just can't think that far ahead. Oh, actually when, when will we hit it?

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.050
According to this around April, 2024, let me do some math.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.170
So back up, let me do some math to see. It would also be our, our 10 year.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.560
Oh, interesting. So what year is it now? 21, 22. Okay. So I have to throw, we haven't talked about

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.520
this. There's a wrench in the plan here. I haven't talked to you about Brent. There's a wrench in the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.640
plan. You're retiring next month. No, no, no, no, no. But I do want to talk about, I do want to talk

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.760
about the new job, but one thing on my bucket list. So, you know, my youngest will be done with

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:54.960
high school a year from this June. So graduating in 2023, oh shoot, this should work out perfectly

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.600
actually. So she's graduating June of 23. Is that right? No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.520
so she's a sophomore this year. No, she's a junior this year. Am I doing my math wrong? Oh, we're past

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.830
January, huh? What month is it? It's 21 now. So this year, this June will be June 22.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.470
The next June where she graduates will be June 23. I was correct the first time. Right. Thank you

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.430
for confusing me. You're welcome. So then one of the things that's been on my bucket list since

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:32.130
I've been around 10 years old has been to hike the entire Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:39.170
Canada. It takes about five months. Okay. So I would probably leave in April of 24. That's the

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.090
first year we don't have kids in the house so I can get away with it. So the plan would be to leave

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.370
right after our 200th episode if all goes well. Okay. So we'll, we'll see what we can do. Wouldn't

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.970
suck if we did one 99 and then I disappeared for five months.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.890
No, we would just do 200 the next day. Yeah. There would be no way.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.650
Or we would just skip one 99 have episode one 99 and be like a minute long and then do 200.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:16.210
Yeah. See all sorts of algorithms we, we, we just take, we just take episode 198,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.690
cut it in half and then, Oh, we should do a part two part twos. And then you'll never guess

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.410
what happened next time on the AB testing podcast. All right, man. So that that's a plan based on

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.650
stats. Yeah. You mentioned, you mentioned, so I didn't, you've never mentioned before your,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:50.420
your desire to hike that, right. So I am formally of the Boy Scouts. So I'm not in coach or I have

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:58.740
spent time doing long hikes. My kids both went through or my boys both went through Boy Scouts.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.860
My kids have done things of that nature. That sounds like a lot of, a lot of fun.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.220
Well, we've talked before about, and think about this a little bit. One is it's beautiful.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.140
Two is I like the outdoors and exercise, but more importantly, we've talked about introverts

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.660
and extroverts and extroverts get energy from being around people. And for introverts like me,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.630
doing meetings all day is tiring. Oh, think how much energy I will bank

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:36.510
walking by myself for 2,500 miles. Oh, you will until, you know, it's the last day. And then you go,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.980
Oh, I might just, I might get to the last day and I'll, I'll get to Canada and I'll just set up my

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.900
tents and say, I'm going to live here. So actually, it's being professionally homeless is really this

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.980
for, for when you were, when you were at Microsoft, did you ever take your sabbaticals?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.580
I did. I spent two and a half months in the South of France.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.820
Oh, right. I remember I didn't realize that you took your sabbatical for that. I remember your,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:11.300
the long time off. I have not taken my sabbatical yet. But a buddy of mine just finished his.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:18.800
And I was, he, he talked to me before he took, he, before he took it and he kind of took it

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.840
because he was a little, like what we've talked about in the podcast before, like sometimes you

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.080
get in a situation where you had them make a decision to either change your job or change your

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.760
job. Right. And he was at that point. He came to me before he left, because he was kind of looking

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.680
for guidance or mentorship. Like this is what I'm thinking. How should I use my time off to put my

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.160
head in the right place? So to think one of the things I said, I'm glad that you did.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.760
Because I know Microsoft HR had, has the stats, the data I showed with him,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.600
it was 20 years old at the time. But even back then, they knew that if a, if an employee took

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.720
off more than three months, the probability they come back, it was like 10%.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:09.730
Yeah. No, I, I, I anecdotally, I believe that. And I was, you know, I came back for a while,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.620
but I was, I was on my way out for the moment.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:19.660
Well, right. So one of the things in sabbaticals, and I'm curious if it was in place when you left,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:29.100
but now for sabbaticals at Microsoft, in order for you to even go, you, they will still grant it,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:35.810
but you have to commit that if you leave Microsoft, you will not leave until one year

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:42.080
after you've returned. And yeah, I believe, I believe that was the case when I took mine.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.560
Okay. Yeah. Because they, because it's apparently a good mitigation for their prior stats.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.000
And he, he came back and he is, of course, he's like, oh yeah, I completely understand why that

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.800
stat is true. Because he was like the last day, he was like, oh, I don't want to go back.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:10.320
But we had another talk anyway. So I kind of want to do a discussion here that could be

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:17.150
part things we've talked about before, part things, part things that could be ideation.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.450
Okay. I'm going to give you a term or I'm going to give you a scenario. Right. All right.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:33.100
Let's say, so we've talked about on here all the time about like the differences between on-prem

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:40.780
and services and, and how sufficiently good monitoring is equivalent to testing.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.010
I'm going to give you a term and I'm going to say, Hey, Ellen, you're going to reorg it again.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:56.940
And I'm going to reorg. And let's pretend not that I'm your boss, but I'm pretending to be your boss,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:04.220
not me. I'm like your existing boss, like someone good. Imagine that that guy's coming to you. Okay.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.540
And the thing I want you to take on all I know is three words. Okay. And I want you to

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.980
disambiguate this and design it out. And what would be the program? Okay. I want you to take

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:27.310
on customer centric monitoring. Okay. So not live site monitoring, customer centric monitoring.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.390
Is this, is this product externally facing or internally facing?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:37.020
External. So I'm selling a product that is customer centric. No, no, you're not selling it.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:45.260
You, you are going to build up the customer centric monitoring team. The only thing,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:51.890
only thing that your executive knows is he wants Alan to run this team. And he, and he's,

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:58.290
he doesn't even know who our customer is. No, you, so you have customers. Okay. Okay. But

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:06.690
so imagine you at unity. Okay. You have an executive that has, that wants you to run a

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.850
team. And the only thing he knows about this team is that you're at the head

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:17.620
and they're in charge of customer centric monitoring. So everything else is ambiguous

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.820
on purpose. Gotcha. What's the goals? What are you doing? Why are we doing this?

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:29.300
All of that is ambiguous. It's up to you because you're an exec too. In this scenario,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:35.940
what would you do? Okay. Well, I mean, the first thing I do is I do want to try and get clarity

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.580
on, and again, I know you want me to get to actually trying something, but I am going to

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:46.820
see if it's possible for me to get any clarity from anyone involved, both my new exec manager

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:52.980
and people I work with understand like what's the actual outcome you want from this? What are we,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.940
I'll play the game of, okay, let's imagine we have customer centric monitoring. What's different

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.060
about what we're doing. I'm just going to try and get somebody to give me a clue where we're

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:09.540
going. So I may not get a clear clue. Let's stop there. Like if you were to own a team called

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:19.020
customer centric monitoring and you were in charge of defining that, how would you define it?

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:25.980
So now I'm the product manager as well. Okay. Customer centric monitoring is, I would say

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.820
it's the information. I don't want to be, I don't want to be repetitive and use monitoring the name.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.940
It's the information we're able to get that let's understand our customers the best,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.780
our customers and their activities. And this is very vague. It's a fun, it's a fun little interview

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:50.510
game we're playing here, but I think customer centric monitoring. Yeah. It gives me the

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:57.230
information I can gather. Let's let's our teams know the most details about our customers as we

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.030
can, or the most beneficial details about our customers and the way we use our product as we can.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:09.070
Okay. And like for me, when I think of the term, just to help bolster, when I think of the term

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:19.440
monitoring, I think of something that feels more near real time, more, more, right? So we've

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.610
spent a good amount of time talking about like service monitoring, right? And that, right.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:34.050
Principle five, like customers define your quality, but a lot of those discussions around,

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:41.500
are around looking at, looking at customers in aggregate and saying, what are the problems

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:49.500
with our service? So for me, this term kind of takes it the other way around. So, so like imagine,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:58.140
I got to imagine how many, how many services, how many services do you help ship it in unity

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:05.660
or have done it? Like it's, it's in the dozens or plus, right? Hundreds. Okay. So unity offers

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:12.860
multiple different services. And I got to imagine unity has customers that leverage a good portion

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:19.340
of several of those services. Yep. Okay. Yep. So instead of monitoring the service,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:28.510
this is now monitoring the customer. Yeah. Again, my definition is around the customer and how they

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:36.430
use it. I wasn't monitoring health. It's who, it could be customer centric is everything from

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:42.590
demographic data around the customers and where they are, maybe even deducing their profile to

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.310
understanding how they're using the product, understanding what the experience is they're

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.830
having with the product. Where are they having success or failure, but really focusing around the

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:59.070
customer view of using the service versus the health view of the service. Well, if you think

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:05.310
of it in that regard, it would be like the customer health, right? Probably, probably a

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:12.270
business from a business point of view right now, why would you monitor? Because only customers

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.350
can evaluate the quality of the product and I monitor to understand. I want trying my best to

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:21.710
understand what the customer experience is with the product. So let me, let me take it a different

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:28.430
way. Why do you monitor to the service in general? I want to monitor it to know if it's behaving

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:35.380
within expected norms. Okay. And if it's not, you want to be able to take action. If it's not,

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.780
I want to be able to take action to correct it or to understand or to, there's something I need

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.820
to learn. Okay. Could we use that same model with customer centric monitoring? Like your

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.820
definition is, okay, are the customers behaving with the expected norms? And so what kind of,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.940
what kind of actions? I don't actually have the answers. I'm just sort of,

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.860
I, I'm really trying to explore this with you. No, no, no, I get where you're going. I,

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:06.340
yeah, you absolutely could do the same thing with customers. I want to, I guess I could have an

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:12.900
expected success rate or I want to know if customers are encountering errors. And again,

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.900
they're always going to encounter errors, but maybe I can look for anomalies in those errors

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.580
or spikes or, or maybe I want to know every error they hit when they're using my service.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.380
So I want to understand the quality of their experience. For example, I could, I could do,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:35.490
I'm looking for customers who were successful. Maybe it's just AP, successful API calls over

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:41.570
failed API calls should be at 99.9%. That would be, it's health, but it's customer facing.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.810
Right. And in that regard, it's without regard to what API is right? Because

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.570
yeah, it would depend on the service and how it's being used. But I'm,

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:56.190
I would imagine there's like, if it's a typical, uh, crud service, I would look at each of those

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:01.730
actions as well as a workflow. I fixed him to go through it would, I guess it would depend on

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:07.410
how I define success of the service or what not success of the service, what customer success

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:13.650
would look like for the service. Right. Which is going to be right. The one main reason why I don't

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:20.450
think a lot of people do this is like each customer is different. Like their workflows are different.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:26.690
Their problems are different. Yeah. Right. So this is why I actually think this is an interesting

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:33.570
topic. Like how do you, how would you define healthy unhealthy? Like I'll, I'll give you a

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:39.250
measure. I'll give you a measure that, that, that I'm thinking through. I would say if I were to go

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:45.410
back, now this is historical data. So this is no longer a monitoring scenario. This is now,

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:51.250
okay, what do we have from, from my point of view for training data, right? If I see a particular

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:57.090
set of sequences, including failure sequences, and then I see that those are correlated to people

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:05.230
leaving the platform, that probably is unhealthy. Right. Or, or if we see a particular set of

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:14.670
sequences that then go, that show suddenly growth happens, kind of implying that they were dealing

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:22.380
with something that wasn't, wasn't so much that they were willing to flip the bid, but once they

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:29.460
solved it, it, it unblocked growth. That would be another one. Sure. There's a whole bunch of stuff

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:35.700
with unique and active and returning users. You can look at, again, it depends on the platform and

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:42.340
the API and what the services and using it as a, like to me, I could see it as sort of like an

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:47.380
early warning system on a current customer basis. Like what's the probability that,

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.220
what's the probability that a whale customer, I got to imagine Unity has whale customers. I don't

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.540
know if you use that language, right? Yep. That's, that's, I think that's basically industry standard.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.460
Okay. One of my fame, favorite game producers, and I think one of yours as well, Bethesda,

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:11.420
are they on Unity? No, that's sad. But I got to imagine if they were, they would,

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.660
they would likely be viewed as a whale, maybe. Okay. Okay. So they're not,

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:24.560
so let's use them hypothetically. How would you know if their experience might be unhealthy and,

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:32.160
and unhealthy in a way, for example, how far away might this company be from, from abandoning the

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.480
platform? I think it depends on the service in some cases for calling your CEO and saying WTF.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.360
Well, the, the best example is to look at, uh, like for some of our whales, we will count,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.120
we will monitor, set up monitoring and alerts for their revenue stream. So we can see money coming

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.080
in for them, like through an ads platform. You could also do the same thing through other APIs

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.240
as they're using them understand specifically if their success rate is going down. Right.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.800
Cause once you see, once you see an anomaly in the revenue stream, then you want to be able to

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:12.670
look for the causation. Right. Right. Anything else that you can think about in this front

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:19.470
to me, I think it's a, it's an interesting idea. If we look at it in an entirely different way

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:26.780
and treat each customer individually. Now, that of course constructs a problem on scale,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.980
right? You have to figure out, okay, well, what are the actions that you would take?

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:36.780
Well, I think what you could do is you could take your whale customers and maybe build models

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.140
based on what you discovered and monitor with them and see if you could apply those at the

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:47.580
smaller scale of the smaller customers. Maybe I do feel like lean analytics though,

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.380
which I think you've read does cover a chunk of this. They don't call it customer focused

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:58.060
analytics or whatever customer centric analytics, but they are looking at analytics based on the

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.820
lean startup or MVPs or iterations, which I think does, there's an overlap.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.460
There's an overlap, but a lot of those things are doing it from a, again,

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:15.840
some a service sort of view or a product sort of view. It's the thing that's an interesting pivot

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:22.000
to me is instead of, or in addition to, not instead of, but in addition to monitoring

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.450
and doing all the data feeds that we've been talking about around the product itself

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.800
and aggregate, how does it change if you take that same set of data, but pivot by customer

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.440
and what actions would you change? Like here's, here's, for example, one of the things,

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.640
I'm not blowing any, any NDA thing. Cause I think this would be a common situation.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:55.360
So I spent a lot of time in look at, you know, on a day-to-day basis, looking through our support

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:03.840
data, constantly finding insights for things around how we can improve. And my team has also spent

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.640
a good amount of time doing what's sort of the user journey or the retention funnel.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:17.920
And one of the things that we, we eventually did is we broke our customers

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.570
into multiple categories and then only started looking at two of them. So we, we found two

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:32.050
different personas and we split them into, I think there's what seven, eight different categories,

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:39.920
but then we only look at two and those, those two are what we'll say. I'll give them the names

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:48.000
of the whales and the startups. Okay. You couldn't think of a cool animal name for the startups.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:57.120
The whales and the, the, the tigers. I immediately think of tigers because of Kaizen.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.160
What? Okay. But not puppies. Okay. That's fine. You can go tigers.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.240
Yeah. And for the weasels, how about that?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.320
Ink, penguin weasels.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.120
Some of them. Yes. Yeah, for sure. Cool.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:14.800
Now, the reason why these are interesting is the whales, these two categories,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.610
they show fundamentally different behavior. The, the whales are number one, where we get

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:28.130
the majority of our revenue. Not surprising. That's kind of the definition of a whale,

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:37.870
but generally they care less about the efficiency of their money. Like money is not a problem for them.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:43.070
Generally, they just view it as, okay, it's a cost. How I want a different goal. Like I

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:50.430
want availability or I want stability or, you know, some other illity. The other guys, again, the,

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:56.430
the, the weasels we'll call them. I don't like calling them weasels. I'll go back to tigers.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:05.550
The tigers, the thing about them is they're very cost conscious. They need to be lean, right? If

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:11.630
you've, as you and I have both done, we've read lean startup and the purpose of a startup is to

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:19.170
find a stable business plan before the money runs out. Right? Yep. But these guys, they're very

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:28.880
cost conscious. ROI is super important to them, but they have the benefit that there is orders,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:38.030
not just one, but orders magnitude higher. So if you think about decision-maker, there's a lot more

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:49.470
humans making decisions in the, the tire category. And so analyzing these, these two sets differently,

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:56.670
I found to be extremely interesting because it, and actually one of the things that's interesting

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:02.430
is we're finding, so a lot of executives top down there, they go, okay, if we can make our whales

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:09.150
happy, then everyone else benefits. No, that's not true. It's not true. I've actually found it's the

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:15.390
other way around. Yeah. Yeah. They're special. Right. I found that it's exactly the other way

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:20.990
around because making the whales happy, what they want is all their little specific, very proprietary

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:28.830
things that, that no one else cares about in terms of thinking that bit from, from that angle,

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:40.190
then to me, customer centric monitoring might be across our entire fleet of products. Can we identify

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:47.790
key places where it is clear from customer behavior that they're making decision points

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:57.410
and whether or not those decision points are mutually beneficial, detrimental to the business?

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:03.890
Did I lose you there? Nope. You got me. All right. Okay. Well, I kind of

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.330
talked through this. I'm not certain which else to go to.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:13.010
All right. Yeah. So is this your new business venture?

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.540
Prince customer centric monitoring? No. So this was a term that was introduced to me today.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:30.220
Unfortunately, it was presented as essentially yet another, it was presented to me as essentially

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:38.300
a synonym for yet another preventative test suite that somebody wants to run. And I'm like,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:46.990
okay, the name is cool. And I think, you know, being in the year 2021, we can do a lot cooler

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:54.910
stuff than, then, then try to revisit, you know, 1986 tech. Cool. You can call it Project Tiger.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.560
Project Tiger.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:03.100
Project Tiger. Yeah, sure. All right. Okay.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.660
Exciting.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.300
A brainstorming lesson on principle number five. You know what? In my notes somewhere,

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:18.220
speaking of principles, I did write up the revised modern quality principles. I don't know what to call

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.300
them. Are they still modern testing principles? The ones that we remember a couple episodes ago,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.740
we talked about them. We talked about generalizing. I didn't. And my guys, I think the modern testing

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:33.420
principles are still true. We're now just like, no, no, no, no. But I don't know if I've generalized

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.420
them. Are they still called modern modern testing principles? That's my question. Anyway,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:43.340
I got to post those to one of the three.slack.com. You get your innovation at moderntesting.org.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:50.940
My biggest, one of my biggest accomplishments, I have two maybe huge accomplishments in 2021,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:57.340
maybe three. One is still being alive during the pandemic. Number two is I managed to get

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:03.980
an auto renewing SSL certificate on moderntesting.org. Okay.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.220
For those of you who don't know, moderntesting.org used just to be a Google domain that I had

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:16.860
auto redirect to the old blog site before we moved to Anchor. But this year I moved it to AWS

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:24.210
where I pay a whopping like $1.12 a month for hosting moderntesting.org. It's rough, but

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:31.650
I was also able to get it set up with a Let's Encrypt certificate that auto renews files.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:36.290
Took me a couple tries to get that right, but that's my second biggest accomplishment of 2021.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:42.370
And I have a third, which I told you about a couple of weeks ago that I'll let the listeners

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:48.610
know, which is maybe about a year ago, I announced on this podcast that for the first time in forever,

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.420
first time in like maybe, because I was at one of those levels of Microsoft where you have to,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:02.500
there's lots of inappropriate ways to put this, you have to suck up a little bit to get another

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.380
promotion. And I refuse to do it. I was at one of those career levels. So about a year ago,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.220
I got promoted for the first time in a long time. That was,

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:16.980
I don't, that is not a career level thing. That is a divisional cultural thing.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:24.900
Whatever. I, yeah, again, I, uh, anyway, I got promoted again. And, uh, my new, did I tell you

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:30.100
about my, do we talk about my new group on before on the podcast? I think I can't remember with the

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:36.180
new reorg a group called engineering services, which is all of the tools, it's tools and

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.660
infrastructures, essential tools and infrastructure for all of unity desktop apps, as well as cloud

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:48.340
apps documentation org is also in my org. So have an org now about 200 people. And I am the new

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:54.900
VP of engineering services. Hey, Kamala and I have something in common or both VPs.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.100
I think my boss may be slightly more confident than hers.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:08.610
Uh, yeah. And, and I think you're slightly more competent than, um, anyways. Um, yeah.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:14.370
We could, we could go there and, and to be clear, to be clear, I am, for those of you may be

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:22.130
listening for the first time, I am no conservative Trump lover. I just expect more from a, I'm also

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:27.170
not afraid to call out when I expect more from someone in charge. So that's all going to leave

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:32.450
that right there. Go on through topic. So anyway, what does that mean? Nothing. My job's the same

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:37.330
right now. I have, I have, honestly, I have too many direct reports right now and too much

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.730
learn about the org to do what my role should be, which is a lot more outreach across the company

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:48.930
and getting people to do, to understand what we're there for. Although I'm doing a little

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:54.450
outreach next week, I am meeting with, uh, one of the folks from Weta. Did you know,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:32:00.660
you know, what are, did you hear about the Weta acquisition? Weta is a company owned, uh,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:09.620
presently by Peter Jackson. It's all the software used for digital effects and 3d rendering used in

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:15.300
avatar, all of the Lord of the rings movies, uh, game of thrones, all that stuff. Uh,

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:20.580
unit unity bought there, not the film studio part, but they bought the software engineering

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:26.180
tools, the graphical tools with their customer remaining, uh, primarily, uh, Peter Jackson

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:32.740
studios. Uh, we have, yeah, pretty, you know, state of the art, sophisticated graphic and

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.500
artistry tools, which are now part of unity is pretty cool. And I'm going to meet with one of

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.060
the folks from there next week. I'm excited about that. Cool. So is, is you welcome them to

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:47.300
the show is unity going to like, uh, start going into the movie business, taking on Pixar.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.700
It's like game. It's like games. We don't make games that we give you a game engine to do it.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.620
We're not going to make movies. We're going to give you the tools you need or more. We give you

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.940
some already more of the tools you need to make movies. Like we already have a major

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.180
with this acquisition and just acquiring the tools. We already have a major film company

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.020
using our stuff and we'll have more over time. What this does is by taking it,

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.820
it does two things. It gets Peter Jackson out of the software business and it gives more,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:21.460
more other companies ability to, uh, purchase and use those tools for their digital effects.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.220
So it's, it's pretty exciting. And then of course, some of the, a lot of this stuff will

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.740
make it into game development as well. All cool stuff, but I'm going to meet with them.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:35.060
And to do that, I may actually go to the unity office for the first time in a very, very,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:40.180
very, very, very long time. Oh, and, and, oh, oh, and because we haven't played in a long time.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:47.780
We talked about it before in the game of where in the world is Alan, I may go to Copenhagen in

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:54.290
December. Nice. You're going to be back pretty well with COVID. I'll be back by Christmas,

00:33:54.290 --> 00:34:01.730
barring any, you know, lockdowns or anything. But with one caveat, I was getting ready to go

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:07.490
and I went and dusted off my passport, which I haven't looked at him forever. And it expires

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:13.090
within three months, which is way too little time for them to let me actually go. So I sent in for

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:18.210
an expedited passport and we're going to see how quickly it comes back. So I may push that out till

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:23.490
January. I feel like in June when we're all getting vaccinated, we saw like a light at the

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:27.730
end of the tunnel, like, man, it's going to get better. Then there was a Delta variant and a

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:33.410
bunch of people who still think that the vaccine is going to mutate their DNA and turn them into

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:40.530
zombies within 18 months. And yeah, we're in a weird spot. I don't think that's actually what

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:47.650
they think. Yes, that's what they think. Okay. All right. You don't want me up on that soapbox.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:53.810
I don't think that's what they think. Yeah, they do. They do. No, but I have a more interesting

00:34:53.810 --> 00:35:00.690
question because I don't know. Ask away. I don't know what it was that you just said that triggered

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:06.530
me, but it reminded me of a discussion I've had recently. So in your view,

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:15.340
what is the best game of all time? Well, that's an interesting question and a subjective question

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:22.350
where you could argue almost any answer. So it depends. Tetris. You know, it could be Tetris.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:30.110
The game, okay, the game I have probably put the most hours into ever is Skyrim. Is it the best

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:36.670
game? Yeah, pretty good game. Top 10. Yeah, for sure. I really am a fan of sort of the

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:42.430
Metroidvania genre. So especially the, and again, not the best games, but again,

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:49.710
quality can only be evaluated by the customer and like the Ori games, Ori and the Will-O-Wisps,

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:54.910
Ori and the Blind Forest, two of my favorite games ever. Those are games I can play over and over

00:35:54.910 --> 00:36:00.510
from beginning to end. Best game ever. For me, it's not going to be a shooter because I suck at them.

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:08.910
It's not going to be an MMORPG. I think what Blizzard developed World of Warcraft is fantastic

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:13.950
in getting people addicted to their game like it's crack cocaine. But while I have put hours

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:18.750
into that game and played it a couple of times through, I generally get bored with all the

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:24.110
toxic behavior from the people in the end game. So that takes away from me. The whole point of

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:28.270
the game is to get to the end game and do all the big raids and stuff, but the people doing

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:34.030
that stuff are just jerks. So by the time I get there, I'm doing it. I completely, I am not a fan

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:46.860
of the MMORPG period, but I will say both Starcraft and Warcraft are in my top five and probably

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.540
multiple times. And to be fair, a similar engine. In fact, Bethesda made both, right?

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:58.220
Fallout four was one of my favorites. Oh, so that actually you've now mentioned

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:05.420
the two things that he and I debated, right? Because he came in and he just straight up said

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:10.140
Skyrim is the best game ever. And I'm well, that's funny. Yeah, it was. That's one of the

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.740
first ones I brought up. Yeah, this is what the one you said you spent the most time on.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:20.220
But I'm like, that is clearly fault. Like, and I said, any, any in my view, any of the Fallout

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:26.980
series from Bethesda is better than Skyrim. Now Skyrim's fantastic. Sorry.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.220
Are you including Fallout 17?

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:38.100
Because I just made the same mistake I made with that as an exception.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:48.960
Now I have not played 76 in several years. Right. And I understand that they may have

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:56.160
unscrewed it. All right. Whatever. Anyway, I, I never, I yeah, same. Um, that's a good one. I think

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:08.830
I'm trying to remember if I ever actually finished Fallout. Any of them? No, I think I may. I try to

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:14.530
remember if I finished the end of Fallout because you can finish and keep on playing. You're talking

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:21.090
about Fallout four. I thought four. Yeah. Yeah. I finished the end of that and every single

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:28.290
DLC that they had. Doesn't that one and go. No, I do remember the end now. Yeah. Because you go to,

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:33.250
I'm getting a bunch of games in my head kind of merged together in the weird endings.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.290
But yeah, I can't remember now. I think follow what I get.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:42.450
Fallout four is the one where you, I think you have to go kill people at MIT.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:48.130
Yeah. Yeah. You're in Boston the whole time killing people. Yeah. So that, that, so the answer was,

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:52.530
it's interesting that you asked two people and they both said Skyrim, but then

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:59.330
Skyrim was the best. You said that you're right. I didn't. Now if we, and to be fair,

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:05.410
and here's the funny part, I never finished Skyrim either. I am class. I will play 90%

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:11.730
of the game. And for some reason stop sometimes because it gets hard sometimes because I'm just

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:15.410
bored at the end. Oh, I finished Skyrim, but I've never played it again.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:22.850
There's some very few games like mass effect. Mass Effect is, is one of the few RPT,

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.770
PG type games that I've actually gone back and played as a different character.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:32.530
Yeah. I actually don't like the, I get tired of the gameplay and mass effect of all like that

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.450
choosing what you're going to say to somebody, I guess he had to do that in fallout and it's

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:42.050
all the same. So nevermind. Cool. And then what was the other one borderlands is fun.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:48.690
Oh, again, another game I love to play, but haven't finished every single one ever. I have played,

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:54.450
I didn't play two. I played three, four, that one that kind of came in the middle in space.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:40:01.970
And every single one I get 75, I get 75% of the 80% done. I get to a boss that I just can't kill.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:06.210
I try 40 or 50 times and I give up and the game stays there. Sometimes I'll go,

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:12.690
I'll get bored and I'll pick a couple hours trying to go kill stuff in easier areas to level up a

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.690
little bit and get stronger so I can kill the boss. But I still can't get to it. I just give up.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:26.210
I'm not good enough to like, I absolutely love the first four, six, 10 hours of gameplay,

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:30.850
the borderlands games, and then I'm just stuck and I have to give up. It's frustrating.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.850
But the problem is borderlands five will come out and I'll buy it onto the same thing.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.770
It's worth it to me to pay the 60 bucks for that 10 hours a game.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:46.130
But our lands four is the only one I haven't solved. And that was mostly because me and my

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:53.650
younger son were playing it together and then COVID happened and then he, he did college and

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:59.890
now it's like in this incomplete thing and I refuse to start playing it by myself.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:04.930
So that one may, may never get finished. I don't know. I have an Xbox game pass

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.980
and it was, she means I download a lot of games and I play a lot of them for about 10 minutes

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:14.060
and delete them. I have a hard time finding games I like. I really liked, and this is,

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.380
this is going to be controversial because not a lot of people did, but for whatever reasons,

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:25.340
the gameplay and puzzle solving of the Tomb Raider series out of Ubisoft, I believe Square

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:30.140
Enix. I've liked a lot. Those are, those are games I'll always purchase and play through

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:34.060
and often buy a chunk of the DLC. Yeah. I was just thinking through

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:41.020
the Assassin's Creed series. I played all of those. I tried. I tried. I could not get into this.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.900
I've, I've played a half hour or an hour of maybe four. I've gotten,

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:53.660
so the later ones, actually, there was one where the main character is a ship captain.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:02.940
He is actually fighting the Assassins and that was kind of the last one I did. Deus Ex.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:10.180
That was, that's actually one, that's the only one I can think of when you were talking through

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:15.300
games where you get to a boss fight. It's really nothing you can do except start the game over and

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:25.100
rebuild. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. It's so Deus Ex. Have you played Deus Ex? No. Okay. It's, it's one of these

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:31.890
things where you go along and then you get, so the main character is sort of a cyborg and you can get

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:40.880
upgrades to particular systems. And with this one main boss, I was, it was absolutely clear that

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:47.500
the way I upgraded is not going to help me win. And there was no like place, like a lot of games

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:54.800
you can go redo your build. Yeah. There's, there's no, there's none of that in this game. So I call

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:02.670
that a bug. I did too. Cause I'm just like, okay, I can just keep pounding my head against this,

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:08.860
you know, titanium wall, or I could start all over and I'm like, all right. None of those

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:14.620
options sound interesting to me. At least one of our three listeners doesn't game and is completely

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:20.780
bored by now. Oh, okay. So let's go to the last game. So the one is fitting that there are two

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:26.300
that has taken up all this story was going somewhere. This is new information. Now, the,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:35.180
the two is taking up the most time right now is, uh, back into magic cards, but now on the app.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:41.260
So magic, the gathering arena. I'm all about that. Uh, and then, uh, animal crossing.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:52.400
So, uh, I have not, uh, jumped into the animal crossing bandwagon, but there is an active animal

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.440
crossing community at unity. They have a channel where they communicate a spreadsheet where they

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.960
keep track of what their things are so they can trade and what they make, et cetera.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:09.040
Uh, you know, last year there was a DevOps conference held inside of animal crossing.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:15.520
I did not know that. Uh, I'll see if I can dig out a link to that. Someone will. So yeah,

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:21.200
it is a thing I've never gotten into. I, my daughter played quite a bit. I thought about getting a,

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:27.280
um, switch, a, uh, switch so I could, you know, join the club and make stuff, but I did not.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.840
I still want to get a switch just to play Mario Kart, but whole different genre of game.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:37.280
But I think, I think Mario Kart's a fantastic game. It is a great game. I'm looking at it.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:49.180
So yeah, it was April, 2020 DevOps conference. That's awesome. All right. Yeah. Maybe that's

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:55.260
where we should have modern test con is in animal crossing. I'd be aboard, although there's no

00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:01.260
audio for the things. So you can only chat. So I think that would get tiresome pretty quickly is

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.980
yeah. I'd have to look and see how they did that, but we'll figure it out. All right, man.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:11.580
Any other announcements or I mean, this was like the rambling one 50 of, of stuff.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:18.700
No, I have its review season. We got, I did there. I'll do next week. I'm taking Thanksgiving week

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:26.140
off. It's a Friday. So I'm going into the weekend to recharge because I have a crap ton of, of

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.420
connects to write the following week. Cause they're all due by the end of the week.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:36.140
Uh, then I have another week. Oh, I guess for me, this exciting is my, my eldest will be home

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.140
for Thanksgiving. So that's fantastic. All right. Yep. That's it. We should.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.700
Okay. Well, we kind of, kind of a rambling one 50, but a little bit of time with Brent and

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.260
Allen, you see what's new with us and we'll come back in a couple of weeks with one 51.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:54.060
I guess we're going to have to drink Bacardi one 51 during the episode, because how could you not

00:45:55.060 --> 00:46:00.420
and Brad says, no, do we want to, I actually, you know what? I don't like rum at all. I may have

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:06.180
drank too much of it when I was like 17, but I don't like rum. Rum is rum is great, but right now

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:16.500
I've actually gotten into, uh, it's called Roku. It's it's, oh yeah. That's it. Like TV. No, it

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:24.020
videos. It's a Japanese gin and it's interesting. Awesome. Rice gin. No, I think these several of

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:30.180
the same ingredients, but they add a Japanese style like Yuzu. Do you know what Yuzu is? Yuzu?

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:36.580
Okay. They add Yuzu to, to it. And so it has, it has these delightful citrus overtones.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.580
Next time on food and wine with Brent and Allen. All right, dude. All right, man. Let's call it

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:48.820
good. This has been episode one 50 still episode one 50. I'm still Alan and I'm Brent. All right.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.700
See you later.
