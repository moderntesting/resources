WEBVTT

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.960
Good morning everybody. Hello. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm brain. That's AV testing time again. What number are we rent? 37?

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.980
Happy 37 we should have met. Yeah, I wish it was a happy 37. You're not happy. I am happy

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980
It's just happy 46. Oh

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.100
Okay, you're younger than I am. So, you know what else I'm happy about what are you happy about?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.940
I'm happy that the three still listen and the three are on Twitter and while we were talking here

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.620
I saw that Percy just Percy Percy tweeted us. Hey Percy. How's it going?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.770
Yep, they didn't have it. I wonder if he listening in the car if he actually answered says hey, how's it going?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.060
So Percy he had a question not a not a mailbag question just a hey guys question

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.980
All right, then he said any chance we will see a one of the three slack chat room

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.970
I can create one but want to see if you two are okay with it. Oh any chance. So it's a data science question

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060
Oh

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.500
Well, let's let's draw some diagrams on the board

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
This

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
The universe of

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.660
Possibilities here might take up the whole podcast and since it's a podcast on a video cast. Maybe we should address it a different way

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.080
Anyway, what's this question? I just read you his question. Yeah, I was busily trying to be funny

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280
No

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.660
Any chance that we'll have you a

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.580
Slack chat room. Well, it says but he says I can create one I being Percy

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.660
But which means there's a good chance there can be a slack chat room a very good chance. Yes pending his skills

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.920
He doesn't say I will create one or I am

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.780
This is a can I'm gonna guess that's a high probability

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.420
It seems like it it also seems like unlike me. It seems like he has high confidence in his ability to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.020
Create one whereas to my knowledge

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.780
I have never either explicitly or accidentally gone to the slack website. So I don't I use slack

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.740
So I'm gonna reply. Okay, perzy fine with us as long as we don't have to commit to anything

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.320
Hashtag live on a B testing. There you go

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.890
Okay, if I do how to send the tweet, there we go. The tweet is out to the world

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.490
we have our typical agenda on the whiteboard this time in supplied entirely by Brent and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.690
Bum bum bum and if it's possible even less prep than

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.410
Normal, so Brent has has all kinds of ideas and primped at a notepad

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.910
Primped prep. It's like primping and prepping at the same time. Brett has primped looks great today

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.130
has a little bit of the mad scientist here going on, but he also has a notepad full of stuff and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.050
Take it away Brent. Yes, so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.870
Today I would say the the theme for the podcast is what yes all about one of our

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.590
Listeners one of the three

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.730
Patrick prill also on Twitter as test Pappy. All right. Are we he's a nice guy. You're not gonna make fun of him

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.100
Are you we might I mean this

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.770
Sorry, I

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.770
Asked you for the chance on that one. No

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.210
Shut up with your math

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.850
So very recently

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.210
Feels like it was about a month ago

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.100
I have no concept of the passing of time. But yeah, it sounds great. Oh

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
Pratik did a presentation at

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.040
Did you call him Patrick? I might have okay. He's just already starting making fun of him

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.720
It's it's combining his first and last names together. All right, whatever. Yeah Patrick did a presentation

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.600
That's posted up on the mint. So there's a test ministry of testing the dojo of yeah, just bash

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.780
Yeah, what's the name of the website a ministry of testing? Yes that one

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.440
And we get calm we got we were made aware of it from another listener Vernon who?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.720
Pointed out that Patrick did a shout out. So thanks for the shout out Patrick

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.460
So I watched the whole presentation and I think I think you would I know I know Alan hasn't watched it yet

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.490
Sorry Patrick, it's it's on my list though. But I think the presentation was was a very interesting theme and it was

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.630
essentially on the theme of

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.380
Testers using

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:14.210
Ignorance as a tool that ignorance is actually critical in the knowledge working arena

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.540
The it's just similar to ignorance in the way Philip armor talks about ignorance as a it is

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.460
knowledge acquisition for actually there was so there was there was

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.020
it's funny that you brought that up because

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.040
so

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120
He presented the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.320
W pyramid that we've talked about on the the podcast and that's actually where he shouted out

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.450
We talked about that we did. All right. I'll trust you

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.030
Both me and Patrick said we did and your old and forget

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.730
And he called out he he attributed

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.640
The

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:08.640
What we classified or attribute to Philip or more he attributed to Donald Rumsfeld because Rumsfeld has a similar quote and

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.040
That actually bugged me so much. I went and looked up the dates

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.840
Amour came out with with with his orders of ignorance and ACM in

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.100
2000 and

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.220
Rumsfeld came up with his the unknown known speech

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.140
At a press conference in February 2002 so Amour wins boom, isn't it armor?

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.860
I don't know. I thought he has a you in it. So I'm more Philip are more. Yes

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.860
Yeah, five four five orders of ignorance win Rumsfeld a copycat

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.930
both of them

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.850
So that

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.090
For those who care go look up Rumsfeld and Wikipedia

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.930
But let me just recap just but it's actually older way older than both of these guys account

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.170
What's attributed is to a poem called heaven and earth or something along those so let me

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.070
Let me just interject go and because that's what we do on a be testing

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.770
So for those of the three that just tuning in for the first time and are going

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.530
WTF are they talking about?

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.890
The five orders of ignorance Philip armor and ACM paper talked about the five orders as a

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.330
Knowledge acquisition framework and starts off with you know what you know, I know how to speak English

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.550
despite the

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.910
the thoughts of many a be testing listeners I

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.430
Know I I know I don't know how to speak Chinese

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.830
But I do know I do know of many ways that I could discover

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.870
How to learn that I could I could take classes online

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.510
I could you know, I could go to a class I could move to China and immerse myself there multiple ways

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:52.710
I know how to learn that I know it's I know that I don't know it and then I don't know what I don't know and

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.120
I have no there I cannot by definition give you an example of that

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.880
But that's how we learn and discover and then the next level up is really important

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.880
It's I don't have a suitable means to discover what I don't know

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.720
I don't know meaning that could be community that could be the internet

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.880
But you have to have some methods for discovering those things that you don't know

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.840
You don't know and when knowledge acquisition works is that you you have those means to discover what you don't know

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.760
You don't know by by learning that it becomes something

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.520
You know you don't know and you can choose to pick out something you know by studying or reading or learning about it

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.360
So that's how knowledge is acquired and the fifth order of course is that you don't know the five orders of ignorance

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.160
Because you'd say that so you don't even understand how knowledge acquisition works

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.950
And interlude over that's actually the the best interpretation of the fifth order that I've ever heard

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.350
I

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.950
Love I Philip armor was here right now

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.470
I would hug him because I but the fifth order always bugged me

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.110
You could see it is very tongue-in-cheek. Yeah, I just sort of

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:02.790
Hey, and the fifth thought the one way to interpret is and you don't know how awesome this list is

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.750
It's really multi-layered. It's very tongue-in-cheek and can be kind of funny at first class, but it's really about

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.790
Under like I know how knowledge acquisition works

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:17.110
I get how all this works and so now I can learn and grow and have the growth mindset blah blah blah

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:23.230
So actually one of the things that given your interpretation of the fifth order

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:29.150
It very well connects to sort of the theme that Patrick had for his whole deck

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.950
He's basically calling out

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.560
Hey, there's a lot of testers that I'm aware of he doesn't call it out

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.600
He's very polite and diplomatic and funny

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.740
But when you break through that cross he's basically essentially calling out

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:54.300
That there's a lot of testers who are in the fifth order that they didn't get it. They don't get it. It's essentially

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:01.620
Whereas he he is making a statement of as soon as he

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.220
Started to think about things

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.150
Instead of just doing he realized how much knowledge he was lacking

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:17.900
Ma'am he even has a great slide where it says the the right the more you learn

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:25.540
Then the the wider the surface area of those things that you know, you don't know become

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.820
So the more you learn the more you know what you don't know

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.140
Yeah, I yes, I think I told this story before how when I first

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.740
I had been a tester for about five years. I was kind of I think I was in

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.640
In that world. I've been a tester for three four years, maybe maybe five

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.600
They're probably a little less than that and I decided you know what? I like this. I want to learn more about this

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600
So I read a book about testing. I forget which one

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.040
I forget which one I read first and I read and I thought well, okay now I know everything about testing

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.240
This is awesome. So I got it figured out

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.440
But then I read another book and then I saw both parallel

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.000
I saw both parallels contradictions new ideas and I thought well

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.830
Okay, this is pretty good now. I know a lot about testing

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:16.430
This is I have other I so now I'm more educated and then I read a third book and it was after the third book

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.430
I realized I didn't know crap about testing

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:24.320
Because I just the the combination of the three sort of open the world to me said wow

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:30.140
This whole thing is it's a little bit of the iceberg below the water thing. It's this is but but bigger

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.300
It's as much bigger than I thought it was

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.630
Yeah, I know and it's interesting right because poor Patrick. Thanks for gonna talk about him

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.030
It's it's an inspired by Patrick, I'm sure he'll accept that

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.470
Now I have a similar story

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.950
Right. I think I'll

00:11:54.670 --> 00:12:02.280
Leave out I know what was my first book and I'm gonna leave out both the book and the author

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.960
to protect the innocent because

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:13.820
I then later on when I first got my first management gig. I would always order this book

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.380
For any of my new hires and I would say okay in two weeks

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.700
I want you to have read this book and we're gonna have a one-on-one. Okay, and

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.560
They would read the book and they would come back much like how you expressed it

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.700
Awesome

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.980
Now I know everything about testing right and just for the record

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:41.140
This was not how we test software at Microsoft. So just he's not protecting me, right? No

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.740
Your book just just for the three your board your book

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:54.460
Even a glimmer in your eye. I just I just wanted to be clear. I was not aware with the AB testing timeline

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.270
So they would come back two weeks later and they go oh man that book was awesome

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.310
I know everything about testing. I'm wearing to go

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.230
and then I would say

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.480
great

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.120
now I

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:16.810
Want you to reread the book and in two weeks? I want you to come back to me and tell me

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:24.940
Every place where the book is wrong. So great. You're a test. You're you know everything about testing

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.660
Test this book and

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.900
It occurs to me base even based off of Patrick's theme, right?

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.970
one of the things and

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.490
They would come back and they go

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:44.550
This doesn't seem like it's right and this doesn't seem like it's right and this doesn't seem like it's right and I was

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.690
super

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.610
happy with the result

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:55.430
but it occurs to me now freaking 20 years later that a big possibility is because I

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.310
Accidentally created a process where my testers instead of just being

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.990
Formulae monkeys that go through what everyone's supposed to do

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:11.190
I started them off on the path of critical thinking. So yeah, I was gonna say instead of having them read this big thick book on

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:16.790
testing software twice, how about having read one thin book on

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.310
Critical thinking just cut just cut to the chase there bread

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.220
Because I think

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:32.940
Critical thinking for much of these guys are new kids out of school is to still too much of an aspect

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.400
I I believe you're right. I thought about this and I've

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:43.100
Yeah, I thought even in those two seconds and and you're right you can I think critical thinking is a difficult thing

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:49.780
It's you the books on the subject are helpful and interesting if you understand what critical thinking is

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.700
But as an introduction you need some sort of hands-on

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.780
In my experience a little bit of hands-on to

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.220
Get the concepts even then like even my exercise, right? It's still kind of theoretical

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:09.220
Yeah, right, but it's I don't know applied theoretical. All right, we're going somewhere with us. All right, it's okay

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.120
We're only 15 minutes in

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:19.480
The fact we got past the intro by now is a miracle. Hey, yeah, we're way ahead of our latest patterns

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.600
All

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.600
right now but

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.170
There was another slide on

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.850
on Patrick's deck

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.000
that I'm

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.660
Setting up as sort of the theme for the rest of our conversation today and

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.550
So again, the theme of the whole deck was ignorance and knowledge and he got to this one slide

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.740
Where he lists off

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.740
about five or six different questions I

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.120
Have

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.120
copied those questions

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.000
Here and then I've added them and I've reordered them

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.760
And the reason why I've done that is because as he was going through the slide

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.280
He was expressing things that we've talked about

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.440
numerous numerous times

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.660
Where language is important

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.660
having a common

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.140
Taxonomy with a team is important. Right we've talked about the curse of

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.450
overloaded terminology

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.890
But then he stated he didn't know what any of these things

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.640
were

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.850
which

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:40.690
Leads the which led it sort of his audience participants to view it as

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.490
These are sort of philosophical questions and some of those things I looked at him like

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.620
No, I don't I don't I don't agree I don't think these are entirely

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.700
Philosophical although several of the ones we have taken on the podcast philosophical approach

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.740
But I'm like, I think we can do better than that. I think we can add precision

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.380
I think we can can look at it from a scientific point of view

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.980
All right. So you're saying just make sure I understand where you're coming from because sorry again Patrick. I haven't viewed the video

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.260
but in the in the concept of

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.880
Learning what you don't know. You don't know he's looked he's looked at like some number of

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.680
Terms from the software and software testing world and said when I really think about it

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.550
Although I used I may even use these words or phrases. I don't know what they really mean

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.390
Soup the nuts great. Okay, so I

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:43.850
Think based on on what I've just done. I want to do two things number one. I'll ask you a question

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:49.690
And then I'd like to hear your opinion on can this only be approached from

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:56.290
Say a philosophical point of view or can we do better and if we can do better

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.050
What would be your best definition?

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.130
and then in here the

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:12.730
As if we if we what's the opposite of abstract specific if the more specific we can get I think the better

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.360
The answer is alright. Anyway, so I've reordered his his

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.520
Questions because I think there's a lot to me. I think there's a logical order

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.900
But the very first one I'm ready to be put on the spot. Yes

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.700
Thanks for the prep time Brent and then when you answer, I'll of course tell you if you're right or wrong and then

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.140
My own point of view Alan you ignorant. Yeah. All right. So the first question

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.790
What is quality quality is a term that people love to define?

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.520
Yes

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.400
There's philosophical answer Philip Crosby quality is free

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.480
Is it only feels it can it only be addressed philosophically?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.860
That's the good thing. So quality. Let me do both sides quality can be addressed

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.820
Philosophically because quality can mean different things to different people, right?

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.100
so it's

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.300
Quality is

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:17.180
So my definition of quality and then I'm gonna get into how you can actually be a little bit more scientific about it

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.820
but it's

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.460
how well

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.260
the customer or user of a thing

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.480
Views it as useful helpful. I'll say useful and helpful

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:39.930
Yeah, the I'm trying to extract it away from just software talk about quality in general, right? And when I think about a quality motorcycle

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.560
It feels good. It makes me feel good to use it. It's easy for me to

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.960
Operate

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480
I know

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:56.960
What it can do and can't do and I'm happy with that and I get joy out of using it

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.400
I could say the same thing about a table or a pencil or a piece of software

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.400
I it as you were talking you reminded me. I actually once wrote a blog on this

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.160
and I am vaguely recalling what I babbled about but

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.920
I do think quality is

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.720
for the most part sort of a

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.450
it

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.640
To address it in the abstract

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:30.160
You have to kind of address it in the philosophical level because I do think quality is individualized

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:38.280
Right. It's one of those things where no, there's it's it's highly personal. It's highly customized. It's it's based on the individual

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.920
Right, right. I can tell you some things. It's not and I believe these are in your book in your blog post

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.120
Its quality does not mean bug-free

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.310
No with you. I think it was in the same post you posed the question of

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.460
If you have two pieces of software one is has some note a lot of note bugs

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.460
But it's heavily used by

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.380
Thousands or hundreds of thousands of people and the other one is bug-free but used by ten people which one has higher quality

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.000
And even if you go back to my abstract definition of it's fun to use that

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.720
You know, I can get stuff done with it and it does what I want it to do

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.400
It's the one being used by more people it's a higher quality product in that definition

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:23.020
It yeah, so it's it's it seems a little counterintuitive you go, but but but but it has bugs

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.120
Well, no, that's so the thing is

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.280
Right. So we know how to determine which has higher quality

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.240
But that's not quite the same thing as what is quality, right?

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.760
and

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.640
I remember it was some of the things that I put in there it was

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:51.150
The context its ability to solve a problem in that context like there was another post where I talked about

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.240
Toilets oh great. Yeah where it's essentially

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.430
Does it solve the problem in the context in which

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.020
We're expecting to solve that problem

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.860
without the absence of

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.640
With the absence of unexpected consequences

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.220
Right. It's actually a chair

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:29.780
Was where I would go with like for example if I offered you a chair that didn't have a seat

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.380
You would generally view the quality of that as very low why?

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.860
Because you expect to be able to sit in the chair and it doesn't have a seat

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.780
Right. So it can't serve its basic purpose

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.100
but if they gave you a different chair and

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.050
Gave you a seat

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.970
but instead

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:57.010
Took the front right leg and cut off three inches off of it

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.300
Right, you can now sit on it and if you lean back, you're good

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.740
But if you lean forward you run the risk of falling on the floor, right? So there's

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.100
a

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:15.950
better chair wouldn't have the quality or that the characteristic of the

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.960
These chair crashes if you will then

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.280
Another one could be bells and whistles or comfort, right?

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.780
How delightful is the experience if I gave you?

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.640
sort of the

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:36.740
The old metal chair that grandma would offer you at Thanksgiving when you had to sit at the kids table or the nice

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.940
plush

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.140
rich Corinthian leather chair

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:48.820
Which one are you gonna prefer? Well the one you can easily fall asleep in right is is

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.540
the last one and then the the very

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:58.900
Very quickly reverse engineering the blog very last one is the context right a toilet is

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:05.700
In fact another version of a chair, but it's a special it's a specialized chair

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.600
But if I take that if I take a fully functional toilet

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.420
Right and I put it in the middle of a kitchen

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:25.860
Right the the quality of that toilet just immediately went down right so your quality is contextual. Yes, but

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:33.820
now if I take that that toilet kitchen combo and I move that whole thing to

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.930
a village in Africa

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.820
The quality just went up again

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:46.960
All right, so what you're saying is quality is largely philosophical it is okay

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.320
But it's largely philosophical, but we can decompose it into into smaller parts and am

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.960
well, I think what's important as

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:02.160
bringing back to the tester point of view is when you look at quality or evaluating quality trying to find out quality is

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.320
It's what it means for your

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.560
product and your target customer

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:13.670
Yes, so you need to it's so unique contextualize. It's not just bugs. It's not just

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:18.350
You know that no requirements or fitness for use or any of other things

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:23.210
now even right if I guess you go back to the Weinberg quote, which you've

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:30.410
Danced around but it's quality is value to some person it is and just thinking

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:35.890
Yeah, we can we can decompose that abstract statement into two other things

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.010
All right, are we gonna go this deep on all of them because we'll never make it

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:45.170
All right, do they get harder or easier? I think after we get through this one the rest become easier

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.840
Alright, so what is a test case? Oh, that's a good one because I was

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.440
There was a working group at Microsoft a decade ago trying to I come up with some

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.220
Terms like we should use these terms across the company and we couldn't decide

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:09.740
Test case was one of them and I think I even talked about test case in the in the power test software at Microsoft book and

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.740
I tried to come up with a meeting that

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:20.700
Made sense to me and to at least a large number of teams at Microsoft. So the test case is the

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.580
Oh should I call it the test check call it the check case the check case. Sorry

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.260
it's a

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.300
Specific and the reason I want to preface is it's a specific action and outcome

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:42.820
So it's it's it's it's a it's a thing you want to try and a result you want to verify now

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:49.180
Here's the question I have for you. So if I have to run I have a thing like I gotta pick an app slack post a message

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.660
One test case post a message make sure it post to the second user. There's a test case

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:02.980
I have to run that test case or that test case needs to be verified on the web client the desktop client iOS Android

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.290
Etc.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.430
What are the are those all test cases, too?

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.580
Why not and my answer is no because it's one test case the test case doesn't change

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.490
the

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.670
The test case the test case doesn't change its post a message verify that it's posted

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.400
When that fans out, I like to call those test points

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.540
Yet another new definition because it's the same again. It's philosophical

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:36.900
This is the one where the time officially reject the terminology test point because you just define equivalence class

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.980
No, yes

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.780
The equivalence class you this test case across multiple different browser

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:52.700
That's an equivalent as a math major an equivalence class is I'm going to treat all these values the same

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.820
But you're not going to treat all those test cases the same because they because having it work on

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.220
Windows Phone

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.500
People may not care about but it has to work on iOS and then the web

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.950
so if

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:11.010
So the point is I don't it doesn't matter. I wrote that

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.450
Eight years ago. I don't even know if I care anymore

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.250
But you do care I can tell you care your eyes say you care

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.750
That's why

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:28.270
Your team has a way of understanding what is a different, you know

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.610
Run these you have identical app for your

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.780
iOS and your Android clients

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.700
Fairly identical though under the hood. They're completely different

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:45.780
You are not going to write two test cases in whatever your test case management system is for post a

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.860
Post a message and make sure it can be viewed on iOS and another one post a message make sure it can be viewed on

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.860
Android you're gonna you're gonna share that one

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.320
But as long as your team has a way

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.000
Maybe Brent won't as long as your team has a way of understanding what that means

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.400
I don't care if you call them elephants light switches

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:13.080
Caborgas or caboom glass doesn't matter. How about fuzzy bunny fuzzy bunnies? How many fuzzy buddies? Did you run today?

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.090
Alright

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:25.980
So that one's I think even there it's slightly philosophical, but I think it's more shared understanding

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.460
It's a I can get my team

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.840
I think to have a shared understanding what a test case is much easier than it get my team to have a shared

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.940
Understanding of what quality is?

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.180
Um, I'm gonna try to combine the two

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.640
So my answer to what rent defines a quality case

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.340
my answer to

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:51.690
To what is a test case a test case is any time?

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.630
inputs are

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.890
applied to a program

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.330
Outputs generated in a judgment call made

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:07.990
Okay. Now it's that judgment call made that winds it back to the definition of quality. So

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.590
What I would say it's the same test case

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.220
But you're changing the context going back to the prior conversation

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:22.440
You're changing the context in which that test case would run therefore the judgment call might be different

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.360
So the judgment call is the Oracle so you could say your your definition if I paraphrase

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:33.110
Input plus output plus Oracle. Yes, I could get behind that awesome

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:40.910
The why didn't we have this conversation eight years ago before I wrote that stupid book I

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.830
Like I like things that input output Oracle done

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.990
Right, but again the Oracle isn't a static thing

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:55.600
You know the or winds it back to the definition of quality and the Oracle is the hardest part of testing it is

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.600
And since you say it's the hardest part of testing now, please tell me what is testing

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.960
This is another this one's gonna be largely philosophical and and

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:15.080
Maybe philosophical is the wrong word if I were to ask ten people what testing was I'm gonna get at least 11 different answers

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.700
That's true for test harnesses for sure. Oh

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.700
Don't even go there that's a whole podcast. Yep

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.580
To me testing is investigating evaluating

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.600
In fact, I'm gonna actually leave it at those two. It's

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.780
no investigating evaluating

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.920
learning and

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.440
Sometimes perhaps

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.760
Judging but I'm gonna leave that one off for now. I'm gonna go with the three. I'm going to

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.120
I'm going to

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:59.880
Disagree. All right, but I because I actually I don't think it's actually sometimes judging. I think it's only judging

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.280
So if we define the test case as input output in the Oracle

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.140
right the input and output

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.990
The inputs in a

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.620
Testing

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:21.220
Entities control the output isn't what what but the Oracle is why?

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:28.340
We hire testers about what that leaves out. No, it's not just the Oracle because often the

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.620
You may have a defined list of inputs and out the inputs and outputs

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:39.580
Yep, what the Oracle does in addition to evaluating the input and output. It gives you new ideas for inputs and outputs

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.100
So that's where the learning is

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.480
We're very abstract here. But you see I'm coming from I want to try I try entering in, you know

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.760
I send a message. I'll stick on the slack theme I send a message of

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.240
100 character 100 characters and it's fine and it outputs good judgment says looks good

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:07.440
Then I think oh, but what would happen if I could I send a thousand character or a ten thousand character message those

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.880
Were those were inspired by the last result that I evaluated

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.600
Often testers talk about breaking things or discovering where things fail. So by looking at the output of

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:26.120
By looking at their original judgment call their original Oracle from that I as a tester may derive

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.800
Directly or indirectly new test ideas, which are new inputs that I want to give to the program

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.360
So learning I can even go as far as learning and judging

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:43.170
Because evaluating maybe evaluating is close to judging but I think learning is a critical part of that

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:47.550
I know I agree and I'm I'm I'm changing my definition

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:54.110
Changing my answer not entirely because I still firmly think that the the the judging part

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.310
Because so as I go through this I'm thinking through

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:03.870
Right things we've talked about in the past around. Hey, we can have customers do our testing for us, right?

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.590
My definition of a test case applies to customer

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.070
Usage patterns, right?

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:16.510
The only input output Oracle for sure for sure the the only challenge with having customers do it is

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:21.850
It's often really hard to figure out. What was the judgment made?

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:26.590
That's where the data in the telemetry and that stuff comes into place whereas hiring testers

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:34.350
You just go talk to Bob down the hall. Hey, what was the judgment call but testing I think is is

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.050
Identifying

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:47.400
This is still too abstract. I think that maybe we working together can clarify this identifying

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.720
those judgment

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.240
calls

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.700
the

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:57.090
The judgments that would put the product at risk

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.410
okay, right so there's there is certainly a a

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.690
Science a craft an art. I don't think it's a philosophy around

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.690
Right. It's essentially

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.360
And maybe I'm framed

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.980
By by my coursework. So part of my coursework is this topic

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.940
That's well known in business and this risk management

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.500
Right what in in a risk management you spend a lot of time identifying

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:34.900
What exactly are those things that were uncertain about and then risk is classified as?

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.000
Uncertainty

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.760
Where there is a chance of a negative outcome and I think?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.400
Those words could be cleverly rephrased to define what is testing?

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.350
That's really what we're doing is we're trying to look for

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.240
negative

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:04.550
Outcomes or that's part of it. Most testers are looking for breaking bugs and things like that

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:09.390
So it's a negative outcome thing. Not a lot of testers. I know of are focused on

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:15.190
How do we make this delightful? They're more focused on how do we subtract pain?

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.850
You have things you want to say?

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.490
Probably I like the idea of subtracting pain. I

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.640
Forget what I was gonna say. Oh, okay

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.570
So

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:35.450
Where are we closing on? What is the definition? Oh, I so I don't know for closing on it, but your

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.890
idea of

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:46.090
Identifying what the risk is to the product or that or to the to say risk to the product that is

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.180
Unfortunately, maybe not for better or for worse

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:59.380
Sort of an advanced testing skill a lot of testers as you mentioned they can identify where the user pain is

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.180
But it takes experience to understand the difference between this is a bug

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.640
And we've talked just a few times go talked about this with some PMs on our team who?

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.430
Even though their experience is difficult for them to frame. This is a bug

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.930
Versus this is a bug that will

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:27.170
Automatically this is a risk to product. I'm wondering if so I agree with you from my history that that that you see

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.280
advanced testers

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.960
With that sort of knowledge you can but I'm wondering if it's because we're not

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.960
Explicit in their training up front on that. This is what they're doing

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:45.910
Right because I think a lot of us have gone through and we've made mistakes and through trial and error have after we've been here

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.590
20 years ago. Yeah, actually, that's what it is

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:53.750
And I'm like, you know, but to my knowledge very few people start

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.630
Their career in this space. Well, I think it's an experience thing

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:03.750
There are one of the CDT things I hear I don't have a CDT or not, but people in that community

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.230
say is

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:10.810
The role of testing is to provide information to the stakeholders and let them make the decisions

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.130
but I think

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.630
Often especially in my experience do you know experienced testers do make those decisions?

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:27.210
And that so I've never been happy with that definition the role of yeah provide information, right?

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:33.400
Because I do I'm not built that way. I don't believe that way. I believe we're not just info gathers

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.440
Yeah, that that deficient is I think to me assumes testers are passive

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:47.400
But low-level passive people right where I think successful testers depending on your definition of tester, which we can't quite get to

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.980
Requires much more

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:57.080
You know, there's something else is the say on this topic, but I have also now forgotten it

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.000
All right. Should we move on to a different definition that I can totally screw up

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.560
And be made fun of in the Twitter verse. So what is a tester then?

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.540
Someone who does that stuff?

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.440
It depends who you ask

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:17.130
honestly, I didn't the answer is that question is I have no idea because

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.570
Sometimes I call myself a tester. Sometimes I think I'm not really a tester anymore

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.330
Sometimes people call me a tester. Sometimes people say oh, you're not really a tester anymore

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:30.690
So what those things tell me is I have no idea what a tester is a tester is someone who does

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:37.630
Testing there's my tautology for the day. Let me let me let me

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:43.230
Give you a start of a definition and see how you how you might fill in the blanks

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.510
All right, a tester is someone

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.490
who brings

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:54.030
value to the business by

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.100
doing testing now see

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.340
That's that's

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:08.700
Tautological, right but it's about doing the activities we talked about it's about somebody brings value to the business by identifying

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:16.640
key risk key risks by right the someone who brings value to the business by

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.240
Evaluating and or by judging the product

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:27.060
I a tester is someone that's value to the business by it feels flat

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:31.620
It's right like if we take the the risk that we're brainstorming here

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:35.620
But if you if you take the risk definition that we talked about in the last one, right?

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:42.780
It occurred to me that you brought up my my blog posts around the debug free multi-user thing. Mm-hmm, right?

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.540
that sort of loose definition fits well in that

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.520
model as a test case

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.720
right because the

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.630
base on the usage pattern the

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.570
Even though there's the bug-free code

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:07.240
That's not being used

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.900
Right there. There's not only

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:18.540
Zero risk of a failure but because it's not being used there's zero risk of

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.840
value

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.720
So maybe actually testing isn't really just purely risk

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.820
but it's

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.860
In econ right there's the risk to return function

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:39.400
Right. So the the risk is very low in the bug-free code example, but there's no return

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:47.500
So a tester is someone who uses inputs outputs and their judgment in

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.710
order to make

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:52.350
decisions around

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.390
the value of the product to the customer I

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.820
Think a tester. I think that's close. I think a tester is someone

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.500
Who is keenly focused on the risk to return?

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.840
Function and they bring they bring value to their business

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.880
by

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.200
Removing a

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.880
lowering risk on the high value

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:29.800
Quality propositions. Yeah, and that answer because as the answer becomes more abstract it also tends to fit more

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.750
but

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:38.910
Right, but I've also added right. It's not quite as abstract as they do testing it it well

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:44.710
True true and the thing I like about it in terms of not the activity a

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:50.630
Tester is someone who achieves an outcome. No, what is the outcome? Yeah, I like that

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.630
I like where you're going with that because

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.910
testing is more than

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.550
input output judgment

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.670
Those are very focused granular tasks

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.150
That is a test case

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:08.880
So a tester has to perform more than test cases. I hope all the three realize that

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.240
One of the key things testers do selection as an example

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:19.080
What test what test do I run but looking at the product as a whole it's there are testers

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.040
I know who their job is to run a test case

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.080
Yeah input output judgment

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.400
Repeat 200 times done. I'm a tester

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.280
Yes, but that is nowhere near enough

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:36.800
You need to look at I could I could design a hundred test cases for any product right now

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:43.560
That would I could run them and they pass and the product would still be crap, right? Because it's about it needs to be about

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.480
Experience a lot of things that aren't

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:55.180
Well, they could be part of test cases but looking at everything as a whole it's the systems thinking part of testing and I would even

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.180
say further because

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:05.700
What I found with with tests. So now we're talking about test case selection, right? What are the test cases that are going to?

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:12.900
Bring to the that we're going to execute where the judgment would maximize the the value

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:18.940
to risk function, right you running 2,000 test cases that

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.000
Essentially add

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.560
Those 2,000 test cases add in essence a 2% addition to your code coverage numbers

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.800
right, I don't know that that the the test that you selected added a

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.880
right value to risk

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.380
right

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.120
Does that make sense? You're staring at me like you're just waiting for me to no

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:54.120
No, my phone started bringing in the background. I don't think the microphones will pick it up. It'll stop. Okay. What's next?

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.800
What is?

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.820
Integration testing it's testing integration next

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:11.820
Is that really what you're gonna do no, I'm gonna say it's there's that it's actually a Twitter conversation on this maybe a month ago

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.020
To me

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.750
This is another one where as long as your team has a definition

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.470
You may be okay. This is making sure all the pieces fit together

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:29.390
One definition I used often for integration tests was those are the tests you write to make sure other people don't break you

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.530
when you're looking at things so

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.810
but

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:38.550
That's an arguable definition. But at a high level it's

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.290
Tests that make sure pieces fit together if you are working on

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:47.120
The I'm working on the message

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:55.280
The the chat box I own that component in slack and you own the framework that works that works in

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:00.160
We can both make changes that could break each other the framework being like the whole like say you own the web page

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:05.080
It buy on the how the controls work together and I own the chat box. Yeah, we can both

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.000
Write tests that make it write code that make each other look bad

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.320
So what we do is we write integration tests that make sure that

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:21.200
I may have some tests for the framework that make sure I understand to my assumptions about how that web framework works are understood so

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.160
I can run those all the time and make sure that any changes you make aren't gonna break me and vice versa

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:31.120
Okay, to me those those that's my sort of standard definition of integration testing

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:37.580
But I do realize there it's a it can mean anything beyond your low-level functional testing

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.600
I'm gonna reject that and I think you can do better

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.670
So

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:50.750
Now what I'm gonna say because you did a lot of I think you got really close to something awesome

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.600
Oji, thanks Brent

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.080
Remember what we what we agreed on the definition of a test case

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.350
input output oracle

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:08.680
Now take that concept and with that concept firmly in hand. Tell me what integration testing this you tell me Brent

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.680
No, I don't have any head. I could do it, but I want you to do it

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:18.190
So integration testing you said it's it's the tests that you're right

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:23.990
So the test which means the test cases you write to make sure other people don't break you

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.690
Right. It's essentially

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:35.420
Input output, but now what is the Oracle in that situation Oracle is did you break me that the Oracle is essentially

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.920
does your

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.640
component

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:45.500
still return the expected results that my

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:52.320
Opponent is counting on. Mm-hmm. That's integration testing. I think it in a nutshell. It's the act of applying

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.520
I thought I thought I said

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.740
Now you said the tests to make sure that people don't break you

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:04.380
Did you you didn't tell me what I did the integration test is I said why we build them

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.840
whatever

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:15.470
What about my failing my interview so I get hired

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:21.590
No, all right. No, that's great. You didn't you did not fail you the interview

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:23.430
you

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:27.410
You made it very clear that you know what you're talking about

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:31.930
But perhaps we'll need to put you in some communication training. Whatever

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:38.040
What is perf testing testing performance? Of course. All right, then

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.760
It's another overloaded term I think perf and load and stress all get put into one big bucket

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.660
But yep, I'm going to given your leading questions before

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:57.080
these are the inputs and outputs that let me know that my

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.980
product is performing and I'll try to all

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:06.380
Elaborate to get rid of the technology as expected for example, so I I

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.900
distinctly separate

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:13.380
Performance from load and stress testing. So performance is I want to know how long

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.300
actions take in my

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:20.120
Application

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.120
over a variety of scenarios

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:27.640
So I want to know how long and we need markers or clementry for that or in the old days even a stopwatch

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.640
I want to know

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:35.320
Yeah, man do I do I do not miss those days? Oh my god

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.960
So look at the what are the kit I would identify

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:43.000
This is I'm talking about what I do and maybe from then I'll get it get a definition. I want to identify

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
What are the key?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:53.720
Actions my product takes and I want to know how long each of those takes and I'm going to

00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:01.960
run various test cases in different contexts very various inputs and outputs and my judgment is

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.200
Well, the output is the time my judgment is is that time sufficient?

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:12.820
Towards what I think my customers will like and they're all kind of awesome answer. I

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.530
Can't tell if he sarcastic or no. No

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:21.170
Because I was the no the thing I think is interesting

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:28.690
Right. Yeah, the one thing that I see with a lot of performance testing is they start off exactly what your you said

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:32.050
Which is hey, is it performing as expected?

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:36.810
But then it winds it back to well, what should we expect and and

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:41.610
One one of our colleagues Steve Rowe wrote

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.530
Blog I think a year ago

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.580
Where he talks about?

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.060
Test has lost its way. Did you read that blog? I

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.440
Did not where he talks about what what has happened is

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:05.640
Test hasn't has gotten had gotten trained into

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.980
Expected being whatever is in the PM spec

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.820
not necessarily

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.500
Sort of the the customer angle that you just took

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.980
Performance testing another cool follow-up question

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.420
Which you might have already destroyed

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.770
is

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:38.610
Faster always better. No, why not?

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:44.830
It only has to be fast enough for the customer if I have

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:48.750
I'm gonna go back to my canonical slack example

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:54.630
if the time I press enter to the time that post appears to you is

00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:02.570
200 milliseconds that seems almost instant to you and certainly is good enough

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:08.230
Do I want to spend a lot of time optimizing that go, you know what I can get this down to a hundred milliseconds

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:11.640
the user perception of that improvement is

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.780
almost none, especially when it's where when we're

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:22.540
Half a world apart and those numbers are made up mate. It probably takes longer. But again, you wouldn't notice. I actually did did

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:29.020
Some study and that's I'm forgetting the numbers but there's two numbers that I do remember. There's four things that I did

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:33.510
So

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:40.500
humans visually if it's they cannot perceive visually anything under

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.730
100 milliseconds

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:52.020
So we should make everything 100 milliseconds if everything was on 100 milliseconds it would as far as we're concerned

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.560
There are studies on this to show what the right numbers there for but again if you're dealing with distributed app

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:02.020
It can be longer but you can you it's really easy to over index on

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.600
increasing performance in the wrong areas and the the other one that I remember was

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.100
400 milliseconds

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.910
They can only perceive it if they are

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:25.750
Looking for it. So if you're if you're not if you click it and you're not paying attention to it anything under 400 second is is

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.040
Considered instantaneous. Mm-hmm

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.920
But if they're actually paying attention to it, they're singularly focused on it

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:39.800
Then they will detect it and there's another set of criteria around sort of audible clues

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.560
But I forget all these yeah, and there it's really easy to like I mentioned before it's really easy to over

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.600
Index on speeding things up that don't need to be sped up

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.440
and it's

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.360
you really want to focus on the

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.360
Sort of what are the top scenarios that not only can you over opt over index?

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.600
I'm trying to optimize something that's already good enough

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:09.060
But you may try and optimize a scenario that as far as customers are concerned doesn't need to be fast

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.660
Or it's not used very often you want to

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.880
This is beyond the definition

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:20.480
But for you know, the answer to perf testing is not make everything fast. It's make the parts that matter fast

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.880
So you need to do investigation and if and understand what?

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:30.360
What are the parts that need to be fast and how fast do they need to be and that is a huge part of actually

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.320
The performance testing performance testing is actually very much

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:40.330
You know input output judgment but that judgment that figuring that building that Oracle

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:44.250
Yeah, is it once again as I said earlier Oracle's the hard part oracles the very hard part requires

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:52.160
investigation and learning and an analysis to figure out and the Oracle not only is the hard part, but I think it's actually the

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:57.380
Only thing that's valuable. Mm-hmm. The other part is easy start and

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.060
subtract and then when it whining like as I've mentioned several times

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:09.260
The what's drawn me to data science is I have a huge passion around quality

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:16.980
And it now occurs to me as we're talking right now that it's actually a big part of what I'm doing in data science is

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.300
building better

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.300
accurate oracles and

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:30.820
Data science versus testing in this case right data science. I'm trained to measure that accuracy. How well does it

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:36.380
Does what I built fit the reality? Right?

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.660
All right

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:45.100
Were there more things on your list? No, we're good. So I think we're out of time, too

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:51.040
We are hey, thank you everyone, especially Patrick and per se for being part of our actually

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.520
I'm gonna check Twitter real fast to see if appears he replied

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.700
Nope. Nope, but

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:05.180
Didn't the the one of the a B testing live or live on a B testing hashtag did not catch on so

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:09.160
Possibly maybe coming to a slack near you

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.960
perhaps

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.920
Might be a new chat room with three people

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.320
All right, everybody. I am

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.480
Listening to Brent's phone. I am late. All right. See you next time. Bye
