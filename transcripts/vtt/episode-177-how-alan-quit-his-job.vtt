00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
We need to gamify chat GPT.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.150
And if you ask dumb questions, you lose points.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.620
If you ask questions that it could actually help with and, and make you

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.420
smarter, you get points.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.230
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.970
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.170
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.970
Now on with the show.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.900
Brent, man, it has been a long time.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.620
How are you doing?

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.340
I'm doing super duper.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.780
You look nice there.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.220
You're wearing a vest in your office.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.180
What do you think of the, Oh, Hey everybody.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.900
Brent is joining the beard club.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.610
It looks good on you because your face is not pretty.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.290
You look way better.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.730
I think so too.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.850
My, my wife disagrees.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.890
Well, um, yeah, I don't think I'm going to, I mean, I don't think I'm

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.970
going to, uh, I like as completely as I have now.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.450
So if, if I could fast forward to, to, to your stage, right.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.170
Uh, then yeah, I would go full on Viking style and like braid it with like cool

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.720
beads and skull and crossbones and things like that, but I, I'm a low maintenance

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.960
dude.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.280
I don't have the patience for that crap.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.800
Yeah.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.960
So I, oh, I have so many stories to tell and I'll probably go backward or

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.800
out of order, people can figure them out.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.480
But now mine's been trimmed like twice in the last six months.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.520
Once I just got it kind of trimmed because it was bad.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
And, but before that I could actually water it up and tie a knot in the bottom.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:54.190
And now I, I was in Monro, or for the Americans, Montreal, uh, took a vacation

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.110
up there because as astute listeners will know and people on LinkedIn

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.190
will know I quit my job.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.550
So I had some time and we'll, yeah, we'll talk more about that in a minute.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.470
But I got my beard trimmed and a guy, this guy did a really good job.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.510
He kind of took all the fluff off the side.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.510
So it was less puffy Santa Claus and more Viking down to my sternum.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.670
Kind of not really pointy, but you know, it's more point dish.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.230
It's a look I'm getting used to.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.350
I'm getting used to.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.150
So that's my thing.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.830
So anyway, it has been a while because there has been stuff going on

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.430
in my world, let's go backward.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.390
I took a week and went to Montreal before that.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.790
I took a week and went skiing.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.110
And before that I gave myself some time off by leaving my job at unity.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.870
I left that as an Easter egg in our very last podcast right before we logged off.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.190
And I said, like next time we can talk about how I quit my job.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.030
Yeah.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.750
And, and you're still, I presume under, under the, what is it?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.110
One year NDA.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.710
So the, your former unity employees will get no red meat here today.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.270
Correct?

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.950
Correct.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.190
Correct.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.310
In fact, I will, well, they'll get nothing I didn't share with them already.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.430
Ah, gotcha.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.550
And you know, it's different when I left and I have so many things to talk about.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.410
Let me start from pause there a moment and just kind of check it out as a whole

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.730
story there may take a while.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.380
You may have questions and I promised we'd talk about it, but it's

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.220
been like a month, maybe since we recorded last.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.100
So what have you been up to?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.860
How are you?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.820
You're still in your office at Microsoft.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.980
So you're, you're still employed, which is great.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.700
Yep.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:49.920
Still still employed and theoretically today is the last day, uh, for the, at

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.280
least the communicated layoffs as, as you know, that doesn't, doesn't mean

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.480
they can't circle back on Monday with a whole new set of communicated layoffs.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.760
Right.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.200
But for the most part, Satya thinks he's done for now.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.440
Is that what you're saying?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.440
No.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.120
Well, what I'm saying is what Satya announced back in January is supposed

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.560
to finish today, there was nothing he messaged around and that will be it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.080
for the year or the, or that would be unfair.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.560
You never know what's going to go on.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.200
So that's good.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.880
Yeah.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.400
All right.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.840
I assume your team charter is still the same, still working on, um, stuff.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.960
Yeah.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.640
Yeah.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.200
No.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.480
Um, we got a bunch of bunch of new, really interesting work coming in.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.640
And I'm looking into what I see what I'm trying to fix.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.960
Yeah.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.120
I'll just go with stuff.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.400
We're doing stuff.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920
Uh, it's cool.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.440
I don't have enough time to think about how I can make sure.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.360
The question really is the question burning the minds of all three

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.100
AB testing listeners is, is AI taking away your job?

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.570
Uh, not yet.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.850
I don't know if you saw the, well, so it's even bigger in the news now, right?

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:22.980
There's a, there's a big signed petition, uh, by multiple serious, uh, business

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.510
leaders, including ones that are heads of AI companies, trying to get the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.790
government to, to do some sort of pause on AI.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.390
Let's just pause the use of this for six months.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.780
It'll be weird to see if that can land, um, uh, for big things like so.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.420
Did you hear they bid you're they, they're putting a pausing big pause in

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.180
Italy, they banned chat GPT in Italy.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.140
I did not hear that.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.460
Yeah.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.100
Check that out.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.900
Uh, look at it right now.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.460
Unfortunately, things like that are going to do the square root of nothing.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.420
I know, but I, I'm just enjoying watching the world try and figure out,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.700
Hey, I had to handle this stuff.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.260
And in that some different kinds of innovation are going to happen.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.580
Some actual, we're, Steven Johnson calls, we're on the adjacent possible now of

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.740
some really cool things happening with chat AI.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.020
Now the enterprise computer, the computer from the enterprise from

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.860
Star Trek is like, yeah, that's totally possible.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.300
Just put some voice on this thing.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.540
Uh, yeah.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.140
I've also seen, uh, someone made Bard, which is Google's, uh, chat AI and

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.420
chat GPT, uh, square off in a rap battle.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.380
That was pretty cool.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.900
And, and who won?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.100
I don't recall.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.660
Just it's not who wins or loses.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.820
It's who plays the game.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.900
I have, uh, so I have seen a few several articles around that of course, make

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:06.220
me happy, uh, around Bard looking like, uh, a brainless monkey in comparison

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.540
to, uh, for example, the Bing chat bot.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.760
The I'm looking at the, the article you just said, and I think that one's.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.240
They're blocking it over privacy concerns.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.160
Right.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.320
And there's concerns with, uh, Dolly as well.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.200
Right.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.680
That, okay.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:34.320
So it's learning, uh, it's learning off of, off of available assets.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:41.040
Like if you are an artist, uh, there's a chance and you have something public.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.200
There's a chance that Dolly has been trained off of, off of your art form.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.800
Right.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.920
And we had a whole conversation about art last time and, and everything is derivative.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.800
Right.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.040
Right.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.240
Right.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.600
Right.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:59.980
But it'll be interesting that discussion around whether this, whether that is

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.940
really a privacy concern or not, or a copyright concern or not, right.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.420
That, that needs to be accelerated and closed.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:19.020
And then depending on the results of that one, um, then it's just going to be a crazy,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.890
even a faster, crazy world, or, or it'll be, you know, the, the doom will be

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.130
slowed down slightly.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.650
Like a, like a speed bump in a, in a grocery parking lot.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.130
Sure.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.290
Sure.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:43.300
It has internally, I will say it has created a big fuss.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.520
Like I would say right now we were preparing for intern season and I would

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:56.820
say, I don't know, 70% of the projects, uh, have the letters GPT involved somehow.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.640
I, of course, I'm going in a different direction because I understand what

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.560
GPT is right now.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.170
Uh, and I think a lot of these people are investing in science fair projects.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.170
Yes.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:10.850
Yes, indeed.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:11.610
Yeah.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:12.780
All right.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.140
Well, cool stuff going on.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.820
Um, I think AI will be a recurring, especially chat GPT.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.820
I, I, I now pay, I decided to pay the 20 bucks to get the more reliable,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.060
faster, more robust version and access to chat GPT for, for me, it's worth it.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.180
And again, I use it as a, as I mentioned before, not going to go into it.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.940
A brainstorming tool, the tool that helped me think about things, think

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.780
through things, summarize things.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.140
It is a collaborative partner for me.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.100
And that's my usage of that may have all over time, but I'm now a paying customer.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.180
So I'm into it and your prediction from December is coming true.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.500
Anyway, AI chat GPT will probably be recurring topics here.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.100
Worth checking in on what's going on.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.700
One of the things I will encourage you to do.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:06.020
You protect your is ask it to generate test cases for a calculator.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.290
No.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.210
Oh, okay.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.490
Good.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:14.650
If you're, if we're remarkably bored and you, you know, you have a choice between

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:21.050
trimming your fingernails again and doing that, maybe that, but even then it's sort

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:29.120
of an iffy, iffy case for me, try out the Bing chatbot along with the, the GPT

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.520
Ford GPT four is much better.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:38.920
Uh, but one of the things I am finding is the Bing bot, which combines the current

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.400
jet chat, be GPT model, the, the three five model, not four, along with

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.400
smart info retrieval, for me, it's producing much better results.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.440
And it has the benefit of being free.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.400
I will check it out.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.120
Yeah.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.280
So being.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:10:59.740
Yeah.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.380
Is that, I know that's going to be hard.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.020
What is, what is Bing stand for?

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.020
Is that an acronym?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:05.780
Yeah.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.900
It's, it's short for being, being, being.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.780
Oh my Lord.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:20.300
So you picked on a very good metaphor or comparison earlier because I am maybe

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:26.380
my only neuroses, but definitely my biggest one is I cannot stand my fingernails

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.500
not being sheared all the way back.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.700
Oh, really?

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:35.860
Like I can feel the weight of them and throw like a millimeter law just feels weird.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:43.360
Oh, I, so if it's too short, then I can't pry things open.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.720
And obviously playing the guitar is better with a little bit of

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.050
nailage, but I guess you don't, on the right hand, I suppose nails

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.490
getting the way of, yeah, no, on the left hand, it's annoying.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.250
I assume playing right hand guitar.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:57.490
All right.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:57.890
Yeah.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.250
Yeah.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:11:59.630
Hey.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.830
So anyway, I, um, I quit.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.400
You did.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.200
And, and then you banned me from talking about it.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.400
No, I didn't.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.160
No, I well, I didn't, I didn't.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.400
Uh, I decided to leave and it's a, you know, it's a long story.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.400
I wish no ill will on unity.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.720
It's different from Microsoft where I was just done.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.880
I had a manager at Microsoft who was to compare my last manager at

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.680
Microsoft was a total shithead.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.640
He is the epitome of everything you can do wrong as a manager.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.680
The first one ever, although you hear stories all the time, the first

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.240
one ever who made up stuff in my review, I didn't do.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.680
And it was just, he was just horrible.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.390
There was a culture of sucking up.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.150
You remember Brian?

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.630
Yeah.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.190
Yeah.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:48.510
Yeah.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.750
It's like, I just can't work.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.350
This is not the culture I want to work in.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:57.310
And if you recall, if you recall, I was scared.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.910
AF when I found out that you moved in to Brian's org.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:03.710
Yeah.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.150
It was fun for a while.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.870
It was a good experience.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.470
I liked it, but it was good to get out as well.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.790
So different experience leaving unity.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.390
And like, let me give you the example.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.580
I told my manager, I was leaving and gave him a bunch of reasons why.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.580
They said, yep, those make sense.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.100
And it says, I've never successfully talked to anyone out of resigning.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.860
So let's just figure out how to make a good transition.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.820
And we did.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.020
And I'm super happy with, I won't go into details on the podcast.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.860
If you're at unity and listening, of course, you know, what my suggestions were,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.980
because that's, that's what happened.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:46.380
And I'm really happy with how simple the transition went, how nice everyone

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.020
was and everyone at unity is great.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.100
I'm not going to go deep into the reasons I left.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.300
I'll go a little bit.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.900
It was a little bit of culture.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.820
What I can say is the culture was nowhere near as like as bad as I felt

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.900
Microsoft was at the time.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.580
And I, and from talking to you and others, I trust that Satya is making a difference

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.540
and that the culture, the siloed backstabbing culture of Microsoft when I

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.260
was there is, is indeed slowly fading away.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.220
Uh, it's backstabbing is nearly gone.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:18.820
Yeah.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.780
A couple of the things.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.700
So my experience is my org, my manager, totally fine.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.260
It was, it was a great place, great org to be in.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.260
I could do what I wanted.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.860
Plenty of, plenty of additional room for growth there.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.940
What it really came down to for me was in the position I was in as a

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.660
VP reporting to the CTO.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.420
So my skip level was our CEO.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.940
I was dealing a lot more with executives from across the company.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.860
Most of which were fantastic and great people and humble and everything.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.500
There were a few, and I'm not going to name names and this is maybe a little

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.500
more than I went to, went into directly with my team at Unity, but still well

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.820
worth sharing, um, and they could have drawn the line easily.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:09.380
There are a few of the senior leaders that happened to be folks who were at

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.100
Microsoft when I was there, who I did not like when I was there because that

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:19.760
they were very much that frat boy, good old boys culture of, you know, you

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.720
remember what it was like.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:28.290
No, uh, they're the type of people that we wanted to improve the culture.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.890
We wanted out of Microsoft.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.130
Right.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:35.050
And they left and like, and so, and a couple of them went to, from there,

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:42.450
went to Amazon where they became more business savvy versions of the old

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.570
frat boy backstabbers they were.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:52.810
And in interacting with them and seeing that their spots didn't change that much

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.570
and being, you know, I'm pretty good in influencing culture, even in

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.450
places that aren't mine, but these were, it was a hardship to move and

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.650
I could have worked around it.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.260
I could have, there was no, I can't work here anymore.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.060
This is too hard.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.340
This was like, this is hard and I'm old and I don't feel like doing this anymore.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.930
So that was really what kind of left up to it.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:19.220
Some things just didn't feel like it was easy to do good work anymore.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.300
And that was, it's not that it's not easy to do good work at Unity in general.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.460
In my position, it was because the people I had to go influence,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.660
they lost my respect.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.820
So I decided to step away and, and it was really cool as I gave specific

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.860
reasons to my manager, none, which I share with my team, none, which I'll

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.980
share here, a very pointed example after example, or after example, where

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.100
I felt things weren't right.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.900
And it was really cool was most managers would try and tell you like, this

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.500
is wrong, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.220
He agreed with all of them, whether he did or not, I don't, whether

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.180
he really did or not, I don't know.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.340
But he agreed with all of them and said, yep, these are problems.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.260
And it's going to take about a year, maybe two for, to get these things

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.020
ironed out and get things smooth again.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.980
And I told him, I think you're exactly right.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.580
I just don't have the patience right now at this point in my

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.180
career to ride that out.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.300
So I'm going to take a break.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.620
I'm old.

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:18.550
I've done that.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.710
No, it's I get it.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:21.070
Right.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:25.950
It's at some point in time, you want to stop fixing the same

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.500
problems and see what happens on the other side of the mountain.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.140
Maybe, maybe.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.420
Well, and I want to fix problems.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.220
I don't mind fixing some of the same problems.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.820
Some of yes.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.180
Greeting.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.460
When I feel, when I have confidence, I don't need a lot because, uh, I

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.460
don't need a lot of confidence.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.020
I want to feel like there's a path where I can be successful.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.020
Sorry, I'm way too esoteric here, but yeah, it's, um, I decided to leave.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.100
So then what happened was I did the thing where my last day was

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:04.140
March 17th in the office, but I was on vacation for two weeks.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:10.410
My actual official last day was the 24th for reasons that are confusing and

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:15.050
actually ended up not being valid at the end anyway, I waited until it's on the

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.090
24th, I did go turn in my laptop on my card key at the Bellevue office.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.130
And, and it was a little surreal.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.290
Somebody else I knew who was at Microsoft quit the same day and his

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.530
laptop was back there too.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:31.410
And our receptionist we call workplace experience was kind of expecting me.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.210
He said, Hey, she said, all the dinosaurs are leaving.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:34.730
I said, what do you mean?

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.930
He was a dinosaur.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.610
And she said, no, that's what we just called anybody who remembers the old

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:40.930
building we call dinosaurs.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.450
So, okay.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:41.730
Okay.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.650
Then I'm a dinosaur.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.810
The first one, oh my God.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.450
Like the old building was what?

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.220
Four years ago.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:48.380
Yeah.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:48.620
Yeah.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:48.780
Yeah.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.300
We moved out four years ago.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.550
Yeah.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.910
The one next to our, what toys are us used to be?

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:58.310
Yeah.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.670
Yeah.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.030
Anyway, I turned to my stuff and I was like a little surreal.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.390
I walked out and walking back to my car and from my phone, I posted a quick

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.230
little LinkedIn thing that said something to the effect of, I don't have it in

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.940
front of me, so something to the effect of, well, that's that after six years

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:19.220
at unity, I turned in my card key and laptop today off to see what's next.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:25.220
And so many, I mean, there's like a dozen comments, 15 comments, a bunch

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.180
of reactions, a whole bunch of DMS, a whole bunch of messages elsewhere.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.300
And I was kind of touched.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.700
A lot of people concerned about me.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.690
Like, are you okay?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.570
Like, and these days, like it was left.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.010
Did you quit?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.490
What happened?

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:38.970
Why would you quit in this economy?

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.730
Are you stupid?

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.330
I'm a little stupid, but, uh, but I was, it was really, and then on our

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.370
Slack group as well, it's like, Hey, Alan, I just heard you quit.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.250
Is everything all right?

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.890
And yeah, it's great.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:57.240
It is great to be in a position where you feel like you could, like taking

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.800
a break is the best thing for you.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.850
People I haven't heard from in years checking in on me, some unfortunately,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.090
people that have been laid off from Microsoft recently out there wondering,

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.450
looking for commiserating on, well, where are you going to end up?

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.210
Could I end up there?

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:12.410
What?

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.010
I, and I don't know.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.130
I mean, everybody has their own path and journey, but anyway, the short story

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.930
is a lot, I didn't think I thought there was no picture.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.450
There was no interesting blog post to go with it, just a quick little blurb.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:30.970
So I was kind of, um, surprised and touched over all the concern and the

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.090
comments from people on, on me leaving.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:34.770
Are you okay?

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.730
And yes, for anyone listening to the podcast, I'm sure far more people see

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.890
my posts, like 10 people see my posts on LinkedIn and only three

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.330
people listen to the podcast.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.910
But if you happen to be both, yeah, I'm doing great.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.950
I'm fine.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.870
I feel good.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.750
I'm relaxed.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:53.670
I'm rested.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:59.590
I've had a very, very nice break and things are going well.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.070
So yeah, that's that.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.790
Yeah.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:15.820
So you did not leave without understanding a better, uh, I'm

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.940
being, trying to be very careful.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.340
Life for yourself post leaving, right?

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.220
It wasn't, it wasn't F this place.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:31.330
I'm out of here and you left after thoughtfulness and some

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.890
form of prescriptiveness.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.570
And unfortunately in right now, like everything is layoff heavy.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.690
I understand why everyone might think, right?

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.490
You didn't have a choice in the matter or you were pressured

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.410
negatively in it.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.610
I know some of the details and I'll absolutely say that's, that

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.450
that's not what happened here.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:58.090
Um, can I just talk a little bit about it because it's something

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.410
we've talked about before, not in a while, but really I was

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:06.370
experiencing burnout is, is, is the, the gut of it from a lot

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.130
of different things.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.850
And so when I got to the end, I, it was hard for me to wake

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.530
up in the morning and go to work.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.970
I've been getting up and I got, I changed this at the first

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:17.290
of the year.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.410
So I've been feeling, I've been thinking about leaving all

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.570
the way back since November.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.720
And I thought it was just getting up early.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.800
I've been getting up at 6 AM or 5 30 AM four days a week,

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.660
sometimes five, uh, for the last couple of years after the

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.660
first year, I changed my schedule so that my first meeting

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.780
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday wasn't until seven 30

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.560
at the earliest.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.920
I started early on the other days, still pretty early for,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.520
for a West coaster still was having a hard time getting

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.760
engaged and you know, the layout, I'll admit the layoffs

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.320
are part of it.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.640
I, you know, I disagree with the way the layoffs are

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.440
done at unity, but what happened was I couldn't get

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.000
engaged.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.520
I could go through the motions.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.680
I could take care of my team.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.960
I could go to meetings and make decisions and do the

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.200
minimum really, but there were any sort of the extra

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.040
work that I liked to do.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.080
I didn't call it extra.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.560
It's just really just doing stuff beyond the meetings,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.920
like just coming up with strategic plans and helping

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.800
a lot and doing the extra work to align around what's

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.040
important and digging in with our partner teams,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.320
understand what we're going to do.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.760
I had no energy for that.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.950
I was obligated through just care about keeping the

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.430
team running and keeping them successful and happy

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.470
and engaged, but I couldn't find any energy to

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:38.670
engage beyond there.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:43.780
So there was a three day weekend in January.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.020
I turned into a four day weekend and completely

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.420
unplugged, tried to see if I get back into it.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.060
It didn't work.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.140
So then in fab around presidents day, I took a

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.820
five day weekend or maybe a big chunk of time.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.020
Not well, anybody in Europe would go.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.900
That's not a big chunk of time, Alan, but for,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:00.940
for Americans.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.260
Yeah.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.500
So I took a longer weekend again, completely unplugged,

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.540
just tried to meditate and relax and just see if I

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.220
could find it again.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.780
And I came back and I couldn't.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.420
And that when I came back and I couldn't, that's

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.460
when I typed up a letter of resignation and my

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.540
manager was on, uh, or traveling that week.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.100
Complication.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:22.780
I can't remember.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.220
So when I met with him the next week is when

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.140
we had that discussion.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.740
So it was, it was a long time coming.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.860
It was definitely not a table flip run out the room.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.940
I really, really tried to make it work in my head,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.610
but in the end, you know, I told the story back

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.290
at Microsoft, it was hard to leave.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.650
And I finally made the decision to do it.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.450
It felt right.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.050
And the same thing happened with unity.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.450
It's a different, different culture, different

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:52.090
situation, but it was, it was the right thing.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.410
And, and I'll say, so I'll say two things.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.890
Number one, when you left Microsoft, it was

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.090
absolutely right.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.570
Like the, the, at least the two to three

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.180
years that followed that has been the most

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.060
energized I had seen of you, Alan.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:12.700
Right.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.730
It was, you know, we joked, joked in quotes, like

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.050
when you were here, you were kind of following,

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.610
uh, a variant of the Moore's law in terms of

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.570
how long you stayed in a group.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.390
Right.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.830
Um, one of the things that we share in

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.770
common, right.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.570
We, we, we, we are fascinated by where ideas

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.570
come from.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:45.300
Uh, uh, I think we both share commonality

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.580
that when, when the thing gets to the point

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.180
where it's a, it's a greased engine that just

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:58.900
runs, at least I get intensely bored rapidly.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:25:59.980
Right.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.140
And if, if, if I can't find something that

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.460
reenergizes me a new direction, a new

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.380
opportunity, something else to build ROI on.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.870
Um, yeah, then it's, it's, it's, it's time

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.550
for me to go to find something else.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.590
That's, that's kind of how I've been

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.950
interpreting your story.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.990
Um,

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.750
a little bit, it's very clear that when

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.430
I'm bored, I'm done.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.010
And this is a little different in

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.850
that the boredom came, it wasn't really

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:32.330
bored.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.500
I just couldn't, I couldn't, it was a

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.660
weird place because I wasn't bored.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.320
But maybe I kind of was because I

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.240
couldn't, I was unable to find, to motivate

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.640
myself to do the super engaging things.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.040
The thing, the things that where I

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.040
would get growth from.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.980
I was just, you know, we talk about my

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.900
ACM model of having the above work or

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.700
the ambitious work that stretches you

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.900
and the stuff you're just good at

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.580
and the other stuff.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.740
I was eliminating all the ambitious

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.060
stuff because I just, I couldn't get

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.020
the energy to do it.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.300
So I was just doing stuff in my

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.690
wheelhouse stuff that I knew how to

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.530
do, but I wasn't stretching myself at

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.130
all and I had no desire to stretch

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.850
myself at all.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.570
And so that's, that's a flavor of it

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.130
because anytime I'm not stretching

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.290
myself at all, I changed jobs.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:19.900
Yeah.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.380
It's just the path that I got there

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:22.980
was different.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.420
So I have now been in Azure, I

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.740
think eight years.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.640
And there have been times where I'm

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.650
just like, okay, what the hell to do

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.130
now?

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:34.690
Right.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.410
Where I fall back and right.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.890
I do things in my wheelhouse because

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.620
you know, I'm at minimum I'm paid a

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.660
salary, I should be producing

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.180
something useful.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.100
Right.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.740
But, but if that lasts more than

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.220
a week, well, I guess thankfully

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.140
for me, it hasn't.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.020
Well, let me talk about one more

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.100
thing that I do that it hasn't

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.700
come up yet, but actually very much

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.660
part of this decision.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.900
I haven't mentioned it yet.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.020
Uh, but it was very much a part

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.780
of my decision.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.710
As you know, one of the things I

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:15.070
love to do, and this is, uh, you

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.430
know, not for the faint of heart.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.270
I love to work myself out of a job.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.770
Do you think you did that this time?

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.410
Um, I actually, I didn't work

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.970
myself out of a job, but I did

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.170
work myself out of a job.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.850
Let me, let me, Brent has a

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.810
skeptical look, so let me explain.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.490
So I think, I think you're prior

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.930
prior to the reorg you were last

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.690
day, I think you had, I think that

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.850
was the reason why the reorg happened.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:41.450
Yeah.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.170
Well, let me give you the context.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.970
So part of it was I was dumb, but

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.530
also part of it was I shared this

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.970
with my directs at unity.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:50.850
And I believe it.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.130
And part of the realization on that

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.210
five day weekend that came to me was.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.990
My directs still have, all of them

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.030
had definitely room to grow and they

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.190
thought like they didn't need me.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.830
But I also felt like they had matured

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.510
enough that every single one of them

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.910
could run their own business.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.700
Once I gave them that realization, had

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.940
a similar realization about how.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.100
We could keep everything running

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.520
at with minimal disruption and suggested

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.840
that to my manager and all those steps

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.680
happened and basically without going

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.200
into details and I'm very confident

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.840
of the team's ongoing success.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.750
My manager will not replace me.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.100
Oh, interesting.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.500
So I came, I had a plan I thought would

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.340
work and all the pieces fell into place.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.060
People were willing and open to it.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:48.060
And, and I think the org will be very,

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.340
very successful, at least as successful

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.820
it would have been if I was there.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.700
Without the need to replace me at all.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.140
So,

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.260
do you think he's gonna, do you think

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.740
he's going to spread out your team

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.620
amongst his current?

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.620
No, I know, I know exactly what he's done.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.540
I'm not going to go into details of what

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.260
we did there.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.540
It's not important for the podcast,

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.220
but if I can leave and in a way that

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.460
does not cause me to need to be replaced,

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.300
you could say I was able to work

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.260
myself out of a job, at least in some

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.580
context as part of this or the preparation

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.460
or the basis for that was done.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.180
That's what I'm saying.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.340
Okay.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.070
Yeah, that's good.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.710
That's great.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.470
Yeah.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.390
So I will, I'll find the new place to land.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.070
I will learn a lot and stretch myself

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:38.840
and eventually work myself out of a job.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.480
In which case I will, I've been very,

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.000
very fortunate and lucky in my career.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.040
In that when I work myself out of a job,

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.840
I'm able to find the next one.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.520
That's even harder and harder to,

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.880
harder to work myself out of.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.200
Yeah.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.960
And I don't do it on purpose.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.160
I, I don't know.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.440
I think it's laziness.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.240
Like I want to do less and less of my

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.080
job, so I'd make people do more and more

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.760
of it and eventually I'm not needed.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.320
I don't know how it happens.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.200
I don't, it's not a conscious thing.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:06.520
I do.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.800
I don't like put on my goals, work

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.960
myself out of a job.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.080
It's something that happens when I do

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.760
my job and then I, in hindsight, I go,

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.520
oh wow, I work myself out of a job again.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.280
I can't explain, there's no strategy around it.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.800
It's an artifact of doing things the way I do.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.760
It's super weird.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.800
I do a similar thing.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.000
And then at times I actually, I stare into it.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.520
Like there's a, there's a rarely used

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.320
joke I do with my ICs.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.040
So let's say my IC is on a challenging

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.980
problem and I'm like, yeah, Brett, I just

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.140
have no clue how I'm going to solve it.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.620
And I know their experience and I know

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.140
it's, it's, they're perfectly capable of it.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.460
And then sort of setting the scenario

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.140
wrong just to get to the punch line.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.860
But I will look at them.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.980
I'll say, Hey, would you like to know how

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.060
I intend to solve it?

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.720
And they're like, yes.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.920
And I'll say, okay, I'll tell you upfront.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.160
It's not going to help you much.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.560
Let's find, let's hear the idea.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.320
Okay.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.640
What I'm going to do is hire a really

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.200
smart person to do this thing and then

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:22.800
delegate it.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.190
And then they'll look at me like, Oh,

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.990
you're an asshole.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.150
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.070
I am like the context.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.350
I didn't tell the scenario, right?

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.550
But the context is when, when they found

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:39.190
some sort of strategy to get out of the, to

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.980
get me out of coaching mode and they're

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.660
trying to sort of reverse delegate back to me.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.740
And I'm like, no, I want you to work

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.540
through this and I'll do this and I'll

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.540
follow up after I do the joke and say,

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.860
no, this is, this is something I think

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.980
it's important to you as well as the

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.220
business to, to invest in.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.620
And, and right.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.020
We're knowledge workers.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.300
Knowledge doesn't come for free.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.260
At least not entirely yet.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.860
Uh, chat GPT is working on fixing that.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.500
And, and, you know, uh, just as an aside,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.740
I'm already seeing signs of, of GPT

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.980
encouraging intellectual laziness.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.930
And that scares the crap out of me.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.450
How you use it.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.370
I, I think a lot of the ways I see you

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.770
is wrong again, we're not, we already did

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.970
the AI portion of the podcast, but I use

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:39.010
it to, I use it to learn, to expand my

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.250
creativity, it's my partner in figuring

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.010
out ideas.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.970
So I don't think there's for me, at

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:46.370
least there's no laziness.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.610
I think as people figure out what to

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.570
do with it, there definitely is the

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.810
possibility for that.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.010
And if I were programming chat GPT,

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.530
and again, we're out of, we did this

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.650
section already of the podcast.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.010
I would teach it.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.170
I want to mean chat.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.490
Like I want to chat GPT.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.810
I want to give it a prompt that says,

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.730
if I ask you something stupid, that's

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.490
inappropriate for you, please tell me

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.730
what a dumbass I'm being.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.370
Yeah, it won't do that.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.290
Yes, it will.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.930
Many of the prompts are set up to

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:16.610
prevent you from, from it doing

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.410
anything that could even have a

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:19.850
hint of being offensive.

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:21.690
I'm saying program it.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.050
So it does.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:23.650
It does.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.410
Oh, if you worked, oh, I got it.

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:26.090
I missed it.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:26.610
Make it.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.050
Sorry.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.050
Yeah.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.250
Turn it into, um, make it, make it

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.570
meaner, I don't get more opinionated

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:34.010
and meaner.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.530
We, we, as you've called that, I

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.890
think three times in the last 30

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.640
seconds, it is not, uh, we've already

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.160
done the AI segment.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.760
Uh, but I'm, I'm definitely of the

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.640
belief now that anything resembling

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.070
EQ for an AI, uh, if I had a choice,

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.910
I would just, you know, not even

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.230
partially just straight up, let's

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.950
just start calling that unethical.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.180
I don't want it calling names.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.580
I don't want it praising you.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.660
We need to gamify chat GPT.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.510
And if you ask dumb questions, you

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.750
lose points if you ask questions that

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.540
it could actually help with and, and

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.780
make you smarter, you get points

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.300
and you can use those in anyway.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.220
So moving on fine, fine.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.900
I think I saw that, uh, star field

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.140
announced a date that I see that

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:28.820
right somewhere.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.460
I thought it was September.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.580
Yeah.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.620
Countdown.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.130
I have done none far away.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.340
Yeah.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.420
So what's new in entertainment?

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.940
I got a, I got a catch up on other

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.460
games first before that comes out.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.420
I'm still working my way through

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.180
Mario Odyssey and the Harry Potter

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.300
game and a whole bunch of other crap.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.020
I, I think I'm caught up.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.140
You're watching the Mandalorian.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.820
Uh, I today is Friday.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.740
I did not see last night, but I was

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.860
caught up up until then.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:35:59.980
All right, man.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.220
Is it, come on Wednesday night.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:01.500
Anyway.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:01.820
Okay.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:02.580
Good caught up.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.460
No, you're right.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.220
It is Wednesday.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:05.380
Yeah.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.180
It's getting better.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.300
I, I, a lot of people are not liking

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.700
the Disney star Wars series.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.260
I like them all very much.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.020
The Mandalorian is frigging awesome.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.180
I was talking to somebody last week

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.660
and I said, I, I, and I believe this.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.980
I said, I think Andor to me is a better series.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.480
Oh, for me, Mandalorian is better.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:27.920
Yeah.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.600
And, but the reason he gave why Andor was not,

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.400
and this is, this is true.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.280
Star Wars geekdom is that he said it's

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.760
too human centric.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.000
The star Wars universe has lots of weird

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.680
looking aliens and because Andor doesn't

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.440
have enough of those that it's inferior

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.280
to the Mandalorian.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.360
Okay.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.600
I think that's a weird take, right?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.360
Anyway,

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.980
in that regard, I mean, by that bar, you

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.540
would say, okay, is it really part of the

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.260
star Wars ethos, right?

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.980
That, right.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.980
So that is one thing I will say, right?

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:11.860
It doesn't, it didn't come across as Star Wars.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:12.740
Right.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.700
It, it, it, it's in the universe.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.930
But you could have, you could have picked

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:23.780
any sci-fi universe and like, it's a good

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.060
story.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:25.780
Okay.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:31.200
But Star Wars in my view is, is only mentioned

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.760
there as part of a brand, right?

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.350
The rest of the Star Wars brand doesn't

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.790
really make sense for that story.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.430
That part I, I will agree with.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.950
I don't, I don't really care about that.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.950
The alien thing or whatever, but right.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:51.070
The, the, the empire versus the rebellion.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.110
Those are just all story assets.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:56.670
All right.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.150
But what are you watching new?

00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.710
That's good.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.390
What are you watching our play in new?

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.990
That's good.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.630
Uh, Mandalorian is what I'm watching right now.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.950
I've, I've gotten to the end of DC stuff

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:12.310
on, uh, I'm at the end of Marvel.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.470
I'm at the end of DC stuff.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.720
Uh, so it's time for me to go back and see

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.520
what's interesting on, on Amazon prime.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:23.760
Right.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.160
Cause right now, Mandalorian, I'm glad that

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:27.880
you told me that.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.880
Uh, and then baseball season started up again.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.560
So I got, I got, I got that to watch now.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.600
I'm very excited about it.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:35.680
Nice.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.080
How is your hour?

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.920
The, I was a local team going to do this year.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.280
Well, they, they have won a hundred percent

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.520
of their games yesterday was opening day.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:45.760
Yeah.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.440
Nice.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.200
Nice.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.240
Are they going to win the next 161?

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.890
Probably not.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:53.530
Right.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.970
I'm not, I am a data scientist.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.090
I think that statistically unlikely, but I

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.690
would love to see if they could get into

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:00.690
the playoffs again.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:03.130
Last, last season was really exciting towards

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:03.490
the end.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.170
Yeah.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.530
Cause they got to, they got to go to the

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.010
playoffs.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.530
Yeah.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.050
Oh, and by the way, I've been helping my

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.170
daughter with her statistics homework.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:11.850
Yeah.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.610
Um, so I'm, I'm, uh,

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:14.810
and have you survived it?

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.700
Sometimes, sometimes I go, yeah, I know this.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.700
I was like, Oh, what?

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.140
What did that?

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:20.740
Why?

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.620
What?

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.380
So, um, yeah, doing all right.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:24.980
Doing all right.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.940
It's kind of fun stuff.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:26.940
Okay.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.660
I don't think I have anything else exciting

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.260
going on.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.580
Just talk about my desk.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.180
So we're, we're recording again next week.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:36.460
Yeah.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.220
Back to back.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.980
This is one 77 by the way.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:39.580
Yeah.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.620
And the reason why we're doing that is

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.780
because normally we do it every other week,

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.340
but it's been a while since we recorded

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:51.890
and the week after that, I am on vacation.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.770
My daughter is doing a class trip and

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.010
we're going to go check out Philadelphia

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.090
and DC.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:00.810
Oh, cool.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.410
It's so, I have never been to DC.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.810
I've always wanted to go.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:05.930
I've never been there.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.810
I, I will get there sometime soon.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.530
I have never been to either.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.330
I've never been to any of the places

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:15.850
that we're talking about and we're going

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.970
to be, so as you know, I graduated from an

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.450
online school, we're going to be within

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.170
an hour and a half drive to the actual

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.770
school I graduated from, which I have never

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:27.570
actually been to.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.490
Funny.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.970
Yeah.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:29.330
Funny.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:29.650
Cool.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.650
Yeah.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.290
So anyway, it's good to be back.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.410
Um, thanks for everyone for hanging out

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.730
and being patient between podcasts.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.650
Good seeing you again, Brent.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:37.570
The beard looks good.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:42.260
Everyone else have to trust me and, uh,

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.140
I'm unemployed, Alan.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.140
And I am still still employed, Brent.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.660
We'll see you next time.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.380
Bye.
