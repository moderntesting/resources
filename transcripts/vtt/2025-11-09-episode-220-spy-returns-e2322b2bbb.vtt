00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.780
Welcome to A.B. testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.500
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.780
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.580
Now on with the show.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.420
Hey, everyone. I'm Alan. No, I'm not. From now on, I will only be referred to as spy.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.420
I do not answer to my government name anymore. Please don't use me that name.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.780
I will correct you. Brent isn't here. There's no B.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.140
So we have Bani, Bani, Bani fought and Bondreas.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.580
I have Andreas Varming and Danny thought are here to talk about stuff with me

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.380
because I felt like doing a podcast. Welcome. Say a quick little intro.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.300
Say hi, everybody. And something, something interesting.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.780
Go Danny, you're up. Hi, I'm Danny.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.260
This is my second time appearing on this stream,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.380
but the first time on the actual podcast. So that's very exciting for me.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.500
Glad to have you here, Andreas.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.140
Yeah, Global Varming is a nickname on the slack.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.580
And it's almost second time here. We have like a suite for three or something.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.860
And I hope I don't embarrass myself like last time.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.230
I embarrass myself every single day.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.150
So if this is your first episode, this is weird because this is our first episode

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.230
in maybe close to six months. I can't count that high.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.670
I was gone for four and a half months, took a long walk, had some fun,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.390
met some cool people, saw a lot of animals. It's pretty much it.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.470
Got back about a month ago. There's a map over your shoulder.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.090
You know, intriguing.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.610
Yeah, there's a map over my shoulder of the Pacific Crest Trail.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.330
It's been there forever.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.810
It was there for six months before I told my last company I was leaving.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.200
They just never nobody ever asked.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960
And then I can say this now.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.380
So I think I might have been clear about this on the last.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.780
I can't remember. It's the week to week is gone from the last podcast.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.060
But because it was six months ago, a last job wasn't a good fit for me.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.300
I am unemployed right now, so that's worse, I guess.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.980
But one of the things I figured out on the trail was that for my next role,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.500
I want a job that I really like and I feel like I'm valued,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
that I have fun at and do what I'm best at.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.620
What I'm best at is building engaged teams

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.980
and people who like to grow the career, understanding how that works

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.700
and building good software.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.300
And my last gig, they kind of didn't care about either. And my

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.500
when I left that job, my blood pressure was high like it was when I left Microsoft.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.330
And now I went to get a physical a month ago after I got back.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.610
And like my health is like the best it's ever been in my life.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.130
My blood pressure is like ridiculously low and good.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.250
So I'm going to keep this healthy living going,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.210
even if I can't get up and walk 20 miles every day.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.330
So you're looking really good right now, Alan.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.770
Yeah, I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.250
I I will tell you, and this is probably is going to be a whole story about

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.890
trail stuff that we'll get some we'll get some leadership and software stuff in there, too.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.480
But I've always known I've done a lot of hundred mile hikes before I did the 2600 mile hike.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.790
And one thing I really figured out is that

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.070
that time like somebody told me this one, so I'll tell a story here.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.190
Said the legs are for walking, the heart is for beating blood, the lungs are for air

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.990
and the brain is for thinking.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.350
And when you're just walking and you let the brain wander and think,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.710
you figure shit out and it's great.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.910
And really got a chance.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.710
I thought about the job stuff a lot, thought about myself a lot.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.550
Yeah, I just the way I put it from the following my sub stack post,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.150
plug here, anger, we will the sub stack dot com.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.070
Go read my stuff, subscribe.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.180
It's free.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.740
And I just stripped away all the BS out of my out of my brain.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.420
So it's like this this Zen.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.220
Oh, I mentioned

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.060
spy is my trail name on the PCT.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.140
I got so used to being called spy when people use my other name,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.820
my government name, it sounds weird.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.820
So I am spy.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.140
And this is a normal occasion that people give themselves trail names.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.780
They don't give yourself a trail name.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.180
Somebody gives you a trail name

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.700
and you can reject it and they may stick or they may not stick.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.980
So spy stuck a wonderful couple.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.380
Yeti and Spout from Philadelphia gave me the trail name spy and it stuck.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.820
And that's who I was.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.420
But somewhere in Oregon, I kind of like the pieces fell into place.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.340
And then I became Zen spy.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.140
So now I'm like, I'm just like doing the Zen thing, doing the spy stuff.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.580
And being called spy is cool because when you bust out of the woods

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.460
someplace after, you know, things you do in the woods off the trail,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.820
somebody says, like, hey, where did you come from?

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.060
I said, doing spy stuff. I can't tell you.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.900
So it's really great. So anyway, it is revealed.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.420
That's what I've been up to.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.540
I've been back.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.820
I've been kind of looking for jobs.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.140
I'm being selective because, like I said, I want to do something that

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.020
I want to do some work that matters.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.180
Work that I care about.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.820
I have enough savings.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.500
I can take my time in doing that.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.380
But I I feel like I do want to work some more someplace and make some things happen.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.500
So I'm going to poke around and see what happens.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.980
I will let it's of course, as you know, it's a weird time of the year

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.260
to looking for jobs, not a little people are hiring in Q4,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.860
but I will keep my eyes open, my ears open, activate the network

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.380
and see what I can find.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.580
So is it as difficult to get an interview

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.820
as for an executive level job as it is for management or programmer

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.460
and that sort of thing?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.220
I I think so.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.500
I don't know because I'm I'm looking for VP level jobs still and

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.500
I've had a recruiter screen so far.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.620
I haven't really ever really applied for that many jobs.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.060
And but it's it's definitely a different.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.270
It's definitely a different

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.340
vibe than it was a couple of years ago.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.140
I've never like here.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.940
Here's this is I don't.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.780
This is not a humble brag or anything, but I've never

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.740
I haven't applied for a job since I started at Microsoft many, many years ago.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.140
It was the worst way to get it.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.180
They talk to me.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.460
They talk to me about a job that I was hired.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.660
Oh, yeah, we need your resume.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.660
So, OK.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.340
And when I went to NBC, again, the recruiter contacted me.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.300
I'm sort of used to having recruiters.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.500
They're just not doing it anymore.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.780
Like I would get a recruiter ping every week like, hey, I'll talk about this.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.060
I say, oh, no, not right now.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.340
Not not the best time.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.100
But there's none of that.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.660
I'm actually doing the legwork myself and actually

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.740
spending time tweaking my resume.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.940
It's weird. It's good. It's fun.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.620
What's not fun, but I'm also.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.180
But also my general routine is I get up in the morning,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.220
I feed the dog, have a little coffee, walk down to the gym, work out,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.380
stop and play pickleball on the way home with the retirees,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.620
come back home, look at a few jobs, apply.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.580
Maybe usually I find like one a day ish, probably on average.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.540
I want to apply to I poke around.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.500
I think about like blog posts or newsletter articles I want to ride.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.620
Right. Do some reading, take another walk with the dog.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.780
It's kind of a good life, but I do.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.140
I am starting to miss working as every day goes by.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.820
So coming along.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.040
So hang out with those.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.300
So good.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.940
But is your privilege in that way that you have like that?

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.020
You can take your time that you can like figure out the stuff

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.100
that can write stuff, get like there might be some some

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.540
the blocks and LinkedIn posts of that that get recruiters to you.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.860
Maybe right. Yeah, maybe.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.900
I hope so. I hope that, you know, my inner hope is that someone

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.740
and I put my sub stack in my resume and it's on LinkedIn.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.490
I would love like I would love to get hired by a place that comes to me.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.850
It's like, hey, I like what you wrote.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.760
I want to see how you apply this to a team like my my H.R.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.280
screen, my recruiter screen last week.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.200
They really had no idea who I was.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.760
It's like, are you still working someplace?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.040
You all know, I was like, man, pay attention to your homework.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.640
Like I did mine. You do yours.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.780
That fair. Am I asking too much?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.060
You're asking more than you're going to get.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.420
Eh, that I don't care.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.420
So I don't know the kind of the kind of stuff that you say that you're best

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.380
and that you want to do should be like the first thing on your CV.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.660
Right. That everybody should be able to like this would be the headline.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.660
Right. I build and gauge teams.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.590
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.550
So hanging out with those pickleball players,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.590
are they trying to draw you into their ranks and join the retirees?

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.470
Oh, no, I'm in there. I'm in their group chat now.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.380
And all they are.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.660
They are. I'm hanging out with them. They are funny.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.780
So they're ruthless.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm getting good enough now where the where some of the retirees will cheat a little

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.780
and I don't care. I'm just there to have fun and get some exercise.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.620
But like it's, you know, it's it's not a bad life.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.140
It's not a bad life.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.340
I just think having some pickleball.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:20.420
Oh, like something's obviously in the go out or just stuff like that.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.590
Like or little things, little things.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.080
I don't care. Or it doesn't matter. I don't care.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.160
I just want to have fun. So I don't care.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.390
So, yeah. So what's what's exciting going on in your world, Danny?

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.270
I actually did hear from a recruiter.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.150
I'm seeing more of that the last several months.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.670
I mean, so not much, but it's a thing that's starting to happen again.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:52.350
So, yeah, I'm I'm still still on the lookout to fill up my schedule more.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.550
I did a tiny bit of consulting with a startup, which was really cool.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.550
And I'd like to do more of that.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.870
I even put it on my LinkedIn because the recruiter said, well,

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.150
if you're doing that thing, why don't I see that thing?

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.950
Well, it wasn't much of a thing, but sure.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:11.190
So, yeah, looking for love to get my consulting going again.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.190
It would be a different kind of consulting than what I did before.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.110
More, you know, developer development focus then then testing exclusively.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.910
But, you know, if a fun full time thing comes along, then I'll consider that too.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.810
Yeah, I must say one thing about that.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.730
I don't hear it's anything of you, Andreas, but what I thought about going

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.970
and doing some consulting myself, I'm kind of tired of paying my own health insurance,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.410
but I guess I can keep doing that.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.810
But I mean, the problem is the people I could help

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.150
probably aren't listening to the podcast.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.110
If you want me to go help your team learn how to deliver with fewer testers

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.710
or or or get rid of dedicated test teams or

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.750
I could I could I've done that so many times I can help you figure that out

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.070
and I could do it in a way that improves velocity and quality.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.870
But those people are not the people listen to the podcast.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.150
Those are the people that hate the podcast on principle.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.390
So I got to work on how to find those people because I could do that.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.620
I could do that.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.260
And I could do that job while going to the gym

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.460
and playing pickleball with retirees and helping them out.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.460
That'd be great. Yeah. So I'll figure that out.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.020
You know, when I was consulting, I got at least half of my business

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.460
from like you were talking about from writing and people just would Google.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.780
I want help.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.060
I want to learn how to do this and this.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.980
And Google would say, oh, here read this thing that Danny wrote.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.340
And then I would get a consulting gig out of it.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.620
But I guess they're they're not googling for podcasts

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.340
or they're not clicking on the podcast link.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.500
So the maybe actually when they're googling,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.220
they're getting an answer now. So I don't know.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.140
Oh, and they're not saying transcripts are like index. Sure.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.620
Why not? Like, sure.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.020
It doesn't say I learned this from Alan and Brent.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.620
So no, it does. And I'll figure it out because it isn't just that that I do.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.340
That's just something I could do that's easy.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.500
I I'm good at organizational change.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.980
If you want to take your team from A to B,

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.620
I'm really good at that.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.900
One thing I struggle with my last job is they wanted to go from A to A.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.740
A was fine. Like, that's fine. Whatever.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.820
But that's not for me.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.340
I don't want to take it from A to A.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.500
Andres, what have you been up to lately? What are you doing?

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.740
Yeah, what just happened?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.140
My boss a bit was like his his patent panic.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.740
Online e-commerce startup thing.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.940
Otherwise, like I've been working as freelancer before.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.020
Basically, the freelance market is like quite dead here in Germany.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.260
Like nothing is happening.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.900
Like the the hourly rates are dropping very hard.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.100
Everybody's scared.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.100
Everybody's like looking for a permanent employment.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.420
Now, I mean, everybody, but I'm maybe on the low key

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.460
looking for a permanent employment somewhere.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.660
But nothing, nothing.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.940
All these people and nobody's working.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.100
Yeah, I don't know.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.780
But at least like when on the full full time employment side of things.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:07.140
At least my skills seem to be at least like still look for looked after.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.100
So yeah, let's see.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.180
Still crazy scary time.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.340
It's a weird time. Yeah.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.620
Off off. I'm not worried yet.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.180
I don't think I'm worried.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.500
I am because I'm not if I was out of money and

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.100
which I'm not yet, I am spending a little bit more than I'd like to of my savings.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.480
I do. I just I really, really want to be selective

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.800
and find a place that I like.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.200
I'm probably not going to work a lot longer.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.760
I do not. I'm not going to work till I'm 65.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.950
I'm not going to pickleball is calling pickleball is calling.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:47.070
But I do I do want to work a little more because I think I'm good at what I do.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.750
And I want to find some places to do it.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.830
But I'm going to I'm not going to go someplace that wants to be a cog in a machine.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.580
I'm better if I can go drive a culture change and take your team from good to

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.860
great or from great to awesome or from awesome to elite.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.020
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.820
I'm going to go find that. I don't know where it is.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.380
I'll figure it out.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.700
So not too worried. That's for a matter.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.780
Why why you have time?

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.340
Like maybe as a suggestion to try to get the transcripts

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.900
indexed somehow.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.860
So if anybody's looking for a culture change and like how to

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.140
deal with that, they find me.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.940
I'm going to see if I can figure out how to do that.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.380
Because the transcripts, I think, should be since all the episodes

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.580
are in Spotify now, they do a little live transcript.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.540
I might be able to figure this out.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.980
Yeah, make it Google a little note.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.140
It'd be interesting.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.300
But I don't know if and here's I don't think I care.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.100
I don't know if I'm a recruiter.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.780
Am I going to Google to find candidates?

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.600
No, I have 10,000 people applying for every single job.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.040
I don't know if I'm going to Google and look for candidates.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.920
I don't know how people I need to think about this some more.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.920
And listeners, all three of you, oh, shit, two are on the episode.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.200
The other listener out there, if

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.920
you want to give me ideas on how to make myself more discoverable, like

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.370
there are I guarantee you, I guarantee you right now, there are half a dozen or more

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.250
companies who need someone exactly like me.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.770
They don't know it yet, or maybe they do.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.410
But if they did, how would they find me?

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.530
That's what I got to figure out.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.210
So anyway, that's my plan.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.970
If I can subject change, I want to and Danny, especially I want to tee this up for you.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:36.920
Uh, the, the modern test, the modern testing principles, which is, we know are not about

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.240
testing and not really that modern.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.600
They're just around software delivery in a world where, um, things are moving very,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.200
very quickly.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.320
These came about historically because Brent and I, Jesus, 10 years ago now,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.980
we're seeing changes happening in delivery that we saw the writing on the wall about

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.140
what was going to happen with test rules.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.020
They were going these at the time, Microsoft probably still had 10,000

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.060
testers when we started the podcast or close to it.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:11.660
And we saw a world where testing could be owned by developers.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:19.930
Uh, data from a customer telemetry could, uh, substitute for a lot of testing and

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:26.770
the ability to get feedback very rapidly daily or up to hundreds of times a day

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.810
meant that those large test teams probably weren't going to exist.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.490
And we were right, uh, which is weird because Brent and I aren't that smart,

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:36.650
but we were right.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.730
We saw the way software was delivered changing and there are people that are

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.610
good at testing who will always be gainfully employed because they can one

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.370
apply that critical thinking and do, and I'm going to come back to critical

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.970
thinking, they can help their teams.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.410
They can either by helping developers do better testing or by, or helping

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.010
people see the big picture or by doing some of that work themselves.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.450
That's always going to exist.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.730
The days of test teams that equal the size of dev teams, focusing as a,

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.340
as a gate to release, they're gone.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.540
I mean, I know they still exist at some companies, but they're basically gone.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.860
Teams aren't delivering that way anymore.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.780
So way back when, uh, I remember I read Ray Dalio's principles and it came up

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.540
to these modern testing principles that again, aren't modern, aren't about

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.260
testing and we've tweaked them a little bit over time, but they're pretty

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.740
much the same.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.060
We're trying to make them apply to the whole team.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.260
We wrote them originally, like here's how testers can think about

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.380
surviving in this new world.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.860
I'm not going to read them all, but one just came up in a LinkedIn discussion

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.940
yesterday, not even a pick on the people that I'm going to tell you where

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.540
to find it, but it's one that's oddly controversial, oddly controversial.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.180
So principle five, we believe that the customer is the only one capable

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:49.070
to judge and evaluate the quality of our product, which I probably, I, I

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.590
gotta, I'm not going to go edit this and get a beep out of here, but,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.330
but this one freaks people that F out.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.100
They go, Oh my God, you're making the customer test our software.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.580
No, we're not.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.740
So Danny, you are one of the experts in the world.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.980
I know of on the writing of Jerry Weinberg.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.910
What is Jerry Weinberg says quality is it's, um, let's see if I can get

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:14.470
the wording right.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.710
Um, value to some person.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:17.830
Did I remember that right?

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.950
You did.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.430
You did.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.990
And then some folks have even added value to some person that matters.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.330
I'm going to ask you both this question.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.730
It's rhetorical, but you could answer it anyway.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:41.220
If I'm building software for a customer who matters the most, the customer.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.500
How about that?

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:49.690
What I don't flip and understand is why people who the same people that

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.450
added the who matters to this.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:56.700
And like, this is a, to me, and I, I just, it just blows my mind.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.180
The people that tout themselves on critical thinking and blah, blah, blah.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.660
And I, I hate to pick on them because I kind of don't care about their world very

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:10.900
much, but when they flip out over, they call this principle irresponsible.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.100
Or whatever.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.140
And then yet in the same breath, they can say quality is

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.580
value to some person that matters.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.620
The tester doesn't matter.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.660
I mean, I'm not saying testers don't matter in this case,

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.460
tester doesn't matter.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.420
Testers do good work and, but it doesn't matter how well you've tested something.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.620
I gave a talk 15 years ago at a conference and said, testers don't care about like

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.780
remember when software shipped in boxes?

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.300
It's maybe it was 20 years ago.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.100
So you don't put it on the side, 90% code coverage, 87% of the

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.540
test passed, blah, blah, blah.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.580
No, they don't care about that.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.460
They care if it solves their problem.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.920
It brings them value because it's offers for them.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.360
They matter and it solved their problem.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.160
The tester certainly can help with all that.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.560
But to say that someone besides the customer is better able to evaluate

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.760
quality, eh, not really true.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.160
So I did want to soapbox that because I saw it last night and I thought about,

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.920
I thought of replying and I do not engage in LinkedIn conversations.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.420
It is not worth the effort because some people on LinkedIn just, I mean,

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:20.820
this is what I hate is when Twitter went away, X, basically Twitter went away.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.250
And for me, it started bringing all of their BS conversations to LinkedIn.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.450
And I'm not here for it.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.380
It's gross.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.260
Now I have to go to LinkedIn and see if there's any jobs available, but I'm

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.540
actually finding all the good jobs are on indeed and elsewhere.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.020
So I kind of stay away from LinkedIn, but I went there last night.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:37.700
I was bored.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.000
I was weak and I fell into a trap thoughts.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.580
I find good stuff on LinkedIn.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.860
I avoid the nonsense.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:45.940
I don't know about you.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.620
How do you avoid the nonsense?

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.460
Is there a nonsense filter I'm missing?

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.980
Well, I mean you, you sense that it's nonsense.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.860
And then you scroll.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.740
Oh, the, um, as soon as you start scrolling, you're lost though.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.140
Right.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.480
Uh, you know, I do make a point of who posted this because I might have to come

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.120
back to their profile and find it again.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.440
So yeah, there there's that.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.930
Do I, do I mark where they work and mark it as a company I should never ever work at?

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.250
I mean, what do I, what do I do?

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.650
How do I like it is?

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.210
It's bad.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.170
You just, I don't know.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.330
I don't really have a good answer.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.570
If it's one of your connections and you really don't like what they said,

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.450
then they need to not be a connection anymore.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:27.930
I suppose.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.130
Yeah.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.970
I actually did that once a few weeks ago.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.810
I went and un unconnected a whole bunch of people who were showing up in my feed

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.610
and just pissing me off.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.650
I need to do more of that, but I'm going to ask you this.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.970
If I do that, am I just creating an echo chamber?

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.430
Do I want to heal it?

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.430
Sending opinions.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.350
So is an echo chamber bad?

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.830
Yes.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.020
What do I do then?

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.140
Help me solve my problem.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.680
I see, uh, learning is gesturing.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.240
Uh, sounds like you need to unmute.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.080
It depends, right?

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.600
Like an echo.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.560
You want to set healthy boundaries, right?

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.680
Nobody is saying no to healthy boundaries.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.880
Um, though, if that's just the bubble, you can't escape off.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.960
It's a different question.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.160
I don't know.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.240
I, I'm really not that worried about it, but I, I feel like I should be on

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.000
LinkedIn to kind of keep my eye on jobs, but I'm also not finding very many good

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.560
jobs there.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.120
I like it when it gives me, uh, this is the thing I love about LinkedIn.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.440
Here's a job.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.960
When I click on the job, it says you're not a good fit for this job.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.560
So why'd you even show it to me?

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.320
God, you should see some of the ones that says I'm a great fit for no LinkedIn.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.320
Oh yeah.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.680
I've seen, I've seen those too.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.320
They've been wrong.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.240
They've been wrong.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:38.640
All right.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.880
Here's the thing to look for.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.040
You want people with a different opinion than you have who is willing to have a

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.840
rational discussion about it.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.720
That's the difference.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.440
Yes.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.480
Yes.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:55.000
How I, I wish I like on dating apps, they have like this match thing.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.880
I need to know, even if I disagree, I want to know I can have a rational

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.520
discussion with you.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.880
How do I, I guess I have to, I guess I have to filter that out.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.280
I don't, it's, it's blah.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.200
Yeah.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.400
There's even someone that we all like to talk trash about that if you have a

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.080
private conversation with them, um, it's, it's a rational conversation.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.120
Yes.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.320
And I've, I've, I have experienced exactly that.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.160
But I've, but I've told you that LinkedIn is just bait.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.960
It is just, just picking principle five and dumping.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.400
It didn't used to be that way.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.440
I think it was.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:30.960
Okay.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.600
Maybe, maybe I just spent more time on LinkedIn because Twitter went away and I

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.720
used to spend time on Twitter.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.520
I think my account still exists.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:43.070
I haven't launched Twitter X, whatever it's called in definitely not shitter.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.830
The X I haven't, I haven't been on that platform in forever.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.910
Uh, I had to join Facebook last summer.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.120
And I have no friends on Facebook because that's the trail angels who are, we'll

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.080
talk about them in a second here.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.600
Uh, they, that's the way to communicate with him is on Facebook.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.080
So I created a Facebook account.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.080
They made me put a picture on there to prove I was real, but I have no friends.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.840
I just, and I've left all the groups I was in.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.240
I just needed to delete my account.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.520
I deleted my original account for way back when years ago, but I

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.320
created a new one, no friends.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.840
I know I obviously don't spend time there.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.480
Uh, I posted on Instagram about my hike this summer.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:30.320
So I scroll there sometimes, but I, I've kind of, it's weird.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.720
And maybe it's just cause I was remote for, I was off the grid for so long.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.170
Social media in general, including LinkedIn.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:38.810
Like I can't scroll.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.930
I can scroll like two screens.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:40.470
I said, that's enough.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.810
I'm done.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.740
I am.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.280
I've, it's weird though.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.660
I used to love, I used to be able to watch tick tock for like a half hour

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.020
straight and now some people do longer half hours.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.260
That's a long time for me.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.780
I can't even binge stuff on Netflix.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.260
I just can't sit that long and I couldn't before I especially can't now.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.650
I just have no patience for it.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:08.380
So instead I, I take long walks and I, uh, fell into a good, a good, uh, I'm

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.380
in a good pace.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.460
I didn't think I'd be able to write every week when I got back.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.860
Cause I couldn't write every week before I left.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.300
I was fried, but I can now.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.100
Nice.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.580
Go, go read.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.140
Anyway.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.140
Yeah.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.220
So enough, enough input to it, like write for a time.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.340
Like the best thing about like having this kind of job is getting

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.500
more input to write about.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.530
No, what's interesting is vast majority of my newsletters have been

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:35.850
related to something happening at work.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.010
Something comes up.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:37.930
You know what I'm going to write.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.490
I could help one of the ways I process.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.370
I process a lot just by talking through things, but if I can write about it,

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.130
I can figure out what it means to me.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:54.640
And you'll notice a lot of my, uh, posts recently, I've just been about like

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.440
things from the trail that are kind of retrospecting into my life.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.040
Like, oh, this made me think about this thing or this thing on trail.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.160
I'm going to think about this thing or this thing.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.400
I'm going to think about this thing on the trail.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.110
So, um, eventually and probably not very quickly, I'll run out of some of

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.910
those ideas and by then I'll probably have a job.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.190
So I guess I'll find some there.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:19.420
Can I circle back to principle number five really quick because I don't like it.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.860
This is the way this podcast goes.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.660
Even with Brent, we just go in circles and circles and circles.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.340
Tell me what you don't like.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.860
Well, you're supposed to be a good listener, which means you lose your train

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.980
of thought, but then it comes back.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.460
So I'm working on being a better listener.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.380
Okay.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:36.340
So I believe the customer is the best person to judge and evaluate

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.940
the quality of your product, but is often not the only one doing that.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.580
And I think that's why so many people don't like that statement.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.140
It's, it's a bit of a hyperbole.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.620
And unless you're doing like, uh, production monitoring is your only testing.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.620
There are other opinions that matter.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.990
Aren't there?

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.030
And it seems, and it seems, and it seems easily to dispute, right?

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.630
The customer is the only one capable.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.310
No, it isn't like multiple people capable really, but maybe it's the one.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.070
How, how are they?

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.350
And, and some might not, but when you say like about security, how

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.470
as a customer do I know that the security aspects of the software are

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:20.030
really like as presented, I cannot really, but this doesn't mean the

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.150
whole thing is irresponsible.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.070
It's the principle.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.110
It's how you, how you deal with it.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.430
Right.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.870
It's

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.830
I'm going to let me push back on that.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.190
I'm not against this and we can have, I'm glad people have a rational conversation,

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:37.860
but who else give me, give me another person, give me another persona that

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.020
can evaluate the quality of our product.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.060
I guess as like, as like, maybe not a main expert, but expert

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.980
tester, I could find the things that the customer only glancing.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.660
How do they know that the customer, how do they know that the customer

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.660
would care about that issue?

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.500
I, I don't know.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.180
I'm going to have a soapbox for a second here because some of these folks will

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.710
find, I'm going to air quote bugs that no customer would ever care about.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.990
They're very excited about those testers.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.590
Lots of testers get really excited about, Oh, I found this thing.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.110
And, and something Brent said a long time ago is what's, what

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.750
is higher quality software?

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:15.110
A software where software where there are no known bugs, but has a hundred users

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:19.910
or software that has dozens of bugs, but used by tens of thousands of users.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.190
Which one brings more value?

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.110
It's the second one.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.190
So how do we know that the expert tester is finding bugs

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.510
that matter to the customer?

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.620
Some of them are obvious.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.900
It crashes every time you started up in every environment.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.740
You don't need to ask the customer, is that bad?

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.540
Should we fix it?

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.650
I got the sense customer wouldn't see that right.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.010
And, and, and if he wrote the customer would definitely say, yeah, this is shit.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.730
I don't want that.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.070
Yeah.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.990
Well to me and Eric Reese, Eric Reese, Lian startup.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.830
You don't get any value from your engineering effort until

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.830
it's in the hands of customers.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.790
You don't know if you've built the right thing to solve their problem.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.940
Obviously.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.000
And, and we can separate testing from quality.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.680
I don't really give a shit about testing anymore.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.400
I care about quality.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.630
Testing has to happen, but it's on the pursuit of quality, which is value

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.510
to some person who matters, which I think is the customer.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:24.140
So if we put it that way, uh, yeah, we're, we're going, if we just are careless.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.900
And I'm going to refer once again to Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.500
Uh, I'll tell a story about that in a second.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.900
Uh, Robert Piercig basically says quality and care are two sides of the same coin.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.620
So we're going to put care as a developed development team into our

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.730
software. Uh, so it doesn't mean we're, we're evaluating quality.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.850
We're going to put care into what we make and craftsmanship into what we make,

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.290
but we don't know if it's quality, meaning value to some person

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.410
until the customer use it.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.050
Right.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.450
All you know is that it solves some problem you think.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:58.840
Yeah.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.980
You have a hypothesis that it solves the problem.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.340
So then you can put metrics in telemetry in place to see, are we solving

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.740
the problem we're intending to solve with this software, with this

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.100
release with this API, whatever.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.870
But the customer, we don't know if it solves that problem until the customer

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.310
uses it.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.870
And when you say the quality of our product in that principle,

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.870
people aren't thinking the quality product is the one that solves the actual

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.230
problem instead of a different problem.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.270
I think they're not even thinking about that at all.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.390
The way that's written.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:34.190
How would you, well, I've been pushing back on the, the only one,

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.870
because I do believe the customer, I still believe the customer.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.950
Ultimately, the, I mean, there's other quality things that can happen,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.430
but I'm, I'm bending a little bit, but I'm not bending.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.750
Cause it doesn't matter if it doesn't solve the problem for the customer.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.520
But how would you, how would you, other than saying the best,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.520
which I don't think I like, I'm going to think about it though.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.360
How would you write that principle?

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.580
It's the most important one to judge and evaluate.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:03.790
I don't know.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.180
I'm going to think about it.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.860
And I would make maybe, maybe at a yes.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:14.980
And, um, like as we like enable, make our teams more capable.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:21.620
Our goal could be to make the customers more capable of like, actually deciding if

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.460
this is like solving the problem in a good way or not, or like helping them

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.260
understand the quality of the product for their needs or whatever.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.700
Um, so it's not irresponsible because we don't just push it to the customer

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.020
without any, like without any care, without any quality and without any

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.980
feedback, right?

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.060
We just, we usually it's good for quality.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.620
If we work close to the customer, get an interaction feedback loop and they,

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.980
they judge what we deliver.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.460
I get that.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:45.740
Yeah.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:46.740
Yeah.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.420
The feedback loops become critical there.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.500
If you can have a super fast feedback loop.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.900
Um, I think what pushes people's buttons here, and this is probably

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.410
partially on purpose is that people read this principle and think, Oh, you're

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:05.410
making the customers test our software, which is true, but not true in the

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:09.090
sense of like, here's your test cases, go enter these bug reports, blah, blah,

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:09.450
blah.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.130
We have telemetry in place to help us understand how it's being used, what

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.810
problems are being solved, what errors running into, we're looking into

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:16.970
HTTP error logs.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.450
We have a lot of stuff we monitor to see if it's working as designed

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.170
functional correctness and to see if it's solving that problem.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.690
Uh, Brent and I have talked quite a bit about, um, having a hypothesis

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.010
for every feature, like we expect that adding this feature will increase,

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.890
uh, user acquisition by 20%.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.040
And before even releasing it, talking about the experiment, everyone

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.640
think about what are we going to do?

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.880
If it does, what are we going to do?

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.400
If it doesn't do we double down?

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.480
Do we try something different?

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.160
Making every feature hypothesis on what's going to change for the customer.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:48.960
So you can measure that.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.240
You can tell if you're solving a new problem, if it's getting better

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.560
for the customer or something is changing, it's a lot of extra work.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.960
Uh, developers, development teams often fall into, wouldn't it be cool

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.520
if we did this thing and they, and Microsoft is especially horrible at this.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.720
And I can tell you many stories from my time there.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.880
And, uh, I can, I cannot stand Microsoft products anymore, but it was, it was

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.000
just as bad when I was there.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:19.200
Uh, so how do we make sure we're solving a real customer problem and not

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.080
something that we think is cool or something we think will solve a customer

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.880
problem, how do you do that about the customer?

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.200
I'm seeing faces.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.220
Yeah.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:31.740
Dog fooding.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.660
I'm going to first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.620
dog fooding, but then you are your own customer.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.500
Basically that doesn't help really.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.400
Yeah.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.560
And where you can dog food, if you can use your software to

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.840
help make your software always awesome.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.720
I, you know, I've done that a ton at Microsoft, but working

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.960
on operating systems, especially.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:49.960
It's a great way.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:58.240
Cause it's a, uh, it's a proxy, but we're not the customer.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.200
I think it'd be an example from office way back.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.440
It's like office 97, I think a lot.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.980
And this is back in the years of three year ship cycles and lots

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.830
and lots of beta testers, lots of feedback, fixed the bugs, better

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.030
testers, all super happy.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:15.450
They ship it.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:21.950
A bunch of customers are pissed off because I think it was, um, I

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.270
think it was, I don't remember exactly.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.910
I think it was lawyers, lawyers use, they didn't have enough

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:28.910
lawyers in the beta testing lawyers use word differently than way.

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.950
Everybody else uses word and they were pissed off because

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:31.870
bunches that didn't work right.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.710
So it, and it's the same thing if you do your own testing.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.800
Because your dog fooding is great.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.680
You're finding a lot of the stuff.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.560
It's how I use it.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.960
You don't use it like the customer because the customer will

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.080
use your software differently.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.600
You need to think about all the different aspects.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.920
And when you're dealing with a million customers, data telemetry.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.360
So the way you can really do that rather than wait, rather than ship it,

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.080
wait for bug reports to come in and then ship patches.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:55.840
Gross.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:57.530
Thank thank goodness.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.130
We can, we can ship multiple times a day now and detect these things

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.170
and fix these things and, and figure this stuff out.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.660
Last product I worked on was installed at the customer controlled

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.020
environments and that was, that was weird.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.780
We didn't ship multiple times a day and it, it, it definitely

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.980
felt like a step back, but that, that still happens out there.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.020
Yeah, it does.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.540
It does.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:27.340
And, and again, I think some of the folks who get angry over any of

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.740
these principles, especially five, which we did not expect expect to

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.140
be the most controversial, but I think it is.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.500
All of our years consistency.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.220
It's amazing.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:37.150
Yeah.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:44.830
Um, I think there is a lot of software that is still shipping yearly.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.660
I don't, I don't ever want to work on that stuff.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.540
I like, it is so much fun ship working on stuff that ships multiple times a day.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:00.100
I love detecting and fixing errors automatically within minutes.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.390
Uh, I, it's, it's more exciting for me.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.870
Yeah.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:08.510
So as you do that, we had the podcast reading my posts recruiters.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.870
Yeah.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.310
Yeah.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.670
And then when, when Brian Finster was on, we talked about, and he said this a lot

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.230
and he's very active on LinkedIn as well.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.310
I like reading his posts because he's not afraid to engage with people on LinkedIn.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.630
Uh, but Brian said, like the best way to find problems in your team is to

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.710
try and do continuous deployment.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.000
Like if I go to, oh, we can't do that because that, okay, we'll fix that.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.060
We still couldn't do it because of, of B we'll go fix B it's, uh, whether

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.980
you do continuous deployment or not.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.380
Does it matter?

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.060
You don't have to, but if you talk about what it would take to do it, you're

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.340
going to find all the bottlenecks and problems in your system.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:45.600
Yeah.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.150
Cool.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:49.580
All right.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.460
What else we talk about?

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.020
Do I want to talk about that some more?

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.620
I can talk all day, as you can tell.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.780
Well, there was just a recent Dora report was coming out, right?

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:04.020
Saying like fewer than once per six months, deployment frequency is at 3.6%

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.780
they say here, so based on the,

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.180
if you're a recruiter, one of those companies, please do not contact me.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.220
That's the folks that need you most.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.390
I thought maybe I got to think about this.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:22.990
I kind of, so bringing a team from every six months to, well, there's

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:27.030
stories about this, like, I think Flickr was the one that went from like a very

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.070
slow release from multiple times a day.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:34.190
First, I guess I could, I don't know if that was their desire, if the

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.630
desire, there's the difference.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.270
I figured it out.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.670
If it is, I don't want to go from A to A.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.870
If shipping every six months or less is, that's the plan.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.350
That's the forever plan.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.630
Hard pass.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.750
But yeah, if you want to get, if you're shipping once every six months

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.110
and you want to ship 10 times a day, hell yeah.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.190
Let's go do that.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.100
I mean, I'm still, I'm trying to figure out my testing past is calling me and

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:03.420
I've kind of stepped away from it completely, but every time I, I talk to

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.860
somebody about that topic, like my Spidey senses say, Oh yeah, this is, this is

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.780
cool, get into this.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:10.500
Uh huh.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:15.700
You know, I'm not going to go do a testing specialist job again, but I really

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.260
should tap into that experience.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:23.540
So, uh, yeah, if I could get, uh, your, your leftovers, Alan, for

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.100
transforming an organization or something, I don't know, but I really need to

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:32.460
embrace that and, and help, uh, help companies bridge that gap.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.700
Well, wherever they are in that journey.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.060
Yeah.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.140
But if they're not on a journey, if they're going A to A, yeah.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:38.620
Yeah.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.820
Uh, I'm not going to be a cog in the wheel.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:43.880
Exactly.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.600
Same exact boat.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.080
I can't, I can't do that again.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.520
I'm, you know, as I think my LinkedIn profile says this, but

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.120
Brent calls me a change agent.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.560
And I, I like, I'm good at helping organizations make changes and figure

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.000
out and finding all the things blocking them from doing it.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.800
I, I don't want to go from A to A.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.720
I don't want to hold the status quo.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.200
I don't want to be, you know, you get it.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.360
So, um, the good news is, is I will find a job eventually.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.320
And I know where all the really talented yet unemployed people are.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.120
So I, and I will have open headcount.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.320
So I'll just, I'll just bring y'all along for the ride.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.520
Awesome.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.280
So the jobs you're looking for, Alan, they don't have a

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.880
thousand people applying for them.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.280
Do they?

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.380
No, they don't, but a couple, a hundred, 200 sometimes.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.820
No, they don't have a hundred people applying for them.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.380
Not the job that you really need.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.980
Um, and it's probably not posted on LinkedIn either.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.980
And I can almost guarantee the job I find won't be on a job board.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.420
It'll come from a network somewhere.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.500
Exactly.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:44.860
Yeah.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.100
That's, that's really most likely how it's going to happen.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:47.940
Yeah.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.340
I knew that I see where you're going now, but yeah, I'm, I'm going to

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:56.200
apply because I need to shake the rest off and I'm on an advisory, um, advisory

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.100
board for a couple of different tech companies that kind of, that's fun.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.820
It's free consulting.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.460
I have the people reach out for more free consulting.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.260
Um, I'm happy to do that because it kind of tickles my tech

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.860
brain and gets my brain working again.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.500
Uh, I became pretty dumb on the trail.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.060
I forgot everything.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:14.930
It's coming back.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.970
So then back, it's cause all you do is you get up and you walk and you eat

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.850
and you shit in the woods and, and

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.970
now you get to build that knowledge back up with a better structure than before.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.840
It is an a clear brain.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.640
Uh, I'm super excited because I'm, I know what I'm good at.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:43.310
I know I can do all the things I do, but, uh, what Zen spy is, is, uh, there's

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.950
all this, it kind of kind of built a lot of the therapy I've been on,

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.670
been in for years and years, but there's a buzz that happens.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.070
Like just things you're worried about stressors, anxiety, little things.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.470
They're all gone.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.700
They went away.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.300
I mean, they went, they still come back once in a while, but when they're gone,

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.620
you can tell it's like, if you're in a room and you think it's silent, then

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.100
you turn the lights off and this buzz you didn't even notice goes away.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.500
That's what happened in my head.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.300
And now I can hear when it comes back.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.180
Oh, that's wrong.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.500
Whereas I gotta make that go away and I can make it go away usually pretty

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:18.820
quickly.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.910
So I'm trying to stay in this world where, uh, I'm happy.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.830
I'm confident.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.390
I'm clear on what I want to do.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:32.030
And I'm not going to do things that take me away from that, which would be

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.990
a company that wants to go from a and stay at a forever.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:41.790
Uh, I am at my most effective when I can be me and push things forward and do

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.910
all the wild, crazy things I do while creating engaged teams at kick ass.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.270
So that's, that's my plan.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:53.150
Um, uh, Zen spy incorporated, maybe, I don't know, Zen spy LLC.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.470
I'm not sure what it's going to look like.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:55.710
But we'll figure it out.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:00.910
One little networking tip that I'm finding is, um, it's not necessarily your

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.390
really deep connections.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:07.870
Uh, it's very frequently someone that you you've met maybe twice virtually.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:11.470
Um, those are the ones that are usually getting me interviews.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:15.950
So it's those fresh connections, oddly enough are really valuable.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.040
I'm going to keep an eye on that.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:22.800
I haven't really leveraged my network enough yet on this job search.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.480
And again, cause it's a weird time.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.840
I'll, I'll, I'll reach out to him.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:32.450
I was, uh, one point I was planning to head down to San Francisco for a bit later

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.330
this year, I thought I would network a bunch of my old unity colleagues, uh,

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.330
who are both there and not there anymore.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.770
Uh, not just been pushed out a little bit, but I can still contact them virtually.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:46.690
I have one good thing about unity's massive layoffs is I have former team

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:50.210
members who like me a lot who are spread all over the tech industry.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:56.410
So, uh, I will, I will begin reaching out to them and see what to have them

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:57.450
keep an ear out for me.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.940
Uh, I've done that a little bit already.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:05.390
I'll do some more of that, but, uh, yeah, we'll see what I'm not again, not

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.430
super worried about it yet.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.790
Um, I can even probably leave the yet off there.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:09.790
I'm not super worried about it.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:14.310
Cause I know that I will find a job eventually and I'm not going to settle

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.990
for something like, Oh, here's a job.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.990
I'm not going to go work for.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.890
Oh, meta, for example.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.090
Never going to happen.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.870
Never going to happen.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.030
Not a fan.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.520
Uh, I kind of don't want to work at a super big company again.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.000
I think for me, I would love it.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:38.880
If I could own engineering in a company had like between 200 and 800 or a thousand

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:44.540
engineers, um, I guess my sweet spot for, for culture change and pushing things

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.140
along and not being in a cognitive machine, but having the ability to

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.420
change culture and drive things.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.740
But we'll again, we're going to see what happens.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.820
I'm repeating myself, but I think it sounds exactly like the thing that

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.660
everybody's telling like freelancers to do, please put it online, put it on

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.980
your service page, what kind of packages do we offer?

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.180
What kind of shops do you seek?

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.540
Um, just get it, get it online.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.820
Somehow that will probably help maybe of like random people stumbling upon

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.260
that, right?

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:14.340
Just by you say the organizations that might need you hate you or whatever.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:19.620
Um, maybe not the person who are like, who wants to take care and

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.420
wants to make quality matter might be looking, might stumble just by

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.500
Googling upon sub-stack course or whatever.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:27.780
Right.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.780
We need to start a Slack channel called help Alan help spy find a job.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.300
Spy job.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:40.320
You can all give me your tips on cause I'm, uh, you know, the newsletters are

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.080
on angry weasel.substack.com.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.280
I still have angry weasel.com, uh, five for Friday, which I did for

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.600
like three years straight, maybe four.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.880
Uh, uh, I'm, I think I'm going to be done with those.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.160
Oh, wow.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.500
So I don't think so.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.580
I've, I've, I've sort of lost momentum towards the end.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.020
I got, I did him every week, but I got to say it was a highlight of my week

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.100
when I showed up in one of them.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.260
Like, oh, now maybe I have to do them again.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.500
I, I am not on the internet that much.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:16.140
Maybe when I get back to reading, uh, I'm reading, maybe I'm reading

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.780
books instead of internet things.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.100
Maybe when I get back into the swing of things a little more, that,

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:20.940
that'll come back.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:25.060
But then where the question I was getting to is where do I put this

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.220
information on angry weasel.com?

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.660
It's not on a separate page.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.220
I put it on the sub stack somewhere.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:35.620
I got to figure, I got to figure out what information I want to share where I

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.900
put it and how I get people to find it.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:41.500
So my, my network, and again, this, this is a fresh contact introduced me to one

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.260
person who introduced me to somebody they knew who gave me an opportunity

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:50.540
with her network to be listed as a service provider among startups.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.740
And I'm looking at this form that I fill out to get on this, this list.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.060
And it asks, what do you do?

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.700
And I, well, I do a lot of things.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:03.340
I don't know what to put there because it's got to sound organized and focused,

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.260
but it's tough being a generalist.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:06.780
Damn it.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:10.980
I think so.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.980
Um, I think I can get pretty specific at what I do.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:19.220
Uh, and again, maybe starting off at a consultant role or a fractional CTO

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.620
fractional VPE is a better path for me.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.500
I haven't, I'm kind of six to one half of those together right now.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.340
I'm my post.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.120
I've always thought I do consulting at some point in my career, whether it's

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:38.190
now and then into full time, whether they do full time and do some, I, even

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.230
when I stopped working, um, I can't just go to the gym, play pick a ball

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.270
every day, I'll get a little bored.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.510
I need to exercise my brain.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.630
So let's say I get a job I love.

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:46.790
I do it for a couple of years.

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.750
Um, and I tend to not just quit jobs.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.110
I can, I, I quit when I'm not needed anymore.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.910
I've worked myself out of almost every job I've been in, except for the last

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:57.630
one where I hiked myself out of it.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.990
And I will probably do that again.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:04.430
I will find myself, um, in a position where I don't need to be there at

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:05.790
that point, I'll probably go into consulting.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.910
I'm not, I'm not going to do full time work for a lot longer.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:15.820
Uh, I like it, but I also like traveling and hiking and, uh, playing pick

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.460
a ball with the, with the retirees.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:22.180
And, and I guess technically I'd be a retiree, but I don't know.

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.860
I'm I'm I'm a, I'll just say I'm a lot younger than the folks I'm

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.700
playing pick a ball with.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:26.620
Yeah.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:27.820
I look back over this period.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.540
I've been unemployed and thought, man, if I had known out all of that,

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.940
all those efforts to find a job wouldn't have succeeded.

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.700
I would have traveled and I thought, wait, traveling costs money.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.100
Dang it.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.100
It does.

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.900
Well, it, it, yeah, it does.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:46.180
It, it, it, it's not free for sure, but there are cheaper places to travel

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.140
and, um, you can, you can make it work.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.500
So yeah, then I'll, I don't know.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:51.900
I'll figure it out.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.220
That was good talking about that though.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.820
And you guys, you know, we'll start some, uh, some slack conversations.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.300
You go to modern testing.org and get a link to our slack group.

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.060
One of the three.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.260
And if you want to help me, I'll create a channel, help, you know, spy

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.340
jobs and you can all give me tips on how to find the job I'm looking for.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:12.920
But really, I need, I haven't tried that hard yet, so I'm not terribly

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.480
worried about it.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.840
I'd hire you as a consultant in an instant.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.240
So, well, I guess that's what I need somebody who actually has, um,

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.320
pocketbooks to tell me.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.240
Yeah.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.120
You can't leave us today without getting a story.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.360
How much can you afford?

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.960
I'll let you know when I get the job and the budget.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.120
So help me get a job too.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.760
Yeah.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.160
But yeah, it's fun though.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.800
Alan, you have to tell us, you have to tell us a trail story before you go.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.960
You're, I know you're trying to wrap up.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.160
We have to hear a juicy trail story.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:50.660
Well, which I there's, there's like 10,000.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.860
It's like when people ask, how was the hike?

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.620
It was four and a half months and I walked 2,655 miles, not including side trips.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.660
We'll call it 3000.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.460
How was it?

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.900
Uh, that's not what I'm asking.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.220
How was like 10 minutes of that hike?

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.900
That was really exciting.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:13.470
Um, let me, it's all exciting in its own way.

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:16.270
So let me just kind of, I'll give you the overview and then listeners.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.550
If you want to ask, if you want me to dive into any of this, let me know.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:20.350
This might take a while.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:26.270
Uh, the Pacific rest trails is, uh, in five sections.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:27.430
So I'll go one by one.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:33.420
The desert starts at the Mexican border goes up to, uh, roughly where

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.300
the Sierra began in California.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.220
So South of just South of the Bay area.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.740
Uh, blew my mind how beautiful the sunsets were.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.780
I had never seen a desert sunset before.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.100
I never say I don't think I've seen a cactus bloom before.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.260
So I spent, you know, a solid month and a half walking through the desert.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.750
Just, I thought I would hate it.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:52.430
It was beautiful.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:53.230
It was incredible.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.710
A great way to not, not huge Hill thought it was great.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.530
Uh, hit the Sierra on may 31st.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:03.970
Um, and still a lot of snow, a lot of snow.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.920
Uh, I did probably some, some of my dumbest hiking.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.560
I was hiking by myself through the, there's people around.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:17.220
I didn't hike with people and probably the dumbest thing I did.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.740
And this is, I wrote about this in one of my recent newsletters is I decided

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.620
I was going to go say down this Hill, which ended up being solid ice.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.900
It was a dumb, dumb choice.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.340
Um, somebody broke their leg there the day before.

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.420
I didn't know that, uh, I managed to, I know what I'm doing.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.340
Instincts took over.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.060
I bailed out.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.060
I was fine.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.980
Uh, but I spent the rest of the day thinking about how

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.420
stupid I was to even try that.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:44.140
So, you know, a week later I am walking across this waste, deep rapids

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.540
by myself also, also stupid.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.900
But, um, I had one choice.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:53.340
One is to either keep going and make it across, which was choice

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.060
a or choice B, which was die.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:01.700
So I chose a, which was good, but you know, probably having a spotter there to call.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.460
I'm not sure what the spotter would have done because I'd

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.820
have been washed down the river.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:09.660
They could have called the SOS and got me dragged out downstream.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:09.980
I don't know.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:17.820
Um, but overall fun, a lot of, uh, I mean, incredible beauty, but walking in snow

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:22.740
every day, almost all day for a month was a little, little tiring after a while.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.060
You get, you get to the Sierra and you go, Oh my God, the waterfalls are so

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:26.460
beautiful.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.660
The mountain lakes are so great.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.300
Three weeks later you go, Oh great.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.180
Another lake, another waterfall, more snow.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:38.510
Uh, Northern California starts around, um, Tahoe up to the Oregon border.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:44.060
Uh, the worst maintained part of trailer hiking over, it was hot.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:47.740
It was ashy from, from major forest fires there in the past.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:55.140
And, uh, that's where I, that's where Zen Spy was born because I got so deep

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.580
into my head, did not think about how miserable the trail was that like,

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.900
all I solved every single problem.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.460
I didn't even know I had yet in my head.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.820
Um, and then I got to Oregon, took a bunch of days off in Ashland to see some plays.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.020
Uh, and then started trekking through Oregon.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.860
I smashed my ankle on my first day out of Ashland.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:20.300
So about 15 miles into Oregon, a long story, a rock flipped up and bashed

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.860
my ankle, it's still not right yet.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.700
Uh, I woke up the next morning, ankle was swollen.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.100
So I did what any through Hiker does.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.780
I only walked 15 miles that day.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:30.630
Elevated my leg.

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:33.430
I woke up next morning, it was a little better.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:35.070
So I only walked 15 miles again.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:38.470
And then, uh, it kept on getting a little bit.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:39.510
I did 22 the next day.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:44.350
I ended up doing my biggest day at all in Oregon hike 33 miles, uh, one day, but

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:48.870
basically went across Oregon in about 20 days, Oregon's a little flatter,

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:51.070
cruised across my ankle healed as I walked on it.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.430
Uh, it's still not healed.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.590
I had it looked at once said, come back.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.430
It doesn't get better if you're not walking on it so much.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.310
I had to go back because even today, just, I went for a little run.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.150
It's like, it's tweaked.

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:03.390
It's screwed up, but Oregon was a blast.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:12.050
Um, uh, met, um, ended up, uh, met another Hiker and Crater Lake who ended up, we

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.690
ended up hiking in the last whole last 800 miles of the trail together.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.770
Incredible persons, still good friends today.

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:22.630
Uh, hit Washington and it's like, Oh my God, I'm home, but it's so far.

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.590
Washington is so much harder than Oregon.

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.470
The ups and downs are so much.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:34.540
Uh, but cruise along, uh, my son who we called spike it, uh, is 21 years old,

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:38.940
hiked from so quality past to Stevens, past with us, just 70 miles stretch,

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.060
but more up and down per miles than anywhere else on the trail.

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.220
I think he was a little beat up, uh, a little, a little complaining towards

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:49.020
the end, but he made it through, pushed him pretty hard and then, uh,

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.280
pushed all the way to the border.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.920
And it was a little, that was a little surreal getting to the finishing.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.020
Cause you're just walking every day and all of a sudden you're done, but you're

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.820
not totally done because you have to turn around and walk 30 miles backward to get

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.020
home because you can't walk into Canada anymore because stuff.

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:11.850
And then it didn't really sit in that I was done.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.610
Um, it's hard to handle.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.650
It is.

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:19.730
And I'll tell you coming back was there is a real thing called post trail

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:24.570
depression, which, um, still comes and goes, but the first week back was

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:25.210
overwhelming.

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:28.170
I went four and a half months where everything I needed to live fit in a

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:33.020
backpack, a small backpack, even if I stayed in a hotel for the night, all my

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.540
stuff still fit into a backpack.

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:39.190
And then I come home and there's just all this stuff everywhere.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:43.520
And I didn't know what to do with it.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.640
I get, I purged a lot of it.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.120
I have more to get rid of.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.920
I can't handle having stuff.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:56.290
Like even I have like lots of books on testing and leadership and

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:58.970
software development, most of them on leadership.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.010
I don't want them anymore.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:08.810
Um, I'm like, I, I going to, I, if I knew someone locally who wanted the books,

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.450
I just like, if anybody's in the Seattle area, you want a bunch of books on

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:12.970
leadership, let me know.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.050
I'll give them all to you.

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:15.530
I'm a sucker for books.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.210
That's the hardest thing for me to get rid of.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.010
As you can see, I don't want them.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:20.410
I don't want things.

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.210
I don't want my things anymore.

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:24.970
I got a lot of my clothes don't fit anymore because I lost about

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.130
25 pounds on the trail.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.810
It's like, but I didn't like him anymore.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.170
I got rid of a bunch of my clothes.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.410
I got rid of a bunch of, um, just stuff.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:36.530
I continue to purge every day, either throwing stuff away or like I have

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:38.450
no desire at all to have collection.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:41.210
I don't have any big collections, but I just don't want things.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:46.740
So that's, that's a little, uh, one thing that really hit home.

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:50.380
And, um, even some, you hear this a lot of times in self-help or

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.630
retirement books is you want to have experiences, not things.

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.750
And that's become like super true for me since I've been back.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:00.190
I don't, I don't give a crap about things.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:02.510
I want to have experiences.

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:08.150
Like I got a note from the, uh, or a friend of mine from trail sent me a note

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:12.150
saying I can get a completion certificate for the PCT and I made a digital one.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.870
I'm printed as a thing.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:14.470
You guys can see it looks like that.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:18.270
So, but I'll probably just put this in a look at this, put it in the recycle

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.030
bin, cause I don't want it.

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:20.710
I had the experience of hacking the PCT.

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.570
My internet's a little freaky.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:25.290
It'll work out fine.

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:27.090
I had the experience of liking the PCT.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.450
I don't need a thing about it.

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:38.940
Uh, I want to spend my money on travel and, uh, classes or things I can learn and do.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:45.480
I really don't want to buy cars or books or, I mean, I'll read books on my Kindle.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.200
Um, they're small, but I don't, yeah, I think it's probably pretty common, but

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:54.040
it's, it's weird, it's weird being back, but I'm back now and, um, I will

00:56:54.040 --> 00:57:03.510
probably do some, uh, more hiking, um, this summer and I'm going to assume

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:08.630
the recording will work fine here, but my guests are frozen because my network

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.190
has puked for some reason.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.590
I hear you, but your video's not moving.

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:13.990
So I will keep talking.

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.390
Yeah.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.310
And cause I like to say goodbye to them before we end up here.

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:18.350
You don't hear me.

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:19.110
What's going on?

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.060
Danny Andreas.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.700
If you can ever hear me, please say something.

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:27.220
Do you know how to sing the closing riff or maybe he recorded it on his

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.020
no, I don't, but, uh, yeah,

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.180
you can still hear me.

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.700
They're telling me they can still hear me.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:36.540
Yes.

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.540
So, uh, I don't know what's going on and why they're broken.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.340
I'm afraid to refresh my page.

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:45.020
So, oh, that's weird.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:45.980
Danny can hear things.

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:46.620
Oh, you know what?

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.220
Um, off I've actually do a little bit of editing.

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:53.140
If you can hear yourselves, that means you will, your recordings will upload.

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.700
So pretend that I can hear you and we can wrap up here.

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:01.340
So, uh, Dan, I, I, I can't ask an open ended question.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.500
So I won't know when you're done.

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:07.420
So I would like to thank both Danny and, uh, Andreas, uh, global, global

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:10.620
warming, um, global verming global warming.

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.980
Well, it depends on the German accent.

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:16.140
I want to thank you both for, for being here.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.580
Um, so, uh, let me start with you, Andreas.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.940
Uh, any, any final words?

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:26.770
It was much fun seeing you and, and having a chance to get another episode out.

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:27.250
Love that.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:31.520
All right.

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.320
And how about you, Danny?

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.040
Thank you for that.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:35.510
Oh, this was a thrill.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:37.710
I've been trying to get on the podcast for a long time.

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:39.590
Not very hard, but finally I tried.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:43.910
And, um, uh, one thing I'll leave you with, if you go to my blog,

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:47.990
swalchemist.blog, you will actually find, if you scroll long enough,

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:50.030
a picture of a cactus bloom.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:53.670
So, um, there's that, but you have to do a lot of scrolling to find it.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.830
So thanks everybody really enjoyed it.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:57.130
All right.

00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:01.130
This has been episode two 20 of the AB testing show.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:06.130
Uh, I am going to chef, seven, the outro post-prob because

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:07.770
career sides still screwing up on my side.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:08.610
Darn it.

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:10.090
I'll have to do some more editing, but thank you both.

00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:13.050
Uh, we'll see you next time on AB testing.
