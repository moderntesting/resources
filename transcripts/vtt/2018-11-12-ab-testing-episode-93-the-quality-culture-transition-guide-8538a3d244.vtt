WEBVTT

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.310
The modern testing podcast join your hosts Alan and Brent I am mindless agile

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.540
robot I must iterate as we talk about software engineering software quality

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.020
leadership and whatever else comes to mind now on with the show hey Brent hi

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.880
Alan it's good to be back yeah and thank you for listening yes been a

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.720
rough week Alan I'm sorry I'm sorry we moved into a we at unity yeah the thing I

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.640
saw you were in two headquarters oh so no no no no no no no so a test bash is

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.880
going on this week shut out the test bashers in San Francisco and Philippe

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.560
walked by the unity office probably the main one in San Francisco where test

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.400
bash is and waved at it we currently have two different offices in San

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.480
Francisco because we outgrew that one so we have one for ads and one for the rest

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.720
of unity at some point I believe we'll reconsolidate in a larger space so that's

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.560
that was my comment about two buildings but even better I currently now work in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.080
hands down the absolute nicest office I've ever been in in my life I visited

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.840
Google and I visited Facebook and screw them our unity Bellevue office is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.920
sometimes you walk in the rooms you just laugh cuz they're over the top we have

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.920
there it's really good it's really fun even our in a weird space before we were

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.680
we were renting some just some random office space for a shoved in there until

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.040
we could build something and we're in Lincoln Square those you know know the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.520
area the new Lincoln Square building which is four blocks away from the old

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.080
Lincoln Square building where I used to work on Microsoft Teams but it is very

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160
good we still get lunch served every day and now we have our own kitchen on

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.760
site so we have chefs and food staff that prepare that for us and it is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.690
fantastic I will say the time so there is a when when James worked at Google

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:38.660
he invited me over several times to go do lunch there and the lunch experience

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.780
at Google is just yeah there's is there's a choice there because there's so

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.260
many people they can be there's different chef stations depending on what

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.100
you want to do we get one lunch for everyone there's enough right of there

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.540
it's very good so anyway office is good I missed the grand opening the week they

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.320
moved in I was in Europe visiting with my team which was good Europe was good

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.400
got I had meet with the group formerly known as my leads because only one of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.560
them still works for me anymore through the power of modern testing I still

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.680
coach mentor helped them a lot all of them so that's going on but interesting

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:29.730
conversations about what this means and and how that fits into how I guess at

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.640
a meta level how what happens when modern testing takes off we already had a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.160
message from one listener who did work himself out of a role and a job we took

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.480
care of we talked about in a mailbag a few episodes ago I have plenty of job

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.600
and plenty of role left but I'm also used to things with larger scope so I'm

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.320
trying to the thing we're working together on it's good to have this

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.710
group people to work with is how do you if you're you imagine the visual I

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.110
guess is is as I'm delegating more of this work away to developers and other

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.710
people as we move towards something like modern testing what do I feel that void

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.590
with that gap with and some of this just you know some of that scope continues but

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.270
what happens is is more like it's delegated I do gain more capacity and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.270
it's good to have a plan as you gain capacity and ability to do more stuff

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.690
you have a pipeline to fill those things I have a pipeline but the water is

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.090
not on full blast it's trickling in some working on that that is those such the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.240
transitions can can definitely be challenging yeah I think and I was

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.840
prepared for it it just what happens is again with the visual if it all of a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.200
sudden pours out faster than you expected yo wait I got to turn the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.000
water on over here so imagine you have a bucket and you have water pouring out

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.880
one side you have water pouring it at the same speed your bucket stays full

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.280
my water started pouring out of my bucket faster than my incoming stream

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.160
yes so so the capacity went up as the water level went down not a huge issue

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.120
but just something we talked a lot about like what do we do what are some

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.480
options just trying to find the best things to do we is the group formerly

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.930
known as my leads oh so we had our it's not just you they're even having no no

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.290
no cuz they're there in no no it's mostly me okay mostly me all right so

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.290
anyway we work together are there consequences to know of your leads

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.610
express or your former leads expressed any sort of negative consequences

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.400
absolutely not they're they're they feel supported by their new manager they

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:59.320
do they do all right all is well oh yeah that is we done data science what yeah

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.840
that's that's what you do next data science I should be doing more with data

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.600
and I have a couple options there but probably not to be discussed here okay I

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.400
don't know if I've ever mentioned this before one of the thing before we get

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:25.800
into the meat of the topic of the day is I think my LinkedIn profile my advice

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.640
is and I did this for a while at Microsoft is just don't put your title

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.040
in your LinkedIn title don't just for when I did generic employee as my title

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.520
as my job title the random recruiter and BS mail I got from people went

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:52.460
remarkably down it all depends on where you are in terms of wanting to explore

00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:01.100
the the job market I well no because there's two things I get I don't just get

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.140
random job recruitment things I got two different emails this week asking me if

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.640
I wanted to be a contract s debt on Windows we looked at your profile we

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.320
think you may be a good fit for this I said did you know did you did you

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:23.420
actually respond no I didn't okay the thing is I don't want and and but

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.940
what's worse than the random recruiting things is the amount of vendor spam I

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.860
get both in LinkedIn and somehow they got they figured out my email address I

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.420
don't know where but the amount I get sent to both my Alan angry weasel calm

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:46.100
which listeners know and my my unity account on you let us help you

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:52.340
revolutionize your QA testing business with our QA automation tools and and

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.860
testers we can help you improve the reliability and stability of your testing

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.300
process and I'm just making up crap but that's what their stuff sounds like too

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.940
and then not only do some of this stuff that I delete or go straight straight

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.280
to my spam folder some of these vendors actually get mad that I don't reply Alan

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.120
you haven't replied to our mail what is wrong with you what the hell is what the

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.060
hell are you doing why don't you care about quality not in those words but but

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.900
follow up after follow up can I please have 30 minutes to tell you how stupid

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.660
you're being by not contacting us and holy crap like non-stop I get 20 a week

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.060
and now they're set up they all go to my spam folder so only see him I go

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.620
empty out my spam make sure nothing good in there but it is absolutely over the

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:44.820
top ridiculous like no I don't want to hire an army of vendors to test my web

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:52.020
by website because 10% maybe 5% a tiny bit of what I do our websites and no I

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.500
don't want to write a gazillion selenium tests just this morning I got

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.580
a note I got a note over LinkedIn saying hey are you interested in

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:08.920
selenium certification you know my answer is that I didn't lie yeah it's no

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:17.270
trucking way so I yeah I that is and my title is I think this quality director

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:29.120
and not QA director not test manager I want to direct quality I want to be in

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.240
charge of quality which I which means I influence a lot of people and sometimes

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.640
I don't remember when someone oh I signed up for a webinar and I accidentally put

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.060
in my right phone number and they called me oh dude and I didn't what

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.580
happened was is it was a Chrome autofill and normally I purposely delete

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.040
out the phone number or I'll alter it if they require it and I must have missed

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.960
it and they called and wanted to know what do testers do and said not what

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.240
you expect what are testers you know what you expect leave me the hell alone

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.190
yeah I know they're I know this is their business and but hell and then one last

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.870
thing is every once in a while I will because I'll glance at some of these

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.510
things I'll just kind of see what they're selling and go oh god no

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.390
everyone's mostly something wow that's actually kind of cool and I won't give

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:25.110
any names here but I will follow up a little bit and say well tell me more

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.390
about this how does it work is there a demo cool or a video whatever and then I

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:37.060
asked about pricing and it is a tools are a crazy market which is weird giving

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:44.020
how many good tools are available open source because some of these tools are

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.140
three thousand five thousand ten thousand dollars ahead subscription for

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.900
fifty thousand dollars a year like wow that's a lot of money even in

00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:01.940
Microsoft dollars yeah there the but then again you balance what's only half

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:08.020
an employee for a year to have that well the problem is is that is again these

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:15.460
tool companies that are essentially targeting niche markets yes all right

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.140
their license fees have to be through the roof yeah I know they had to make

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.660
money I get it I get the business model but it's a tough place to be in it I mean

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:35.020
you have only a certain level of business size that can support that cost yeah yeah

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:40.980
it's it's not a business market that I would want to be in no no and a lot of

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:52.540
times I have to shy it away there is this this one tool that that I

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:59.660
really really really really love it really makes things simple but it's six

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:11.220
grand for a single user and you have to renew it on an annual basis yeah and I'm

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:22.210
like you know what don't love it that much and I could rewrite it with greater

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:33.450
than six grand worth of satisfaction through Python or R for for my needs

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.770
yeah the the frugality of I mean I'm sure it's the right price for the market

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.050
but the frugality of it of me my frugalness makes you think God that's

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:48.770
really tough to justify anyway but vendors if you're listening I know you're

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:57.680
not please stop if I don't call me I'll call you yeah I the the vendor stuff even

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.400
the people I get the same crap and the problem is it is there is good stuff out

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.680
there but I know it's there what the good stuff I know it's there if I don't I'll

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:15.120
find it so I got one just this week and it's it's one of the few I've gotten

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.700
recently where where I like huh that might be interesting and it's Facebook

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.500
reached out they they're looking to bolster their leadership team and what

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.640
they call the data analytics space and I'm like okay that could potentially be

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:42.450
interesting wait where's Facebook Oh Seattle yeah no I guess I'm not driving

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:48.100
or working in Seattle you take a bus I take a bus nope do I do mailbags first

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:54.820
or do the thing first let's do mailbags first because I think it feeds in okay hey

00:13:54.820 --> 00:14:06.770
we have a couple questions from the mailbag from Johan his question there

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:12.250
have been a lot of discussions about how to get testers to change and adapt MT

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:19.690
but in my work now I talk more to developers so I was wondering what parts

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:25.690
have you found hard to get buy-in from developers and how do you get through to

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:33.330
them as an example number five seems to be a big thing for testers but with

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.970
developers I've not had an issue with a single number for me developers have

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.260
liked the idea and bought into them almost from the start and the issues

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:48.060
start to come after a while when they understand how much responsibilities they

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:55.250
really have it's kind of sounds like he's figured it out already MT isn't

00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:00.330
about improving or adapting your testing as as an individual at least MT is

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.210
about leadership and quality if you're able to lead the team towards those

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:13.340
things and improve that quality culture then you are then you are doing the

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.480
right thing read me the first sentence again before I think in his

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:23.240
elaboration he answered it well so the here's the question what parts of modern

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.400
testing have you found hard to get buy-in from developers and how do you get them

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:36.080
it depends on the developer I think in my experience on some teams just getting

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.720
him over the hump of like oh you can actually do testing is once they begin

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.880
to understand that things go much quicker but if you have an old school

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.040
like I can imagine developers at Microsoft you tell them to do testing

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:56.680
they go screw you not my job I would say the the hardest part of it is is

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:04.920
on that front right multiple folks have pushed back on MT making the statement

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:12.070
but but dev doesn't want to do testing right and now number one I'm pretty sure

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:18.060
I've said this here before right you don't build a whole test discipline just

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.860
because some other discipline doesn't want to do that work okay that's number

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:33.700
one number two once you've worked with the developers then this is where I would

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:41.010
say is the hardest part when when I did unified engineering it was actually

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:50.410
rather easy because I basically said you know what developer so if you recall I

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:57.630
had a combined team some that came back from xdev some came from xtest when I

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:07.220
stated this requirement it the the test was like oh sure makes sense no problem

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:15.210
okay but what I found is as the developers who really didn't want to do

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:20.010
the testing they would take shortcuts and they would ship the prod and then

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:26.210
there was another process that I had where essentially bugs get funded by the

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:32.980
whole team and so and on the board is fairly transparent so when when you

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:42.320
hotshot dev specialist basically gaining the perception of the team has to

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:50.230
prepare for an interrupt every time your thing ships the social behavior begins

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:59.910
to to I get it I get it I think it's preparing there's a perceived perceived

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:09.100
velocity drop when developers own quality and testing it's not perceived it is real

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:15.300
no no it's perceived because I'm if because they don't count the rework time

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.220
that will happen later after they find all their bugs that's why I mean

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:25.140
perceived so the other thing that I did back in those days is I had the similar

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:31.630
sign you know like you see a like construction sites a sign that says zero

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:39.420
days without incident man so I had a similar thing and I said okay guys when

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:46.220
we get to 30 days without anything lunch is on me not Microsoft me we're all

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:54.640
gonna go to roost Chris it took them six months to get there and every time it

00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.920
got to like 28 and then one of those developers checked in something and

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:07.400
didn't do enough testing right the social pressure kicked in the but also

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:14.560
having that measure and that goal was something that helped positive behavior

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:21.040
the last thing though because it's part of this where they have this theory right

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:28.480
oh it's gonna delay time it's gonna do all it's gonna add time delays I don't

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.680
want to do this work in the first place once I got through that hurdle once I

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:43.020
got the 30 days bug-free we didn't have a we got to like 60 once we got the 30

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.340
because what happened is they kept on having to re-arc they had to re-discuss

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:57.310
they they both they added on the right test cases and it turned that developer

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:05.230
completely 180 degrees to a place where they were upset when I left because

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.550
they're like holy crap what if my new manager forces me to go back to this

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:17.180
old stupid world right so it's if you make it visible then the problem that

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.780
you're talking about kind of goes away yeah but I guess maybe even the shorter

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:28.900
answer is there may be some initial problems on some calm legacy dev teams

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:37.660
but but I think in my experience beyond that developers are they see much less

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.540
controversy in MT than testers do because again modern testing isn't about

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.500
testing it's about building software in a way that is much more efficient and

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:55.310
delivers customer value better and more frequently than traditional testing so

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.110
it makes sense his experience makes sense I expect that would be the same for

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.270
everyone will be less controversy with dev teams in fact I think it was I

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:09.950
Michael Cross who showed the video of my test bash Brighton talk on modern

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:16.820
testing which was the debut of Monty the modern tester and his dev team washed

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.270
it and they said things like oh it's just common sense so I think it's gonna

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.350
be typical on most dev teams and and the ones that freak out are the ones

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.230
that either need a lot of work from you as a leader to get them there or

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:36.680
teams just to run away from and let them die a slow miserable death of failure

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:47.810
what's the next question on that bright note from Ryan Ryan the Ryanator for a

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:54.110
team that is starting to practice the MT principles what would you recommend as

00:21:54.110 --> 00:22:02.110
the first steps how would you show MT's value to stakeholders managers that have

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:11.210
a traditional testing mindset I see now why you thought this would be a good segue

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:20.540
into the main topic of the day so let's answer this question for the next 25

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:26.780
minutes okay if you don't mind I don't okay good good to be clear and I

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.220
mentioned this before but the lead-up here I'll say it again I have not once

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:38.230
ever gone to anyone at unity anyone on my teams is saying here's this thing I

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:43.390
call modern testing we're gonna do it here are my principles we should all

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.430
follow them that's one it wouldn't work but two it's just not the way I

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:56.430
do things I don't think anyone should do that well I'm just clear I don't so I

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.390
don't want anyone to think that oh you can just say you're doing it and you'll

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:05.390
show people the the video and put the principles on the wall and bam we are

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:14.860
MT there are a lot of folks that have asked for like specific steps to do

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.540
this and I'm honestly rather worried about being overly prescriptive because

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.380
it's gonna be a tautology but leading people leading teams towards modern

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:35.910
testing is a leadership challenge yes so one way but it's also not an

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:45.020
intellectually lazy one correct so well let me tell you a little bit how this

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.940
came about I the thing I'm about to talk about I gave a talk at the test

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:59.980
leadership Congress in New York in May I believe keynote on leading a quality

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.950
culture and I at that point I talked a lot about quality culture what it meant

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:14.060
to me a lot about leadership test leadership conference Congress but I

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:19.900
hadn't thought at least formally about what actually is how would you define

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.860
at a more granular level what a quality culture is and then maybe just a few

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.700
weeks later I was in a conversation at unity with my manager and a few of my

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.580
peers and this idea of like I start I was I quality culture on the mind I

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.780
was talking about quality culture and I said well what is it how would you

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:43.230
define it and and I said let me I think I can do that let me write that

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:49.500
down and I thought about it for a couple days and and thought and thought I

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:56.110
said I don't know what to write down how do I how can I quantify in some way or

00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:01.590
what how do I describe a quality culture in a way that covers all the things that

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:06.650
would that would lead a team towards quality I very much put a modern

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:12.090
testing lens on it and that I looked at agile and lean and the modern

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:17.730
testing principles I thought what what makes a team function in an empty way

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:23.730
and all of a sudden at some point something clicked and I do so much work

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:29.130
air-quilt work just driving around and walking the dog and thinking that when I

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:36.400
spit this thing out originally it was like an hour of work and it's had some

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.120
tweaking since then but not overhauled edits so what I built after that long

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:53.070
diatribe is a quality grid it's I I'm pausing because it frequently gets

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:59.310
referred to as a maturity model and I hate maturity models for many reasons

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:05.590
one is just a basic allergic this to things like CMM CMMI how about the

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:15.180
quality culture transition guide let's call it that quality culture transition

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:21.410
guide if I had internet access I change it right now my original doc so what I

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.410
did and the way this worked out and just do my thought process before we go

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.900
through these is I listed the hard part was coming up with what were the

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:35.900
attributes of a team really clicking on frequently delivering customer value

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:41.260
accelerating the achievement of quality what does a good dev team a good

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.260
engineering team look like delivering that as able to break it down into about

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.100
I should count them eight attributes but I'll read them then we'll kind of go

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.980
through them one by one I might have mentioned these on a previous podcast

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.930
we'll dive a little bit deeper today quality and test ownership and I'll come

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.300
back and go deeper into these like who owns quality technical debt and

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:11.180
maintenance code quality and tools customer data analysis the development

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:19.260
approach learning and improvement and leadership emphasis and Brent I'm gonna

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.100
ask you to interrupt me whenever you want otherwise I'm just gonna talk a

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:29.430
little bit about what I did those those headers are sort of horizontal aspects yes

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:34.030
you think or expect teams to be in fact it's probably a good time to

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:41.640
interject a partial answer to the question is I would look at how well the

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:48.200
team is doing on each of those aspects each of those horizontals and some areas

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:55.090
they may be more I'll put it in the accelerate way some teams may have more

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:59.890
capabilities in those areas than other in some areas than others you can use

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:09.000
this quality culture transition guide love it to figure out where one where you

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.400
are but not to grade yourself in the in the old world of maturity model but to

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.360
figure out where you may need to make improvement so let's talk about testing

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.720
breadth wait before you continue on there's there's one thing I would say

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:36.430
sure so first off with anything that's the one paradigm here you often hear it

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:46.420
as you can think of it as a crawl walk run type model exactly right now generally

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.690
my guidance when dealing with these type of things is first you go through an

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:59.410
inventory where you're at and then you go okay how do we get to the next column

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:05.650
don't try to skip columns generally is what I advise because a lot of times that

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:13.220
creates more problems than it's worth I definitely agree and but even that

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.260
even that approach sounds a little bit too much like the old maturity model

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:23.460
approach to me so what I have had teams do is sort of assess themselves on where

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.980
they are on the model sometimes just the the QA person on my team but more often

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:34.260
with a with the dev lead with them and then not worry about necessarily about

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.540
getting to the next box but okay we've gone through this now we've it's forced

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.180
us to take a different kind of retrospective on overall on what the

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.300
team is doing and how we approach software and delivery and building things

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.240
and what are one or two or three areas we want to work on improving in this

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:57.000
transition guide comes up a lot in retrospectives and in the incorporation of

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.110
an experimental or experimenting culture where you say hey let's brainstorm come

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:10.470
up with ideas around what what actions we should take let's take those actions

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.830
let's also determine how we're going to determine if it's success succeeded or

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:22.250
failed and if it failed no judgment call except if we you know try it again

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:26.570
or continue trying to power through that's the biggest thing that I see let

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:31.650
me I have a gazillion examples of how we've used this so let me just go ahead

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:36.670
get through it but I gotta get a little bit more I think the listeners need a

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.590
little bit more than just the headers so I'll talk a little bit about how I

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:46.310
built the model and what's in there so I built a transition guide a model I call

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:52.230
it the thing sometimes to avoid calling it any sort of maturity thing but there's

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:56.230
a starting level where the thing basically isn't happening where there is

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:00.230
no testing breath where people assume that doing some happy path tests is

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:05.000
enough what horizontal you talking about I'm talking about testing breath okay

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:13.140
this is testing breath so if you have a lack of almost complete lack of capability

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.700
in testing breath you're probably focused almost entirely on functional testing

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.760
and verification you may do some other things but they're not planned and

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.150
sporadic whereas if you are super mature and the way I built this was to kind of

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.350
describe what I thought like what is it if you're basically not doing this

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:38.950
and what is it like if you are like rock stars kicking butt at this superstars

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:46.030
and if you're at the top level building a multi-dimensional quality strategy is

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:51.470
part of how the team builds software design includes that your testing

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:55.430
approaches consistently cover all areas of like the agile quadrant you want to

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:59.830
use that model you're thinking about all aspects of quality your continues to

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.710
thinking about what are the different ways I mean the test is where do we

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:09.550
need to do perf securities involved early as a specialty but also you're

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.550
just thinking about all the different things and go wrong all the time and

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:18.490
we've we've dealt with teams like this so there are teams that do operate at

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.310
that level and of course there are levels in between where maybe you're

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.830
you're not you're getting to learn things but you're not doing them

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:28.510
consistently there's there's levels in between but the growth is from one end

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:35.840
to the other on the testing breath you're saying that there's a multi-dimensional

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:45.850
you say thinking I don't necessarily think you're referring to a you know a

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:50.770
traditional test plan no I said a quality strategy how do we build this

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:57.090
with quality meaning right I'm building a if I'm building YouTube probably not the

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.570
best MVP to start with but if I'm building YouTube I'm thinking about

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:07.090
scale and reliability and security and all those things from square one they're

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.530
not like oh wow I guess I should think about scale so there's the old-school

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:16.490
60-page test plan no no I'm just saying this criteria though it does not okay

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:23.050
because the old-school 60-page test plan was often not a strategy with often a

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:27.410
list of things and even worse a list of test cases that would be done against

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.930
these things I don't want that I this is about and you you're playing devil's

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:40.140
advocate here but this is about a full-breath quality strategy as is

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:46.550
planned and executed as part of building the thing you you and I have been on

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:52.750
teams where illities any perf or security or scale testing that's what we

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.550
did at the very end of the product when we knew we're gonna ship in two

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.190
weeks anyway and we found a bunch of bugs that people weren't gonna fix

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:03.300
because it was just too late because oh that's gonna be an architecture change

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:09.140
we can't do that now yeah the the other thing I would say in there would be

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:15.500
right adaptability is gonna be key in there right I think the biggest thing so

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:22.470
I think you're trying to express an element of holistic aspect yeah I want

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:26.230
you to recognize like all these things matter and we'll go a little faster

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.830
through the rest so we can finish well let me know yeah cuz we're never gonna

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:33.910
finish go ahead go ahead this number one I don't think you're saying anything

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:43.780
around prescriptive or are reactive right as you know I don't want everyone anyone

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.740
building the 80 page test plan what I'm saying is that all has to be done

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:54.700
before we ship all aspects of quality are considered from day one to day in

00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:00.150
that's it that's at the top level and there's steps you can think about what

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.710
you need to do to get there in between you again we can all think of the baby

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:10.310
steps I'm not gonna list them out here yep quality and test ownership at level

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.110
one is traditional testing I should even call it level one when you have

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.990
lack of capability you're doing there's a test team that does all the testing

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:22.350
because it's their job and it's not and developers do developing because it's

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:27.940
their job okay but at the other end I could probably set up with the last line

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.780
in this thing which I did not get any pushback even from people outside my

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:39.060
team where you truly have whole team owned quality and one of my gripes with

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.700
agile testing is even though Lisa and Janet Lisa Crispin Janet Gregory

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.940
describe whole team testing is everyone owns testing and quality often what I

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:54.300
see unfortunately on agile teams is even there is they iterate but the tester

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.220
stills the tester on the team still does all the testing the agile tester yeah I

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:04.140
don't think that's Lisa Janet no it's definitely not their intent they they sigh

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:11.420
visibly or or with verbs every time this comes up but I'll read the end of

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.700
this that the test specialist focuses on coaching the team and assisting

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.540
quality efforts sounds like MT blah blah blah and then last sentence where I did

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:26.490
not get any pushback because I've shared this across all of unity is teams at

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.930
this level may not need a dedicated quality specialist nobody shit their pants

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:36.580
nobody freaked out yeah I think we've talked about those things enough on

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.860
here we don't need to go any deeper yeah technical debt and one thing on

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:51.610
the last one that I'm tired of if everyone owns quality then nobody

00:36:51.610 --> 00:37:01.890
owns quality alright that's it okay so tech debt and maintenance this is the

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.410
biggest thing here something talked about is just working from a zero bug

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.410
backlog but we also need to recognize that bugs are not the only form of tech

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:14.340
debt keep your debt paid off keep it zero team that that is very has zero

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.540
or a little capability here has a huge bug backlog they have all kinds of to

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.940
do's riddled through the code they have they don't even know what static

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.860
analysis linter errors they have because they don't run those tools they

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:33.940
have a huge both known and unknown mound of tech debt whereas teams on the most

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:41.780
mature scale have little to zero leaning towards zero tech debt they just

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:46.650
don't carry it forward they pay their bills on time something else we've also

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:51.170
talked about in the context of empty a lot or they they cancel their

00:37:51.170 --> 00:38:00.130
subscription right to me a bug is not necessarily tech debt right as we've

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:06.150
talked on multiple cases there's many a bugs that are never worth fixing right

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:10.470
but I think just not even but I would say keeping those bugs around even if

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.790
you're not going to fix them that is debt because you end up looking at those

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:19.590
bugs over and over again that's waste is in my waste yeah fine and in between

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.830
you can see like okay we're keeping things triage we have a we have a fairly

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:28.550
low bug camp but we're happy with 20 and that's I guess it's a start but you

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.750
can look at where you are in between and where you want to go and figure

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:36.500
things out the team that when I started at unity had the highest bug

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.660
count and was the crummiest quality is now down finally under 10 total bugs

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:46.140
that they carry that they carry and there with the goal still to get to zero

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:50.060
by the end of the year but in fact another one of my teams that was when

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:55.140
that team got low there was another pair of teams that were then my new

00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:00.900
highest in the 30s and they just got to zero yesterday day before so slowly but

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:08.620
surely almost all of the teams in my jurisdiction area care about are still on

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.900
track to get to a zero bug backlog by the end of the calendar year and the

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.720
teams that have gotten there and sustained it what's their feedback it's

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:24.780
it's freeing right no I know that I'm yeah yeah that's how they feel yeah it's

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.540
all like oh this is much better but they don't miss doing triage beans we look

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:34.900
at the same bugs over and over and over no yeah I don't either yeah but the other

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.380
phenomenon that I noticed is that once you get to that state and you've

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:49.440
maintained that state it becomes a lot clearer that how bad feature development

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:55.160
was for you and you were carrying that bug backlog right the thing I've noticed

00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:02.720
with all the teams I've put them through is essentially this model sort of

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:11.020
encourages more scalable architectures and a scalable architecture allows you to

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:17.180
produce features when you trying to figure out how to not fund the bug but

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:24.580
string a feature through a minefield of a couple hundred bugs your estimates

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:30.850
go slower in your release like for sure yep you are correct go next attribute is

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:36.610
around code quality and tools and this means a team that does no capability

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:42.290
here they compile their code and then there and you can see these things

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:47.210
interact because if you're you're not going to be generally I have a hard time

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:52.700
thinking of a team who had no capability in some areas but we're very very high

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:57.450
in other areas so team they're not running they're probably compiling at a

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.490
look not at the highest warning level these aren't independent attributes right

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:06.010
exactly they will just like the modern testing principles yeah so they're not

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:10.410
using any to any code correctness tools things like code coverage which is a

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:15.570
wonderful tool in a horrible metric linters compiler warnings other static

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:20.370
analysis tools security analysis tools teams that are very mature here their

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:27.050
CI runs a crap ton of code correctness tools because that's where we can catch

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:32.090
the bulk of those things and that's where they should be caught not by tests

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:36.530
down the road this is like the level of tests that run before unit tests yeah

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.610
and then goes with tech debt so you turn on these linters I see teams turn

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:45.450
on linters and go oh this is bad I'm gonna have I'm gonna run the linter but

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:50.500
we're gonna turn off all the warnings like I you I get what you're doing

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.860
there but you you yeah teams that are very mature here they they are

00:41:54.860 --> 00:42:01.220
constantly trying to find holes or risk using code coverage they have linters and

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.020
static analysis tools running on on every check-in to make sure that they

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:11.190
have the highest code correctness they can and in the middle levels maybe

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:14.430
you're starting to use things be to look at the results or you turn or you

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:22.490
turn off a lot of the rules for our linters you're not I think teams at a

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.610
mature level here are also not just running these tools but they're looking

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.930
for additional tools my partner what they do is like oh what else do you

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:35.010
define this looking for code correctness tools as part of maybe some

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:39.610
of the investigation that comes out of a retro or an RCA analysis yeah the one

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:45.850
thing I guess it's RC analysis or otherwise it's redundant release no no

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:51.130
root cause analysis rather than saying RCA analysis is redundant right it's like

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:59.530
an ATM machine anyway go on right yeah the one thing I was actually really

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:09.040
fond of back in the day was measuring cyclo-matic complexity oh yeah yeah at

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:16.400
the nice and even complexity metrics are a great thing for risk we had you

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:21.000
and side to engineer unity had a hack week they had to have one every year I

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.560
haven't been to one yet my travel is a little crazy this summer but I did make

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.080
sure I took a half a day during hack week in the Seattle office and just do

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:36.340
something random and the random thing I did was I wrote again using some

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:45.060
helpers from the NPM library I wrote a little node app that would look at the

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:50.860
files you had checked out run a complexity analysis tools around a bunch

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.160
of different around cyclo-matic complexity Halsted metrics and some other

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.220
complexity analysis and we give home with an overall number and I would flag files

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:05.780
or functions that had in just your checked out files that have a high

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:11.720
level level over and whatever N was of complexity because complexity doesn't

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.480
mean the code is buggy it's a smoke alarm out of fire it means there is risk there

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:25.890
yeah I mean that the one thing that I haven't observed yet is tooling that can

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:34.810
analyze how you've put together your code and help to simplify it yeah hey if

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:39.450
you if you incorporate this design pattern instead of the thing that you did

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:44.050
you'd be able to reduce part of it is part of the maturity here is continuing

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:48.450
to search for things like that yes chances are eventually they'll exist

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:55.570
next thing near and dear to do you have a heart no okay near and dear to the

00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:00.170
cavity and branch chest where a heart would live is customer data analysis yay

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:05.970
we're at a where you had low capability you don't do it you don't collect anything

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:10.330
about higher products being used and then you can imagine we've talked about

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:16.770
Brent's data maturity model in here before right but I think the lower lowest

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:21.850
capability I would hope this doesn't exist but it would essentially be your

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:30.600
entire team functions off of what's the founder syndrome which is essentially no

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:41.110
founder of a startup has ever has ever understood why his idea isn't the hottest

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:46.270
thing since pancakes yeah and I'm actually gonna read through the model

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:51.230
here because I think it'll help explain it and I'll go quickly I'll skip so free

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:58.360
in this transition guide I wrote I wrote a couple levels in between to help

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.800
figure help teams like figure out where they were in the middle and figure out

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.880
what kind of things they could do to improve and I have a whole accompanying

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.000
doc I wrote internally it talks a little more deeply this will be in the

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.230
twenty twenty eight release of the modern testing book I'm just making that

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.870
twenty twenty eight yeah I figure it'll take that long it'll be obsolete

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.590
like oh we're coming up on the ten year anniversary of how we test off

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:24.030
right Microsoft by the way I'll need to write a blog post about that so anyway

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:30.710
on data analysis I mentioned like it's data is untracked or ignored with a few

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:35.040
more capabilities a little more higher along the transition guide you're gonna

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:40.080
have some data track that may be used to understand quality prioritization data

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.480
may be discarded if it does not match intuition or anecdotal feedback and

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.520
we've seen this happen but you're starting to collect data you just don't

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.520
trust it yet because it's it's yeah it's what do you call this data affirmed

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:59.610
yeah that's similar to that level it was a Steve Rowe call it that but I've now

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:02.290
stolen it all right yeah and I stole it from you

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:10.330
yay me and then even before you get to the most you know optimal level you

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:13.330
may be at a level where the team has at least a handful of metrics in place

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:17.370
that help them understand feature quality and customer experience there's probably

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:20.210
some holes in interpreting the data but those usually address quickly

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:25.290
instrumentation and or analytics as part of the requirements are done definition

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:28.770
and almost all and almost always done as part of feature development so at

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:38.290
that point you're well on your way to becoming data centric but like all

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.970
things that are like maturity models even if we don't like to call them that

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:46.530
there's a level where that can be okay for a while for some teams you don't

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:52.050
have to get to the highest level in everything no I like that it's a guide

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:56.250
yes it's to help you read you read through and figure out okay here's

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.010
something I can do more of this is actually the way I want it to be used is

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:06.210
for I mean in a very immature quality culture you might think that okay once

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:09.450
the test team plays with the buttons and things for 10 minutes or an hour or

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:14.450
a day then we ship and it's good but looking at what are all the things that

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:18.370
actually influence a quality culture two more rows to go through three more

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:23.550
ways to get last one can you reread that very quickly again no because I

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:27.550
paraphrased what I wrote so it'll be even different so the team has a

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.030
handful of metrics in place help them understand feature quality customer

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.950
experience although there may be some holes they're usually addressed quickly

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:39.550
analytics as part of the requirements or done definition and almost always done

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:43.230
as part of feature development okay okay because what I think you said was

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:48.670
instrumentation before analytics is a much better word yeah I have I used both

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:55.070
in here so but the one problem I also see and this by no means is a north star

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:59.910
that we're trying to guide people towards and that is a lot of times you'll

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:04.910
see in the traditional world you'll see a PM with their 60 page spec listing out

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:09.950
requirements and then there's a three page section of all the instrumentation

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:16.460
requirements and it's just a grab bag of random crap here I would say go back to

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:24.220
what episode was it 62 the hypothesis episode where I I don't know remember

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.700
the exercise I walked you through yeah I don't know it was in the I was in the

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:32.300
80s that's far more helpful all right really important thing is the

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:38.630
development approach and this is where a lean and agile come in at the zero

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:43.990
capability level you have no approach it's pure cowboy write it and compile it

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:50.030
and ship it world we're at the end of course you have a system Brent and I both

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:56.140
prefer Kanban but basically you have working in small batches flow is high

00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:01.300
you probably are using experimentation to deliver features or delivering things

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:06.300
behind flags you have a development approach that allows the team to ship

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:12.460
quickly and safely which is worse try to think through which is worse big design

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:24.970
up front or cowboy equally bad that is a good question I like to tweet that well

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:30.370
they do I want anarchy or over prescription and very quickly because

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:34.930
we're a little tight on time yeah the last two are learning and improvement I

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:38.530
mentioned earlier we're and we've been on teams that don't give a crap about

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.890
improving there's no retros they don't try and get better at anything they're

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.530
just happy to crank out their crummy software day after day where on the other

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:50.410
end of the spectrum you probably have teams where you do have teams who retro

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:53.450
they do recognize that retros are the most important things they can do

00:50:53.450 --> 00:51:00.050
every week the whole team is a learning organization people focus on

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:04.530
learning and getting better and growing as part of the software development and

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:08.450
that helps improve culture overall which reminds me to refer to the lens

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:13.880
you only work that shows that organizational health which I think

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:20.230
comes from this is direct as a direct correlation with product quality it does

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:25.280
there is a absolute principle there that may be of what you just mentioned you're

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:30.120
gonna post this up on MT at some point at some point I'm not sure if I want to

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:36.930
share the whole grid yet but I will okay and then the last level is around

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:42.210
leadership emphasis which I you gave me some feedback which I thought about and

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:48.020
rejected I don't think that mandates of thou shalt have a quality culture work

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:54.880
so the the maturity here the growth is a little interesting so we'll just cover

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.240
it briefly and then you can send us a bunch of mail by questions we'll dive in

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:04.280
deeper in the following weeks is at a at the lowest level here there is no

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:09.120
leadership support zero because they did they just there's nothing that that

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.320
supports sort of that cowboy culture we talked about in development approach

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.840
and everything else and that can come from multiple different ways yeah

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:22.940
whereas as you get a little bit more mature the leadership communicates

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.540
quality is they like say quality is important it's part of what we do it's

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:34.840
in our vision etc and at the most mature level it's you get to a level

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:39.040
where leadership doesn't need to be involved because the team is

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.560
internalized qualities what they do I mean it's still part of the rallying cry

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.800
anyway we'll dive deeper later but that's sort of how that works and I

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.720
didn't get to talk about the examples we'll do that why don't we plan on doing

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:55.480
that next time yeah there's more I what would want to talk about for Ryan's

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.080
let's figure out a good agenda of topics and things we want to dive into

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:05.360
next time hope that was a good start to an answer for Ryan's question and we'll

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:11.800
continue to answer it on the next time we talk on A-B testing okay goodbye

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.120
everybody bye
