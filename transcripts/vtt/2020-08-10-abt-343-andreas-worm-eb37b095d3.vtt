WEBVTT

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:11.900
This is the AB testing 343 podcast a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.380
three questions about almost anything

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.180
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.580
We're back again for another ABT

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.740
343 and this time all the way from

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.540
Germany, I think is

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.540
Andres warm

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.140
One yeah. Hi. Thanks for having me. Yeah one just like the one on the ground and

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.420
But spelling wise it's it's spelled worm

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.220
Okay, that's a pronunciation. Yeah

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.100
For the for the Americans, which is I only bring that up because your nickname on our slack is really cool

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100
It's it's a nice little pun

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.840
global warming and I love it I guess I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.280
always

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.480
Always thought it's called one because earth one Jim is I think we have it's one

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.440
It works. Just just just just ignore my American ignorance. I love the name

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.120
I'm super glad to have

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:26.440
You know on this podcast I ask a few questions usually three plus tangents so more three or more questions

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.720
To one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast. So as sort of a pre question, I'm curious

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.160
How did you learn about the podcast or modern testing?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.240
Where did you learn about this thing that Brent and I call modern testing? I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.560
Somehow stumbled upon your podcast. I'm not sure if I saw it on LinkedIn or on the MOT slack

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.880
someone linked me to episode 104 and

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.840
That was the first time I heard about the podcast and your your seven principles and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.040
Yeah, and a few episodes after

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.760
Joined the one of three slack. So what did we talk about in 104? Oh, that's a great question

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.360
Maybe we turn off investment

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.280
Maybe I'm sure I could look it up

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.240
Just curious Brent sometimes remember these of course we have some episodes that we

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.040
Always remember like we know like we talked about so-and-so in such episode

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.200
It's caught leading quality with one

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.080
Sean

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that one was a good interview with a bad recording

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.720
On the old equipment. We have better equipment. That's why this one sounds so much better a bit

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.920
How have you applied modern testing to any of the work that you've done, you know since you found the podcast

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.180
Since I found the podcast, that's hard. I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.220
Because I didn't really do much. I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.490
Just discovered it like a week or two weeks ago, and I'm currently without a project. So there's no real

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.290
real code base or team or product I could apply anything to I

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.480
Thought about starting an old part of my own podcast. Maybe I can

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.120
Introduce some quality there or get rapid feedback

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.760
Whatever

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.800
No, I discovered. Well, I basically lift the or some of the principles

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.150
for a long time

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.470
most things on the list I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.250
Already did because I had the had the luck to to learn in a very quality focused environment

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.910
so

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.110
things like customer first

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.390
Quality inbuilt from the beginning and sharing knowledge and continuously improving

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.350
Have been always there as you said, as you said the quality the principles are very old

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.350
You

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.830
They're not so new nothing nothing. Yeah, nothing new you've made my point for me

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.910
So let's get the softballs aside

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.110
Let's talk about scrum. I know you are a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.470
supporter of scrum and I want to talk about that and

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.350
also

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.070
That you have seen scrum used incorrectly a lot. So

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.550
Let's just go with that. Tell me about your experience with scrum

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.350
How your problems you've run into how it's helped with modern testing and I'm gonna sit back and listen to you

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.910
Teach me for a while

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.630
after I

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.830
finished my three years of learning to be a software developer, I basically did the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.790
scrum master certification and

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.390
the place where I learned and worked

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.570
Knew about scrum. My my boss was a supporter of scrum and

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.090
As like scrum as like one of the best

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.050
methodologies to develop complex

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.970
software products

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.970
we had a team of like

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.490
five six people and

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.050
We tried to do scrum to be agile

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.680
no

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.160
No scrum implementation is perfect. We were always learning but

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.080
We were very aware of some of the

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.880
Missing parts of scrum. We didn't do scrum correctly, but we

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.560
applied as much as we could or as we wanted to

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.040
have an environment of

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.600
continuous improvement and learning and not doing the same the same about twice and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.480
yeah

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.520
having having a customer focus and working with data and

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.360
one of the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.360
Maybe I should tell about the project

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.440
So we have a little bit of context that I'm what I'm talking about

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.080
our little company of six people

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.080
mostly developed

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.120
event ticketing

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.560
system the storefront where you could buy tickets for for concerts and

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.280
museums and these things online

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.280
Pretty local and we had like

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760
at any time

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.480
6,000 events active, which is I guess nothing compared to huge

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.080
I don't know what your local equivalent is

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.280
yeah, but for our team pretty pretty nice and

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.000
yeah, we

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
did this for our client and

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.880
one problem we

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.560
Often came back to was our missing product owner

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.880
because

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.280
When you when you go with the scrum guide you want to have like

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.480
self-sufficient

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.480
autark what was the term?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.880
The word escapes me, but you want the team to have all the ability to do and make decisions and

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.560
Develop the product we

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.660
Were working for a client. So the client had

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.660
much say and

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.520
Which direction we went and what to develop and

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.570
Yeah, sometimes the the

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.860
So you could you could say the client was the product owner

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.920
but

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.240
you could

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:44.440
Yeah, and the role the role the person's the person's changed from time to time and we had better product owners and sometimes worse product owners and

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.220
and

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.420
Yeah, that was one issue

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.380
In hindsight, it would have made maybe made sense to

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.650
to fight for

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.690
autonomy

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:06.310
To say hey come we we align on the basic goals you want to achieve the basic like the customer segments you want to to

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:14.940
Talk to to have more conversion with whatever and let us handle the the tasks and how to do it and

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.140
How to get the feedback and

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.660
But in hindsight, that's easy to say

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.840
I'm gonna have you I'm gonna put you on the hot seat here with some special questions because I

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.320
have my I

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:39.040
Can't say that I hate scrum because I don't I think it's valuable and useful and often

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.980
Misused so I don't think I'm gonna tell you anything you haven't heard before I miss use

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.500
Let me give you some complaints I have about scrum and just kind of give me your answers on them

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.860
Just for those you listening along there has been no prep for these. He is completely on the spot. So I

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.490
will ask try to ask these in an open-ended way, so one is

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.820
The rituals of scrum there are a lot of meetings that go along with the scrum framework. There's the daily stand-up

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.620
Which we can go into which it has some pros and cons

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.880
When done right or wrong and as a tangent

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:23.140
It seems like every day on the internet someone publishes an article saying why agile doesn't work and they describe some horribly

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.060
Bastardized version of agile and you go. Yeah, of course you don't get it. That's why it doesn't work

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.620
so so going back to scrum rituals, there's the

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:38.700
There's the backlog grooming and the daily stand-up and the retros and there are probably a few other ones. I'm forgetting so

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
What are some pros and cons of?

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.100
Let's just stick with daily stand-up and

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:51.420
Actually, let's talk about all that lead up. What are the pros and cons? What are the ways the daily stand-up is?

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.420
Extremely important part of scrum and what are some ways in that meeting can be useless

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.190
Let's let's first distinguish between age and scrum

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.890
a child when I talk about a

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:13.750
When I talk when in my mind agile is the main resource for agile is the age of manifesto and

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:21.380
I love okay. I like talking about scrum more because scrum has a more concrete

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.060
Rule set you can compare to it and I'm gonna stop go on go on

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.760
I was gonna interrupt and give away your answer for you. So keep going

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.210
so

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.930
Whatever the actual implementation is you're you are doing

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:45.290
all the all the rituals mentioned in the scrum guide and

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.520
You can okay. That's our main source for doing scrum is a scrum guide and

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.400
These rituals have a purpose

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:02.470
These rituals don't add meetings or are a waste of time because any everything you do in these rituals

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.390
must be done to

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.060
build something and

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.660
scrum tries to

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.720
Say, okay. Why don't you use at regular intervals these ways of

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:24.460
communicating and collaborating to build something because you have to do it anyway, that's why the most

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.700
effective way of communicating and collaborating and

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.000
sharing new information aligning on goals

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.200
and get feedback from stakeholders and

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.430
Quality what what's the second part of the question?

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:51.570
Because I have a love relationship, okay stand up without leading you I'm gonna see if you can guess why I think the stand-up

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.070
It can be awesome and why it often isn't

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.490
through discovering I'm doing a lot more on

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:05.360
On the learning side because I have a project and I also discovered the liberators network and

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.440
the

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.480
Zombie scrum, do you know of that?

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:17.240
Yes, you read my mind you're in my head. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it's very very interesting

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.920
You can boil that down to you have to have

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.180
passion excitement new things you don't want to have to

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:36.100
Trot over into the meeting room. Yeah yesterday. I did this and that now I'm not blocked. Okay, see you tomorrow

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.060
Yeah, you have to keep it fresh exciting and

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.850
one thing I'm

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.770
Recently learning is the importance of the sprint goal and in hindsight

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.890
That was something which could have helped us very much in our

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.230
Eight years of developing this event ticketing system and doing scrum there

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.380
Keep it. Yeah

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.110
Keep it interesting

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.150
Yes

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:11.590
The difference with you over a lot of people that have done scrum is they kind of pick a little bits of it

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.590
And it doesn't quite work. I think the sprint goal

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:20.270
It's a pat lunch. You only calls the rally and cry getting a team to a line about around something

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.270
I think that's super important as well

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.070
And then the zombies the zombie stand-ups people

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:33.110
Every day saying they're working on the same thing and it's the same thing that did yesterday and they're never blocked on anything

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:39.430
Which is really comes down to the importance of a good scrum master for the team

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:45.930
And I am missing out on there's a really good book. I read and recommend on

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:51.570
Being a scrum master and if you're doing scrum, I think go ahead

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.970
We didn't have a scrum master either

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.850
So that's the challenge that I think

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.090
It's

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.970
Incredibly important to have a good scrum master

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:11.850
Someone who knows what to do and can dig past those things and this book that I'm talk I can't find

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.430
I don't want to search for it any longer while I'm talking here

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.010
So I'm not going to but it does a good job

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.970
talking about the role of the scrum master as a servant leader for the organization and

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.290
Helping the team be successful and aligning them on what they're doing

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:32.050
Asking the right questions to get the team that did the right level of communication for that team to be successful

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.370
Which aligns very well with the agile manifesto and agile principles

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:42.850
Which I think a lot of people who do scrum haven't they think of scrum as being equal to agile for so

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.290
Thanks for calling that out that they're not and then

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.220
You are talking about people saying

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.700
Agile doesn't work because we are doing scrum wrong and I'm saying yeah, we are doing scrum wrong

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.100
But agile did work. I have seen enough people

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.380
Make mistakes with scrum that I prefer not to use it

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.960
But I have nothing against scrum being used properly

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.100
But I think you are gonna need someone to play the role of scrum master for it to really work well for the team

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.460
Honestly scrum is a nice transition for those used to more

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.540
Traditional models because it gives you you get nice little tight iterations. In fact

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.380
done poorly

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:35.360
Scrum is an example of the spiral model of software delivery can be a way of accelerating waterfall done poorly

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.580
but if you actually

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:45.260
Understand how scrum works within the frame of agile it can actually be very effective. So I have nothing against it

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.660
I just seems to be done wrong a lot

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.460
So it's kind of scared me away from recommending it to a lot of teams

00:15:51.940 --> 00:16:00.200
Versus just coaching them towards understanding the principles of agile in the first place. I'm off of myself box in your notes

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:08.360
You said that you like scrum, but mostly for egocentric reasons. I'd like to hear some more about that

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:14.160
yeah, the the the best part about the wedding cry and and

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.570
the

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.170
consumer and customer centric view is

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.160
Motivation

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.000
Because I'm I'm deriving lot of purpose in my life for my work

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.760
So as long as you can convince me that my work is valuable

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.360
I will be much more motivated to work and

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.190
doing doing boring stuff doing stuff where I

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:50.390
Don't see the value for the customer doing something which is just thrown in the bin

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:58.830
Which was clear before and will totally demotivate me and I guess many people

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:08.080
Will suffer from this fate when they don't see the bigger picture then they don't see the value added when they don't make lives better

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.400
it's

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:19.240
It's easier to follow when you have some someone who's really passionate and has has you has you convinced that what you are building is great. I

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.230
Don't see that as

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:27.190
Egotistical to me that's about having a sense of purpose for your work

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.430
And I tie that back to Dan Pink's works like you need to have

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.910
autonomy mastery and sense of purpose you need to be able to figure stuff out and

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:42.910
Be able to do it and feel like you're in like what you work on matters and that's not egotistical

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.470
That's just it is taking care of yourself

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.630
But it's you know when I look at Dan Pink's those three principles that I just mentioned

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:55.790
It's kind of like Maslov's hierarchy of needs. It's what we need to do to be successful in knowledge work

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.310
So I'm okay with that. I don't call that egotistical

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:03.230
But it's if you give people work they enjoy that they feel like matters

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:08.410
They're going to do better work and create higher quality output. So I am all over that

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:15.320
Okay, good to hear that's good to hear as a much younger person than me. It's good to hear the younger generation

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:21.900
Figuring out that's important. So I like that. Yeah, I don't know if I figured that out of it's just really the

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.700
The awesome environment I was learning and we didn't have a scrum master, but we had

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.380
We had two people with scrum master certifications

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.940
my boss a really really great mind and

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.180
Always pointing out the the the problems

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.700
We had by by applying the scrum guide and saying okay

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:53.780
We have a problem with doing three weeks week sprints come let's try to let's try one. Okay, what is what? What is happening?

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.420
So he was basically a teacher coach mentor

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:04.060
And a great scrum master, but also the world shifted sometimes sometimes I was a scrum master and

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.260
He was focused on more on development. Sometimes someone else was

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.060
for the sprint

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.400
having trying to have more like an

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.820
overview about the the team and the the things we do

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.820
But that was very hard because we were all

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.860
developers and we all wanted to develop fancy stuff and great things and

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.740
Yeah, it's the focus sounds like a good boss excited about that

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.340
Hey one last thing I'd like to talk about which is the thing on everyone's mind these days

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:43.770
Covid so first off, how's it going with you with do you have a family you live by yourself?

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.770
How's it going with you dealing with?

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.930
Whatever is going on in your part of the world. I think in Germany things have opened up a little bit more but not much

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.930
Yeah, I mean it's

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:59.410
Comparatively good you see low numbers like thousands

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:06.070
But you see an increase now that schools and businesses are reopening again

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.730
Yeah, that was to be expected. I

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:15.110
Was lucky to to just have finished project and I could just go to the office

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.290
By myself or I could stay at home. I

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.610
Basically the whole April was on vacation

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.570
Yeah, and after that I was alone in the office

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.630
So no no contact there no risk. I have a wife I

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.890
Have a son who is going to be three years old

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.840
That's the really stressful part

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.120
Because yes, I have noticed that too

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.300
I have a lot of employees with young kids and I have had a lot of young kids join meetings

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.300
Which can be funny

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:59.920
but but related to the the risk of infection even even though the early data suggested that

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:09.020
children below a certain age aren't really suspect to the virus and don't face like severe consequences, but the long-term effects and

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.040
We have a grandma who couldn't visit

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.820
Yeah, and the soul

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.480
24-7 being a dad at home was quite a

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.780
challenge sometimes

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.780
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:30.540
So there is safety however in online communities and I believe you just joined LinkedIn recently

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:37.460
So what's that experience been like? Yeah, I thought because projects are slow. I just try to be more

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.180
active on LinkedIn, maybe

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.020
there's

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.100
Business value in that I'm quite

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:53.020
Surprised I'm it's already and it's already been proven valuable just to

00:21:53.940 --> 00:22:03.140
It's just funny learning aspect. I'm I discovered a lot of interesting people a lot of interesting thoughts and a lot of updates on my

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:11.860
Knowledge of scrum and some different philosophies and advancements

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.790
Try to to to get into discussions and maybe

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.950
post one or two things I'm really

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:28.330
Confident about that's not we hashed that's some of which no thoughts and hopefully helpful to someone

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.050
Yeah, engaging in discussion and debates are great way to learn. Yeah, definitely

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.530
Congratulations on on get now. I should have done. I should have done that earlier. Oh

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.980
It is what it is

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.820
Great. Well, that's going to bring us to the about to the end of our time here today

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:52.220
But I enjoyed the conversation especially kind of dive in to scrum a little bit and kind of hearing what's going on in your world

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.020
I want to thank you again for joining our

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:01.820
Community at one of the three dot slack comm and then for volunteering to be on this podcast where we try and get a little

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.180
bit more information around people on the podcast

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:11.620
So thank you for that and any final words or or actually maybe share some ways people can learn more about you or get a

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.620
Hold of you out in the real world

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.200
It's hard in the real world. You can you can connect to me on linkedin

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.440
but I don't really have an a

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:27.160
Channel a personal channel to spread my my thoughts and joined one of the three dot slack calm

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.440
Warming or global farming there. Yeah, and also on the Ministry of Testing podcast

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.800

Well, that's basically it. I think a lot of our community is bound to come across you at some point if they haven't already

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.930
Yes

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.930
It's good to have to remember

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.090
