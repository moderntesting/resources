00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:13.480
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.940
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey, Brett

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.890
Yeah, we're gonna do this again another remote because we want to observe the six-foot rule

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.910
AB testing podcast

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
Actually think this is all over we think you and I should continue to observe that

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.830
You know not a bad idea not a horrible idea. So how are things going?

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.110
How are you adapting?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.840
so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.040
the last episode we did actually was

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.440
rather helpful I spent a lot of time sort of thinking through and adapting to what

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.300
What sort of things can I learn from Alan who has?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.450
mastered this I

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.130
Would say like in my family my son

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.500
Adapted pretty quickly

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.260
He's 18 and school district says you don't have to do school. I mean that's enough information for him

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.900
He works at McDonald's so every morning

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.860
We get a hey dad. I'm essential and you're not

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.800
Sort of common wait

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.200
I I haven't really left the house and I haven't been to a McDonald's in forever

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.320
But McDonald's is essential. Yeah, cuz they provide food

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.650
No comment. All right, then did you see speaking of school?

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.150
Did you see the on April 1st the there was a mocks?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.990
There's a screenshot looked really real of Jay Inslee with the banner below saying

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.470
Governor makes the tough call to ask all students to repeat the 2019 2020 school year. I did not

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.010
Yeah, that's a that that caused a lot of kids that poop their britches

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.910
It's interesting. My daughter is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.790
Checking along. I mean the only issue with my daughter is I think that so she's been doing

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.270
Online for a great deal. She goes to private school. So she's not beholden to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.220
Inslee's statement or so Inslee at one point in time basically said all schools are canceled

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360
North Shore School District had online

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.640
That's where my son goes. They had online school going within

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.510
a week and then the governor's office said

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.390
Can't do that unfair to other districts

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.450
And so they did some wrangling got that back online that just started this week

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.310
but again my daughter private school the only issue there is

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.750
She normally had been doing school for like six hours a day, right and right now

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.710
Consistently every day at 10. I go. Okay. Are you done with school and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.540
She's like, oh, yeah, I've already turned in on all my homework assignments and everything and so I don't

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.140
feel at the moment I'm getting my

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.180
ROI of private school

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.220
Yeah, so my kids are in public schools, but they both go to a it's called the big-picture school

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.100
It's all project-based so they can do a lot of that from home and they're both

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.660
I'm what my Alan one second pause

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.140
What?

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.890
I'm doing a podcast go away. I'm gonna leave that

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.880
So it's a project-based school they able to do a lot of their stuff from home

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.360
My son is sporadically working on a python project. I help him with a little bit

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640
Making him learn get so I can send him

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.680
Pull requests for like I start things for him so he can finish them as a way to kind of get him going and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.240
That's plugging along. My daughter's doing a

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.810
She's pretty much done with all her schoolwork

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.800
But the point I was getting to is it's a gua. It was going to be where my kids go to school

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.710
They were going to be at a school till April 20th and then

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.310
Inslee extended that by two weeks. It's probably gonna be longer, but they're going to kick off

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.990
remote learning sessions

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.750
Beginning the week after their spring break would have been so it's all kicking in. I don't think they're going back to school this year

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.910
We'll see what happens

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.340
We'll see right I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.420
So first off many things

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.300
So first second third fourth and fifth off go ahead right

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.140
the you mentioned

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.740
Teaching your son Python or working through Python

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.650
There is a book. I got my daughter

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.490
Ten-year-old daughter called its head first as we both

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.330
Played we love that series. I do love the head first series

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.180
They have a sick they have a book called learning to code and

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.180
I have been doing this for about a month. We do a chapter a week with my daughter

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.100
She's she's about to start chapter four and learn about while in for loops

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.580
But those on the podcast can't see this

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
But I got this as a follow-up once my daughter

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.480
What he's showing me that it's a mystery it's porn no it's head first Python

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.050
Yes, so the learning to code book uses Python as its primary language

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.360
Forgot to mention that and then this one is far more in depth

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.720
Very very interesting. I will check both of those out and

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.030
Yeah, hey

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.630
So getting back on to a little bit more COVID then we have some kind of loose topics to discuss today

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.390
But I'm curious to talk about what's changed. Maybe I'll start

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.070
I'll tell you what's changed for me at work

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.990
You talked about me being an expert at working from home and I have more experience

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.220
Not necessarily expertise, but what's happened and I can't remember if I mentioned this last time is

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.780
It's learning to help everyone else learning to work from home has become a big part of my job and

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.420
That means you are a

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.660
Work from home coach now to

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.740
Apparently and it's some therapy too because I have some employees who

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.320
Live by themselves and they're going a little stir-crazy one in a in a apartment about as big as the office

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.180
I'm recording this in at home

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.780
So they have their own challenges. There are people with roommates who are slowly

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.180
learning to loathe their roommates

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.340
and and what

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.020
impacts them

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:02.140
Separation does make the heart grow fonder what impacts me the most is a lot more meetings on my calendar a

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.220
Lot a lot a lot. I have calendar explosion

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.300
It's good. I feel like

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:15.460
95% plus of those meetings are actually effective uses of my time just ends up being exhausting. I'm probably in meetings

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.740
I didn't count I was thinking of writing a

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.100
plugin

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:28.380
Extension to count how many hours and meetings I have a week, but I'm assuming it's somewhere near 40. Yeah, if you had

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.490
If you were still at Microsoft and you had

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.630
Outlook they have now a new analytics tool plugged in and

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.480
So like last Monday

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.130
The little plug-in sent me a mail and told me hey

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:50.940
You should look into this your meeting schedule has spiked up in the last week

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.590
Oh, yeah, that's that I kind of I can tell I can tell well

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.030
So here's the thing that's depressing because it will quantify it and it told me that

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.110
98% of my time now is being spent in meetings. I'm like, oh

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.620
kill me

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:15.300
The other interesting thing is there's some new meetings on my calendar that I don't always go to but they're interesting

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.020
We have regular yoga classes over zoom. I can attend

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.460
We have a happy hour every Friday virtual happy hour

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.620
Everyone drinks at their home desk and toast each other and chats about whatever little things like that

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.660
we have teams with discord servers and

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.400
One of my teams has a slack hangout not a slack hangout a Google hangout

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.480
they just keep running all day to pop in and out of and at work, you know, they all sit in a

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.720
all sit together in a little pod and

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.400
They're used to just having chatter with each other while they work and it gives them a way to emulate that

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.100
So a lot of things it's it's interesting to watch how people adopt in a company a gazillion times bigger

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.440
What's different about other than the media explosion would you I assume you've noticed what else is different? What do you what?

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.520
Do you and your team is doing to?

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.280
Handle the brave new world

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:15.100
So my experience is different than my reports. It's interesting because the majority of my reports are reporting in

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.590
So I have one kid that

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:25.890
He just joined us from college. I call him a kid, but he's he went to a PhD

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.990
So he's nearly 30. Yeah, my whole team are kids. It's alright

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.500
He's going stir crazy. He's an extrovert and he's like people

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:43.340
Yeah, the the rest of my team primary introverted and they're all reporting. Oh my god

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.140
My productivity is through the roof right? I've heard that too. I've heard that for most of my team

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.060
Yeah me

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.120
I'm as we've talked about many times before I'm introverted

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.680
By the way, I I had a meeting this week

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.320
We're doing more like get to know each other meetings over over zoom and I'm interrupting you because

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.000
one of my

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.320
Skip levels spoke up. He's a kid. One of the kids lives by themselves. He said and I'm an INTP

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.320
I thought as am I as we all are yes

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.320
All right. Go on as a manager, right? You have to compensate, right?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:32.160
You you you can't follow your instinct to avoid or kill all the people that you were interacting with

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.900
Crap, it's against the law. So you you learn

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.080
skills to compensate for this and even

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.950
how to fake

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.230
momentarily

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.230
being extroverted

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.870
but the meeting schedule is

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.780
tiresome

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.540
Right. It's it drains your battery really quickly and

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.980
You don't get to compensate or balance it out with actually getting stuff done

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.750
right, you know

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:13.790
Too much talky not enough Dewey in Prince life. Yeah, I think I've heard that. Yeah, I have

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.030
Honestly, and this this won't sustain long term

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.530
But for right now I've had to commit that I am just gonna have to spend

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:28.410
Four hours half a day on Saturday doing the stuff that I would normally have done during the week the Dewey part

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.860
I do my Dewey on Saturday

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.880
So I I do that on the weekends as well. It's essentially

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.520
as

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.760
My body clock no matter what time I go to bed I get up at I haven't set an alarm clock in forever

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.700
If I stay up too late that little aspect of my body clock drives me crazy

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.160
So I am very defensive

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.980
I need to make sure I go to bed on time because I know I'm getting up at five no matter what

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.800
Anyway, the nice thing about that is the majority of my family on weekends will sleep in until 10

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.630
like sweet

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.470
Actually when I get the work done I have this weird thing where if I

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.350
Most days I will wake up five or ten minutes before my alarm no matter what time my alarm set for I

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.530
Usually have meetings beginning at 5 30 or 6 in the morning

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:28.190
So I to get up at 5 or 5 30 every morning and I tend to wake up most mornings on my own on the weekends. I will

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.540
My body is able to sleep till 7 o'clock, but my family doesn't roll out of bed till about 10

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.020
so I have plenty of time after

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.520
Taking care of the dog and take the dog for a walk and making some coffee to get a couple solid hours in then

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.700
And that works out pretty well. Hormone. Yeah, what's your what are your team's doing at Microsoft to stay connected?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.280
Other than the typical day-to-day meetings

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.650
So I have a daily stand-up, right? I did I

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.330
Bring that up. I ask how people are coping how I can help

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.170
We are doing a more relevant today

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.690
with within my managers organization

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.930
That should be interesting

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:17.050
So as you know, typically with morale event that there's generally food involved and and some sort of activity

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.200
Just bring your own food

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.200
No, actually

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.240
so

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.920
Every member of the team yesterday got a $40 door dash

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.790
gift certificate and

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.790
We are all to

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.700
Schedule our door dashes

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.340
Make sure the food is there

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.080
by noon and then noon we will be eating and

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800
Playing some sort of game. Oh

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:56.070
Cool cool. We are there's a lot more virtual happy hours going on across teams some games

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:02.670
I've been playing a lot of exploding kittens over the Internet a little bit on board game arena. I just downloaded doom eternal

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.510
I'll be playing that all weekend

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.710
But a couple questions for you during this time. What book are you reading right now?

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.770
Not really much headfirst Dewey

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.440
Yeah, so the the closest thing to a book that I've been reading is

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.760
this one

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.520
Called math riddles for smart kids Brent is where this is why we shouldn't do recordings over zoom cuz Brent

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.840
Hold things up to the camera on a podcast. I

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.960
Think it's kind of fun. But yes, it's smart riddles for for a math riddles for smart. I like that

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.400
I like that. I like that. It's it's basically nothing but story problems

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.240
And I sit down with my daughter and we do a couple of them a day. Good. What games are you playing else?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.100
Not playing

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.780
anything again, here's what I would say is

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.250
Because the meeting schedule has gone way up

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.040
My drive if I have free time

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:12.500
I'm getting stuff done because that actually helps my my karmic balance better than

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.820
then

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.580
Then those other

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:22.270
You know normal relaxed time activities. Yeah, that's true for me as well

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.390
I wonder if it has to do a little bit at least with the personality type makes my son and I

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.780
Was interesting so

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.040
He has a girlfriend. He's going a bit stir-crazy

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.040
because of this

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.440
can't spend time with them and

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:47.910
He'll go up on Xbox and if his friends aren't there then he'll fall back to his plan Z

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.790
Which is oh, let's see if dad wants to do something

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.580
So we played a borderlands 3 for a couple hours

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.660
four or five days ago

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.600
But other than that, I mean there's nothing

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.540
Nothing to report on my side

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.030
you

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.030
Like I told I've been playing Ori and the will of the wisps. I

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.040
Kind of get

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.120
platformers end up frustrating me after a while

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:25.100
So I bought and downloaded doom eternal as I mentioned earlier last night and I'll be playing that this afternoon and this weekend

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.460
That's what doom doom our first person shooters in general was a good way to

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.060
Virtually act

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.020
On your introverted instincts. Is that true?

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.860
Right. Are you making crap in? No in in doom?

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.900
You are allowed to kill all the people now. You're killing you're not killing people. You're killing demons

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:55.740
Whatever big difference what's been other than the work stuff we talked about what's been the biggest change for you over the last two weeks

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.180
three weeks

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.060
finding a rhythm so so I

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.860
Am I own babysitting duty up until noon then we hand off to my wife

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.070
so finding a rhythm where I can kind of keep my

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.380
my day schedule

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.840
Sort of normal ish, but incorporating

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.380
helping my my daughter

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.190
That's been the biggest challenge like right now

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.930
So normally around eight twenty and it's eight twenty six right now

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.350
Normally around eight twenty. I have to stop whatever meeting. I'm in

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:42.190
Go get my daughter breakfast, but today she's having cereal and I have put it all out on the table

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.170
It's self-serve breakfast this morning. Yeah

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:52.930
Having teenagers as painful as it can be is an advantage at this time because they're largely self-sufficient

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:59.450
I have to give them some structure to make sure they get things done and other than that it works out pretty well

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.470
Yes, I just went and glanced at the table. It doesn't look like she's up yet

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.960
Yeah, oh, okay, I'm sure other stuff will come up but I am going to do a yet another

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.680
episode where Alan outsources his job to Brent

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.760
attempts to or looks for ideas and I am a big believer in the littuce Pauling quote that I mentioned probably

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360
10,000 times on the podcast

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.920
The way to get good ideas is to have a lot of ideas then throw the bad ones away

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.980
So I'm always looking for ideas

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:44.540
So you're welcome to send me things if you're listening if you're on the one of the three dot slack comm slack group

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.140
You can send them to me there

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.340
By the way, we don't have it on our slack

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.780
But looks like all the paid versions of slack have got the new slack upgrade. It's very slick

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.180
You can now put for those of us that have

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:04.860
Slack teams with lots and lots of channels. You can now organize those channels into folders or groups makes things very nice a

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.260
Little more organized. I was worried at first it made slack feel a little bit too much like email

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:16.460
But not too bad that should roll out to those of us mooching off the free version. I'm guessing in the next few weeks

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.540
So it's kind of cool

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.700
Anyway interesting. Does that mean?

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.580
So it's it's it's right. It sounds like

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:31.900
Slack is lighting it. I wonder if they're prioritizing their paid or if they're free just significantly

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:39.300
Outnumbers, they're paid. I'm sure free significantly outnumbers paid. I don't know if they're fighting I think it's been available

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.460
We just turned it on

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.300
So I don't know I'm not a slack admin on I haven't been contacted

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.700
I'm not sure how they're going to do for the paid version to contact an admin first and say hey when do you want this

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.580
Turned on for you and they do a little testing and then they say yeah

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.500
So anyway, I wanted to mention that because I like it

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:03.260
But give me feedback and the question for Brent and for everyone listening is this

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.070
Say for example, you knew someone

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.280
Perhaps who's speaking right now who was given the abstract task of

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.610
Increasing velocity on

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.340
Their engineering team or in their engineering organization

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.280
Knowing full well

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.440
Actually, this is weird talking on this way. So I have been asked to increase velocity for the team

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.800
with both parties knowing full well, there's no blueprint and

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:44.800
Velocity is an abstract term and that it has probably as much perception as it is actual execution

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:51.600
I have my own bag of tricks which has worked for a long time small batch size is probably the easiest one

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.320
both for perception and actual throughput

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:04.180
That along with a clear definition of done that focuses on that includes a focus on the customer problem

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.180
That's being solved by that work

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.500
Those two are my two go-tos

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:16.970
But I know enough to know that those two alone aren't a blueprint. What else should I consider if I wanted to

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.450
increase the actual and perceived

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.830
velocity or

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:30.550
I'll use the word velocity for now or put another way if you were the designated velocity champion

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.150
What sorts of things should you be doing or thinking about?

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.990
And I assume

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:45.260
Gaming the numbers is off the table. This isn't Microsoft. We actually do legit work here. Okay, so

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.620
You called out velocity versus

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.180
perceived velocity

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.860
So I can I can how do you think those are measured differently?

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:07.020
It's the communication of the velocity. It's a little bit not necessarily how to lie with statistics or game the numbers but

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.980
for example

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:15.340
When we I send I have a couple weekly meetings one with America's one with Europe where I go over

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.540
project status across the org

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:22.140
And just just focusing not on these 70 or so projects. We have a flight but just focusing on

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.310
the projects that have

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.310
some delays or some risk and the purpose of that meeting is

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.030
much less so on

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.340
The actual delays because they could just send me those in slack. It's

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:44.100
Really about emphasizing our culture of transparency and psychological safety and just learning from each other

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.860
I think the primary use of that meeting in my time in the group has moved

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:55.500
from sort of a status check to a meeting that covers that there's really about emphasizing our values as an org our principles and

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:01.010
However, however, however to answer your question. I had to proceed with that afterwards

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.510
I send it I send a brief set of notes to the whole org with

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:10.490
completed projects that week delays updates and new projects

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.510
One thing I did recently to address perceived

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:24.180
Velocity is I started I used to start the thing off with delays had delays and then completed and then new I did two things

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.180
To improve the perception of velocity exact same information one

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:34.300
I put completed at the top instead of delays at the top and

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:41.920
Then and then delayed and then I always have delayed with the reason but now I have delayed along with the mitigation step for that

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.600
delay with the idea being that

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.400
This is delay because team X was depending on team Y and they're waiting on whatever

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.460
Same reason extra sentence. This is being resolved and determine if it's a systemic problem

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:02.260
That should be solved at a higher level or whatever that it's a little bit in the marketing spin of the same information

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.140
That's what I mean by perceived

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.380
Okay in one way and that can be in a bunch of different ways

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.730
So right now if I interpreted that correctly

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.690
right that last thing is

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.090
your manager

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.430
Sounds like he actually reads your status report and I don't know

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:29.490
I mean he does but it's the other people that read it. So I I'm surprised that people actually look at this

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.570
It's just meeting notes. I wouldn't even call

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:40.510
Sort of a regularly read and structured email and if it framed delay at the top

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.150
You're puzzling through or had validated that

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.110
You starting the top of this with delay is

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:54.030
Artificially raising the focus on that that is my hypothesis. Yes. All right

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:59.070
And that's just one example. There's there could be more but I wanted to give you an example

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:07.340
Then if you put completed at the top, then the likely the next thing is is that your manager is going to so

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.180
Count the number of bullet items underneath that

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.260
Going forward is don't don't assume pointy Herodness

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:24.840
the idea is that I think my hypothesis is that I will improve the perception of velocity by focusing

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.800
first on the things that are done and then

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:36.240
Improving the information that goes along with the items that are delayed. All right, so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave the perception thing

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.520
aside for a moment because

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.230
I'm gonna actually before you do that

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:50.430
The reason I bring up the perception is often in the data we communicate the way this is true across velocity or quality or whatever

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:55.670
we're trying to get across the way we present that requires a little bit of

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:03.510
Spin whether you want to call it marketing or selling but this is common when you're distributing

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.420
distributing

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.100
Information to a large group when you have to consider your audience and your audience is vast

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.300
And well, you know will interpret things in different ways

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.420
Maybe I'll put this differently the larger your audience the more

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:26.740
Spin you may have to put on things to get across the the takeaway you want them to get

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.840
Yeah, I'm

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.760
from a

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.600
Sociological point of view sure spin is one thing

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.100
But you're the way you're describing the problem. I actually don't view it as

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.820
And I don't and honestly, I don't think I think perception is

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.900
is

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.100
Indicative of a problem with velocity. I don't think we're moving as fast as we can

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.720
I don't want to go fast and break things. I want to go fast and break as few things as possible

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.440
We'll break them in a very safe way as possible. I think sometimes we over plan

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.520
Sometimes we over test and those are the things I want to work on

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.640
But at the same time I work on the communication so that but again, there's little pointy Herodness in my boss

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.920
But there are leaders and other disciplines who look at this and and don't know quite how to interpret

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.920
So I want to communicate to them that

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:25.480
Again, this meeting is about and emphasizing the fact that we are learning organization that were very transparent

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.420
I want to emphasize in my communication that we are a learning

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.180
Organization for those that may not be as close to the principles as I am

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.260
So I think there is some truth to perceptions. I want to manage that but

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.980
But yeah, sure sure great

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:49.540
So anytime you're sending a broadcast and set us report type of thing. I tell people it's best to to view it

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:56.790
Almost like a slide deck right? Yes, of course. Do you want to put the

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:02.550
People are if you assume people are only going to spend a max of 10 minutes

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:11.030
Reading it. Yeah, probably less it then you want to want to put the price you want to put the high order bits at the

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.510
Top of the email and you want to be succinct? Yes

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:20.950
I think just to move along I think maybe we're focusing a little bit too much on the perception part you asked about it

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:25.230
And I want to give an example. Yeah, probably other ones, but I think I want to move on to the actual

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:32.750
Well engineering velocity and practice soon. Yes, so I'm gonna do that now because previously

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:40.790
So the best way to improve perceived velocity is actually to improve actual velocity. Yes

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.270
Yes. Yes. Yes. It makes sure it's

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.230
visible

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:52.670
Clearly, right you want you want to get the perception to align with actual so

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.080
How do you measure velocity today or do you?

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:02.460
The only thing I use now is lead time. I only look at things at the project level

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.620
So I can use lead time, which is a pretty good measure

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:12.660
But what I'm missing is what that doesn't get me. There are some projects for example that

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.790
their definition of MVP and my definition of MVP are

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.890
Different to some degree

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:30.050
And you know me, you know, I have a very lean definition of MVP

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:34.250
What is the minimum thing we can build that will let us get validated learning?

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:39.610
So on that one, I've had that conversation a million times

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.860
that is generally a

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:51.140
Discussion with the team and go MVP is not the new millennial version of the term beta

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.820
They're not soon. Yes. Yes, you're right

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500
And what happens is

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.900
So lead time is very much a trailing indicator for me. I can tell

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.340
Lead time of our projects I can tell how many projects were delivering a month

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:14.060
They're not all the same size, but it's in larger numbers. It makes sense, but it's all trailing indicators

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.540
The work I need to do is at the team level

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.940
So what I'm thinking of doing is trying to figure out what are some principles

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.940
We should apply across our engineering orgs to increase velocity batch size is one

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:33.220
But I'm probably getting too specific. I don't I want you to continue to comment. I'm just gonna steer you a little bit

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.300
So I gave you a very long answer to your question that I should have just said I

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.850
Know I know throughput at the project level and I know lead time

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.380
Yeah

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.420
So lead time

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:58.530
Translated to compound is what the the time the the the batch is in development

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:05.550
No, it's from it's from product hypothesis to customer reaction or customer feedback customer validation

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.530
Oh, that's cycle time. Oh cycle. Wait. All right

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:14.570
Got it. Well and and to be fair as I've read about this I've seen those terms

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.810
not quite interchangeably used but

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:24.330
Flopped and extended a bit. So thanks for clarifying. So this is not just development time. This is

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.180
Wait, I've always thought of those backward have I?

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.820
Anyway, it's this time like

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:36.580
We want to build this so that includes planning all the way to in the hands of customers

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:43.070
Lead I'm looking at so lead and delivery time often go hand-to-hand

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.390
They are the terms invented from the manufacturing

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.460
Okay, then I'm gonna go with them

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:58.570
Okay lead is the time that will take to process and prepare material produce and transport it to you the customer

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.130
Oh, okay. So lead time in that regard

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.490
Yeah

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.330
it's

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:12.010
So for example, we're dealing with this all over the place in the world right now

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.010
Manufacturing their lead times have gone way down, right?

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.130
Are way up?

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.010
I guess they've increased right if you need toilet paper

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:28.870
the the lead time to for producing toilet paper is

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:37.670
Has increased it will take longer to get it out to the customer as an aside. I was at the grocery store the other day

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:46.380
They actually had toilet paper. I didn't need it, but I felt obligated to buy one small pack anyway

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.820
You're part of the problem

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.400
I almost posted on Facebook

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.600
Achievement unlocked. I haven't bought toilet paper since this thing

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:05.840
Happened I didn't I honestly I didn't need to but I bought just a small pack

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:12.340
Anyway, alright good for you. Where are we? We're on a lead time tangent. Alright, so here's the thing

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.340
That I normally do

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.180
Okay, I think you're trying to do it from the top down

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.580
Which is the thing that's interesting for me because I'm trying to I normally do it from the bottom up. Okay

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.760
I work at the top. I need to go work with the bottom. So I do want to hear this

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:37.730
Theory of constraints right what you need to do is figure out how to apply the theory of

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.110
constraints at a useful macro level

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.160
Right. You need to identify

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.480
the very first thing that you need to do is

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.910
Visualize the process

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:59.150
In and obviously something automated is going to be great, but at your level

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.260
Like how to do it at the macro level is something I have not ever done

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.430
at the at the micro level

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:14.590
Right visualizing bottlenecks is easy. You put together a Kanban board

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:21.470
and you get useful columns going and you put whip in place and

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.270
The bot where the bottleneck is becomes really clear

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:31.070
Really fast. So one idea might be

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:33.950
Whatever your macro level thing is

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:39.080
Do you have the power to limit with?

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.820
No, I can plant seeds though

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.500
So I just talked about how our org works and it's interesting you brought that up because that's been on my mind as well

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.420
Maybe last month. We have a monthly get together of all of our leads and I usually take

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:58.620
across the world and I usually take 10 or 15 minutes and present something and

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:06.520
It's usually not very prescriptive, but I'm planting seeds and the thing I talked about in this one was

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:13.080
flow and cues and some lessons learned from Renaissance flow book

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:19.700
It sparked a lot of interest. I use that to segue into a talk on because talked a lot about

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:26.580
Q times I use that to segue into a brief overview about how you and I like to approach Kanban

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:32.860
well, which is really how to use Kanban properly and I the model I used was

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:40.820
People taking the default version of Kanban like the first board you create Kanban board has to do doing done

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:46.260
And I say this isn't really very helpful you and I have quite similar columns

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.380
I've used what you have built what you have built. I won't go into mall right now

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.900
but logical steps that show flow all the way from

00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.280
Things that can be done to things that are validated in production. I show

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:08.120
Why you know how that how that works and then I introduced whip which a lot of people using Kanban don't use and

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:15.320
I show how easy it is. Just some quick examples how like I just throw up a Kanban board. Okay, what's the problem here and

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.960
Immediately because human brains are fantastic at pattern matching. Everyone knows exactly what the bottlenecks are

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.360
It's amazing if you use Kanban and whip properly how powerful that is

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.600
not

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.600
coincidentally I

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.800
Did a query last night of I look a lot at all that our project data

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.830
I did a query of

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:47.720
every project that's been completed on time or early in the last since I joined the team in the last 10 months or so and

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:54.370
The delivery owner in charge of those projects all of our projects have a product owner

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:57.050
which is product management and a delivery owner, which is the engineering lead and

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.930
Would you believe would you be surprised that?

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.210
that

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:07.420
The people at the top of that list are people that I know from talking to them

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.910
Use Kanban and whip as part of their project management. I am not

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:20.330
And actually it's interesting. Maybe you have found a clue there. Yeah, there's something there

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.130
But here's here's a little bit of my challenge. Let me I need to get a little bit more of our culture

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.130
Then go on there. We have a very

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.420
We're very proud of our autonomous culture the the directions

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:35.980
We give our engineering leads if you have three jobs you need to manage people you need to be a tech leader

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.980
You need to do your own project management

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.220
How you do that is up to you

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:47.220
But when you do it you should balance that work is roughly 60% new stuff 20% keeping the business running 20% tech debt and

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.530
We give them like in very much in the spirit of oh

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.810
Who are the radical leaders guide to radical management the denning?

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.730
give people a framework they can work in and then get out of their way and

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.090
So I offer tips on

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:09.170
Why they may be using scrum or Kanban and effectively and slowly they get better

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:15.850
But that's kind of where we're at. So people get to choose. We don't prescribe a project management approach. I

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:20.250
Obviously have my preferences but in the way our org works

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.810
It wouldn't be fair of me to tell them what to do

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:29.370
I can get them suggestions on what may work better in their context as I work my way around our our

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.630
80 different engineering teams however many we have

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.420
Yeah

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.420
Okay, I get that so

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:43.760
So in addition to this we need to come up with a strategy that doesn't involve command and control

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.440
Yeah, and and I should also point out they do listen to me

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.260
So if I just sent an email or a slack message or presentation that said

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.460
Alan thinks velocity can be improved if we follow these three principles

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.040
They'll try them. Oh

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.120
So I will I can't prescribe but I've worked myself into a position of

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.180
Credibility where if I say stuff it won't be whatever shut up

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.300
So that there is that advantage

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.240
well

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.440
Right, if you were to say the principles

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.650
Let me try these right?

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.170
CICD obviously

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.300
pole and whip

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.360
right, I think

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.880
the those three principles or those three

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.560
acids techniques

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.560
thingamabobs

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.600
I don't care about the right now

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.080
that's the secret sauce of

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:56.080
Kombat to a great deal. I mean be the fourth one is visualize everything. Yes that helps, right?

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.040
But if you have a team

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.810
So if you initiated if you get teams to initiate whip

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:12.420
And then people are gonna come up with well, hey, I'm idle I can't pick up another ticket because

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.870
Whip

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.670
What do I do?

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:20.110
Right, then you you guide them towards pulling

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.020
right, and then the CICD

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.300
the best thing about CICD is

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:35.360
Is it's just fantastic inoculation into the primary?

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.300
Flaw with scrum in that is

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:46.180
All the bugs get integrated or get introduced into the product

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.460
The

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:55.260
11 p.m. The night before the end of spring demo. Yeah, even our teams using scrum though, however, I'm

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.180
90 plus percent of those

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:04.620
Their stuff when it gets to the done column is going into production. They don't really it's a it's a scrummer bond sort of thing

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.180
But we have CICD

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:13.020
Across the org that parts there. What we don't have is this idea of whip and I think it does I

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.580
think it is leading to

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.700
perceived an actual

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.140
slowness

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:24.570
so if you have if you have whip in place

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.890
then

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.050
Then that you need to make sure pull is in place and

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.920
and a lot of times when I say the word pull I mean the opposite of push

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.330
Not a long thing that you hang electric wires off of

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.120
Right so

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.120
Whip is really powerful

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.200
along with

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.160
pull

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.200
right

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.840
So there's a problem at the individual level

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.910
They're motivated

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.450
To start the next new shiny thing

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.100
Thanks for that

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:09.890
Wow

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:15.280
You'd make an attractive teenage girl. I don't know what you did

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.320
Brent's hallucinating. Yeah, Ellen is

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.440
Sorry tip of the day. Sorry to interrupt. I was goofing off listening to Brent

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:37.280
There's you can go to snap camera snapchat calm and you can get a filter that'll work in your video app

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.200
So you can change there's one where you can change yourself to a potato. It's pretty good anyway

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.360
anyway, so

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.140
once I get whip

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.340
Getting whip on a team because whip seems like what you're doing is you're setting up

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.620
artificial bottlenecks

00:42:54.620 --> 00:43:00.400
And it takes a little while to get people to understand know once once you have the white right

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:06.540
limits in place on your con bun board you should always have exactly

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:13.260
one column that's bottleneck if you have the right what lip limits in place and

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.880
It's great because that is Kanban telling you

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.810
Hey dive in here

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.250
It's it's all about

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:30.130
Creating an effective learning culture if you don't know where your bottleneck is

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:38.330
Start adding whip and cranking it down until something starts to slow

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:46.830
Absolutely, and I can offer this advice to the teams that are using who have chosen who have been nudged properly to use

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:52.700
Kanban as their project management. The second thing is you got you want to

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.220
You want to change?

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.500
the intrinsic

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.980
Motivation of each employee they're motivated to start the next new shiny thing

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:09.460
You want to change that intrinsic motivation to be around?

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.960
Closing is more important than starting

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:20.410
Finishing what is in flight is more important than starting something new and

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:29.260
What they what I when I get a team going into that particular rhythm and they successfully change that mindset

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:37.940
You discover something fascinating and that is that they realize they can actually start the new shiny thing faster

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.050
by focusing on

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.700
closing

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.540
Yes, and I feel like we may be pretty good at that

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.500
Okay

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.600
I think there may be and maybe you have true advice here

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.060
We're actually believe it or not getting close to the end of our time is

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.700
One thing I've discovered in looking at which projects have been successfully

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.310
Delivered and looking across hundreds of projects now

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.500
There is a correlation

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.900
Between and it's a little different Microsoft with program managers who were a bunch of different hats

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.700
but between our product managers our product owners and

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:21.760
Our engineering leaders the better alignment they have between the two of them because they're able to figure out

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.540
What exactly is they're building what problem? It's solving what a true MVP is

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.400
but the tighter that alignment is the

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:40.090
More velocity their teams have have you noticed anything like that or have any ideas how I could encourage that to work better

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.190
When you have

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:51.350
Teams that have a tight alignment. Here's how I phrase it my PM in engineering

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.900
Or development let me do that

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:02.060
PM in development they have different roles and

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:09.220
often the the power structure between the two of them is unbalanced and

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.160
the

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.440
the way I

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.120
Frame it is

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.800
They're my partner

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:27.420
And what I expect from a partner is that they are is as concerned about my goals as they are

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.500
their goals and their goals are

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.190
not my goals

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.580
Meaning we have we have overlapping so some PMs go

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:44.100
Do your goals are what I tell you to do. Here's the requirements that go do it, right?

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:51.680
That doesn't work though. It does not work, but there are there there are some

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.000
Thankfully, it's rare, but there are some PMs that are

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.470
Power tripping

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.600
So I sit down with my PMs and I go look

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:08.660
This is my definition of a partnership if you want to be my partner. It's not by words

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.700
This is what this means means you and I will

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:18.060
Consistently sync up around what my goals are and what your goals are and we're going to have a conversation

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:25.420
That results in both set of goals of being equally cared about by both sides

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.580
That is a partnership. Yeah, right and

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:35.740
Why do you have it a pushback? Why do you you want both sets of goals to be like how come you just can't have one set

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:40.140
Of goals between you because the goals are gonna be different

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.340
Right, they're gonna have something very PM focused as well on their list

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.740
No, the screw that screw that your come your goals together are to solve a customer's problem

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.120
That's nice as a t-shirt model

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.000
But on any level of drill down

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:04.280
It falls apart pretty quickly every human being has intrinsic goals. They have things that they want to achieve

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.560
Hey, let's say you were my PM and hey, you're like, hey, this is the right thing for the customer and

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.520
You know what you're really trying for a promotion

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.520
Yeah, we we'd right that that's a Microsoft thing

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.660
There are always

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.060
intrinsic in and extrinsic goals

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:29.900
I believe that people are trying to improve people are trying to grow but

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.780
The first thing you do is realize that users come first

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.610
How are we gonna solve that problem on the engineering side?

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:43.050
You help figure out what's the minimal amount of work we need to do to validate whether we're solving that problem or not

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.150
Agree on that implement it rinse lather repeat

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:54.800
Yeah, so I've definitely come from the engineering management point of view and as you know with my experience like

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.440
more often than not

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:04.720
Nowadays I'm more of a I am my own PM right? I already have the lather risk repeat

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.360
I know how to get feedback from the customers. I know how to

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.240
Use the data

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.690
So it's generally not a problem. Yeah, I

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:18.610
Work with no PM's on the teams. I manage. I just want to help the rest the other

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:22.210
240 engineers in the organization be successful

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:25.890
So before we run out of time there's one last

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:33.220
Concept that I wanted to bring up on your other question and that's the identification of waste

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:39.260
Do you have the ability do you understand this concept? Yes, absolutely. This is all over my

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.860
presentation I gave a month ago on

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.140
lean and writer's and

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.660
So if you can identify

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.140
So I have a particular style of a retrospective

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.420
We definitely do not have time to go through it

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.700
where you where you can

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.860
Force teams to understand what waste is and

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.140
Visualize it in a retrospective

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.240
But the more you can make that part of a culture and make each individual realize

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:18.000
Realize on their own that the effort that just spent on it could have been reduced by n number of days

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:26.780
You then get that learning in that pre-thinking done

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.340
Going forward

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:35.510
Right. You got to get rid of any sort of semblance of a blame culture

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:39.750
I have no doubt that that's pretty thriving not blame culture

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:49.590
Non-blame culture, I think is thriving at unity based on how you describe it in our org psychological safety is definitely something that both my manager

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.790
And I make sure is a top priority. Yes

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:56.060
So once you get through that then getting people

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.950
through

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:02.910
trained on at a ground level how to

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.530
use a retrospective to identify

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.410
sources of

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:12.400
waste

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:17.120
As a way to learn what to do next time because turns out

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:24.770
Very specific causes of waste are very rare. It almost always generalizes

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.920
that

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:31.800
That is actually a good brain tickle that last bit you brought up because

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.620
I've talked a lot about with my teams around I call them my teams

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.860
I consider the whole org sort of dotted line report to me

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:45.020
Whether they do or not, but we talked about

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:50.970
Waste and cues and whip and all these things

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:54.770
but one of the things I haven't planted enough seeds about and I

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:59.940
Talk a lot about planting seeds and leadership and just kind of mentioning things and see who picks up on it

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.740
My org is very fertile

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.610
They like when I plant seeds they pick them up, but I'm surprised sometimes

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:10.950
Hey, Alan, I tried this thing you mentioned it's working. I thought that wasn't even my main point

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:17.590
But yeah, and I haven't planted enough seeds yet around the power of retrospectives

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:18.700
and

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:23.180
that may be one of the next things I talk about with the team and start planting because that's

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:29.260
That's where the improvement happens. We have a learning culture and most or probably all the teams do retros

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:34.060
But are they effective retros that focus on not just on?

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.920
bugs or issues that came up or

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:44.400
Conflicts but make sure those retros include ideas on improving velocity or

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.200
identifying waste or cues would be

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.840
Right so

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.690
Retrospective and

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.050
You know said not be a postmortem

00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:04.050
It right right and I I don't think they're that but I think I can nudge those to being a way to scale some of this

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:11.610
Knowledge and we are going to spend our next podcast talking quite a bit more about retrospectives whether you know it or not

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:15.780
I just put it in slack. What do you think about that? I think that's fantastic

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:22.400
All right. I will will have forgotten it. All right. I better get going

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:25.670
All right

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.750
Alan is now mr. Potato

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:32.110
I have become a potato for Brent and hey, it is good chatting with you glad things are going

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:34.830
Well, please stay healthy and that message goes to

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.510
Brent as well as the rest of our listeners

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.820
All right. All right. I will see you. Thank you
