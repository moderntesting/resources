00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.130
Hello everybody.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.950
Hi.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.790
I'm Alan.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.610
I'm Brent.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.530
And we're back for episode 43 of AED testing.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.530
We are back after a break.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.130
I apologize again for the audio yuckiness

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.850
in the last episode.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.230
Hopefully it is better this time.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.210
I have upgraded some equipment to try

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.730
and make it Brent proof.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.770
That implies that the audio yuckiness was due to me.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.610
Well, some of it was.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.050
And I believe it was your channel that went offline.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.250
We had multiple issues, multiple issues.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.290
When you try and take my little weak signal and amplify it,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.130
I end up amplifying some of Brent's microphone stand

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.210
fondling.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.850
I have fondle proof at the microphones.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.690
And the Darth Vaderism, that's what bothered me the most.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.620
I'm like, wow, I really should go check out my breathing.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.010
Yeah, hopefully this one is better.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.270
So what's new with you, Brent?

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.850
I have just come back from Kauai.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.730
Nice.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.090
It was.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.130
Have you been?

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.410
I've been to Maui.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.910
OK.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.680
I've been to Kauai.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.360
Unless you're an outdoorsy guy, there's

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.160
not much to do in Kauai.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.040
Sounds fun to me.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.600
We're not outdoorsy people.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.080
Oh.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.600
But there are beaches in Kauai.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.440
And we are definitely beach people.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.360
I spent at least 50% of my time in the ocean.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160
My favorite story was I was out.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.240
You're as pale as ever.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.800
So you must have had some good sunscreen.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.160
I am not as pale as ever.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.200
Slightly less pale.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.040
I am golden brown and delicious.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.150
My best story is I was out snorkeling with my younger son.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.150
14.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.530
This is only his second time ever he's been snorkeling.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.890
And the first time, he was like eight.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.710
And the waves were pushing him around.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.710
This time, I was following him.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.830
I was a good father paying attention of his son.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.670
And suddenly, he just starts freaking out.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.990
So father syndrome kicks in going, ah, crap.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.990
I'm going to have to punch a shark in the nose

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.630
or some bullshit.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.440
And he was actually freaking.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.680
He starts pointing.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.880
And he was swimming right next to a giant sea turtle.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880
Oh, that's cool.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.780
That's way cooler than punching a shark in the nose.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.140
It would.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.420
Surviving punching a shark in the nose

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.100
would probably be a much better story in a UB podcast.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.140
But as we kept on swimming, we discovered

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.100
we were actually stuck in, I don't know what you call

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.340
a group of them, but a swarm of sea turtles.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.940
There was like 10 of them.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.420
And that rocks.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.300
It did rock.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.860
Just to amp up the drama just a little bit.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.120
You're not allowed to touch the turtles.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.680
They're an endangered species and touching them equals bad.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.560
But so it was a real challenge when you're stuck

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.560
in a swarm of these things, battling the waves

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.720
and making sure, because the waves kept on pushing me

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.200
towards the sea turtles.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.640
Anyway, there you go.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.400
Very cool.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.900
It was fun.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.820
Nothing new with me, but there's something new with A.B.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.500
testing for episode 43, something brand new.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.900
So we have a sponsor for episode number 43.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.460
My good friends at Star West asked if I'd give a plug

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.900
for their upcoming conference, and I'm going to do it.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.860
Because if you look at all the conference talks

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.220
I've done over the years, one conference I've done

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.540
way more than any are the Star Conferences.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.340
And in fact, I've probably been to more Star West

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.780
conferences than any others.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.220
Huge fan of Lee Copeland helped put together that conference.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.060
I just enjoy the crap out of it.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.620
And I make, I'm not, obviously not doing this Star West,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.500
but I'm trying to get back down there again.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.060
I kind of like going to the conference near Disneyland.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.260
It's kind of a lot of fun.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.460
Is it in LA?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.380
It's in Anaheim.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.340
It's in the, it's, actually I didn't look up the hotel.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.460
Usually every time I've gone it's been

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.340
in the Disneyland Hotel.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.540
This is, as far as speaking goes, I've enjoyed it

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.860
and I encourage A.B. testing people to go.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.980
If you're looking for a conference to go to,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.380
looking for a way to connect with testers.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.300
The talks, there's a couple of great keynotes.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.420
Jason Arbin from Applause.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.260
Do you ever meet Jason?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.100
No.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.660
Jason helped James Whitaker write the book

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.420
that was ripped off of my book,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.260
the How Google Test Software book.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.540
Oh.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.860
So he's at Applause, but he is a really smart guy.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.700
Does a great job.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.870
Jeff Morgan, also awesome.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.270
Tons of track speakers.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.070
And what I encourage people that go to these conferences

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.070
to do is, is you get some value and learning and ideas

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.950
from the speakers.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.790
It's not like you're gonna get every single word said

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.950
or things you're gonna take home and apply directly,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.110
but you're gonna find nuggets, dozens if not

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.310
hundreds of nuggets, but some of the best learning happens

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.230
at these conferences.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.030
For me, and for pretty much everyone I've talked to

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.470
is in just talking with other people at the conference

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.910
and getting a chance to talk to some of the speakers

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.750
one on one after their talk in the hallway at lunch,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.630
at the pub, whatever.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.070
It's a great way to learn.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.390
So that's where I get the value out of conferences

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.270
is from just talking to people

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.360
and learning from each other.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.660
So I have not ever been to any of the stars.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.660
Back when Whitaker was a prominent keynote speaker,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.640
he's invited me a couple of times to Star East,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.560
but it never was convenient for me

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.740
to go all the way to Florida.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.480
Getting knowledge around current techniques,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.500
I have seen particularly Lee is,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.660
of the leaders of these conferences

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.140
that I have visibility to,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.140
Lee is paying attention to the data movement,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.820
the agile movement, and he's not fighting against it.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.780
Absolutely not.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.070
And there are, again, you need to take everything

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.310
with a critical eye.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.870
Everything you learn whether it's from a conference,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.910
from a book, from an article, from a blog, from Twitter,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.070
you need to apply critical thinking

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.910
is how you decide what's worth learning

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.790
versus what's not learning.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.710
So you need to apply that always.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.470
Blind faith or blind, like, oh, what you said must be true,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.270
is a recipe for disaster.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.890
So that's with that caveat in mind.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.710
So Star West is, I'll give a little plug now,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.730
now that Brent is totally taking us off the rails,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.950
but Star West is, I think,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.770
one of the longest running test conferences out there.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.450
And this year it's in October, October 2nd through 7th.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.010
It's in Anaheim.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.830
I'm going to assume Disneyland Hotel,

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.560
although I did not look that up.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.560
There are over a hundred sessions.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.320
One thing about Star is they run massive concurrent tracks.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.840
So you can always find something.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.040
And one thing I encourage,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.240
and Lee will encourage you to do as well,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.440
is if you go to a talk and it ends up

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.680
not being what you want, it's okay to leave.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.040
Don't throw up your arms, go, ugh, and leave,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.560
but it's okay to go check one out.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.100
And sometimes if there are one or two or three talks

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.160
I want to see all at the same time,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.560
I will plan to rotate through them,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.240
try and get the best knowledge I can.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.680
So there is great information

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.440
and everything from test automation.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.140
There's a bunch of stuff on agile testing,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.360
perf testing, leadership, et cetera, tons of junk.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.640
And then I mentioned networking as the way to learn.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.960
And they have, in their expo,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.560
they have a bunch of exhibitors, I think like 50.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.200
You can speak one-on-one with the speakers,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.960
get some free consulting.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.400
Even more, there's a full day session on,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.520
a bonus session, Women Who Test,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.560
which I think is really cool.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.400
And a great way to,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.970
another great networking opportunity for women who test.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.010
Hey, Brandt.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.170
It gets even better.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.930
So AB testers, if you want to go to the conference,

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.570
do you like to save money?

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.650
Who doesn't like to save money?

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.130
I love saving money.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.530
So if you, you can, believe it or not,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.130
and not maybe applicable,

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.130
but if you go to the Star West site

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.250
and you sign up for the conference

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.850
and you want $200 off,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.770
just enter the promo code AB testing.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.690
I've never had my,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.330
I don't think I've ever had my own promo code before.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.170
Me, but either.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.210
It fills me with glee.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.210
It really does.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.670
So I'll post a link.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.990
It's well.tcwaxstarwestab.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.990
I'll post a link to that.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.550
And I encourage AB testers who,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.950
looking for a conference to go to, to attend.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.270
And I have confirmed that it is at the Disneyland Hotel.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.830
Yeah, I didn't want to make an assumption,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.030
but thank you for confirming that.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.950
It is at Disneyland Hotel.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.750
I'm really not going to try and edit that in.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.790
Great conference.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.390
The AB testers can find some value there

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.110
and use that discount code to save you

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.950
or your employer a few bucks.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.630
What's the discount code again?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.150
AB testing.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.590
All one word.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.510
You know what that's worth?

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.830
$200, $200 off.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.670
Sweet.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.710
Thank you Star West.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.550
All right, man.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.950
Thank you for our first

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.270
and potentially our last ever sponsor.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.990
Okay, moving on.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.190
So our good friend,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.650
I wouldn't call him a good friend

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.110
because I don't know if we have any good friends,

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.230
but our one of the three, Danny Thott.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.510
Software Alchemist posted just this morning last night.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.990
I just saw the post today.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.190
So did I.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.170
And I wanted to talk about a few things in the post

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.430
because he gave us a shout out.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.830
And the post is about the demise, the fadingness.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.670
What does he call it?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.250
A black box testing.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.490
Brent's learning how to operate

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.190
his mechanical electronic device here.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.190
The name of the post,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:23.020
the black box tester role may be fading away.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.100
And we could have a long discussion

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.700
about the truth and non-truth of that.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.810
I think it's definitely true in some ways and not in others.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.110
For example, on, you know, I am not a black box tester.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.550
I do a bunch of different things,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.690
but I employ black box testers.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.090
I was trying to think through the last time

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.550
I had a black box tester as an employee.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.370
Yeah, and these are vendor positions.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.210
And it might be measured in decades.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.830
I don't know that all teams would need a black box tester.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.280
I think, I think it'd be, again, a long discussion.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280
Happy to have it.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.560
Maybe not today.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.970
Cause what we really want to get to is

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.210
Danny gives us a little bit of a shout out.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.050
Yes.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.610
So can you read what Danny says?

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.130
Yes, and thanks Danny for the shout out.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.970
Of course.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.410
What Danny says is I have been following

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.450
Microsoft employees, Alan Page and Brent Jensen

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.330
on their AB podcast.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.170
That's us.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.070
The AB testing podcast.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.590
They have had fairly traditional testing roles

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.990
and are now in roles that seem much more future proof.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.750
Brent is now a data scientist,

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.950
specifically principal data scientist manager.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.270
Alan, principal software engineer

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.710
describes himself as a helper,

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.710
doing odd but challenging tasks

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:55.140
that don't easily fit the developer roles on his team,

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.120
which is something that appeals to me, Danny.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.280
Both are still involved in the testing process.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.160
The project structures they describe

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.300
seem to be on the leading edge of the future

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.400
of the software testing role.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.920
In my limited view of the software industry,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.260
I don't see many companies that are anywhere near

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.560
Microsoft in their evolution.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.520
If the traditional black box tester role is fading,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.160
I think it's going to happen very slowly.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.260
I think it will require a very broad view of the industry

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.460
to track a slow evolution like this.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.740
And I'm curious if you've heard from anyone

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.880
who is in a good position to see it.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.240
Danny does have a caveat there.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.280
He says in his limited view of the industry.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.340
I think Danny actually has a fairly non-limited view

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:46.630
of the industry, yet I'm going to say it right here.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.850
I'm glad you think that Brent and I

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.450
are on the leading edge of the future.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.570
I'm going to get the words wrong here,

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.570
but I don't think Microsoft is anywhere near the forefront

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.610
on how unified engineering or how to function

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.340
in an org without black box testers.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.180
No, I-

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.240
My org is because I'm awesome, but Microsoft as a whole.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.900
No, even I have a ways to go, I think.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.240
I would say like us being on the,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.680
Microsoft being on the leading edge here.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.230
When I read that in this post,

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.250
it kind of took me aback a bit.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.930
Alan and I have been talking on this topic

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.290
in various different communities

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.130
for it seems like five years now.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.770
Okay, for the record, I don't think you have to drink

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.550
for that one, that was well put.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.390
Thank you.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.420
All right, go on.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.520
And when we first started talking about this,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.570
we, much like I think Danny is doing referencing us,

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.630
we were talking about other companies

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:54.630
that we were aware of that were pushing

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.230
the boundaries and leading this edge.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.070
Like when, like we've talked about,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.950
I'll go ahead and drink.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.070
He's drinking coffee for the record.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.690
Yeah, make believe Irish.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.550
We've talked about it on the podcast

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.630
that not all of Microsoft has really moved

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.490
towards this transition.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.680
Although I, except for vendors,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.170
like I can't think of a single team

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.850
that employs a full-time black box test area at Microsoft.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.690
Oh no, absolutely.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:35.690
I'm 99.99% positive that they don't exist at Microsoft.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.730
I would tend to agree.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.730
And if they do, it's an extremely rare context sensitive

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.310
situation.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.380
So when Microsoft gets accused of the leading edge,

00:14:54.580 --> 00:15:00.220
what happens to me is I go, but we're so far behind.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.220
Yeah, that's the way I feel too.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.030
I see a lot of companies really better at this,

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.830
better at doing, like I'm trying to work my team,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.910
for example, towards continuous deployment.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.750
Yep.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.630
Which requires such a high level of daily quality

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.990
that we, and I know plenty of other companies do this,

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.710
plenty of other companies bigger than

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.790
and with more baggage in some cases

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.790
than what my team has, but they're able to pull that off.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.910
They've made it farther.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.270
I still feel like I'm chasing where I think we need to be

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.070
to be a good 21st century software engineering team.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.190
I do, I spent some time thinking about

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.610
why do I feel this way?

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.270
And we've heard from other of the three

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:52.200
around things like, oh, we are isolated,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.920
Microsoft environment isn't like everybody else, right?

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.760
And that may in fact be true.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.370
The thing that as I was thinking through

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.330
about what could be the difference between my perception

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.800
and say Danny's or other listeners perception.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.400
And one of them I thought about is all the companies

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.640
that I know of that don't employ testers,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.340
the vast majority of them never had testers to begin with.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.500
Absolutely true.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.700
So it's very possible we're leading

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.400
on the executing this transition.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.780
Yes, and that's actually a good way to put that.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.480
Nice insight there, Brent, because I think that

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.560
the transition is something that we've struggled with

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.260
and sometimes done well, sometimes done poorly,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.440
but it's that transition that's really hard.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.600
And to be clear for any first time listeners

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.360
who haven't heard this before, nothing to drink.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.240
These companies that don't have testers or teams

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.520
that don't have testers, they still guaranteed,

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.980
still have people focusing on quality

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.680
or focusing on testing activities.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.300
Those things still happen.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.800
So I don't want anyone, every time we say no testers,

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.120
I feel like I have to remind people that means

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.640
it doesn't mean no testing.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.440
That is correct.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.510
Like, and we're proponents of it on the podcast.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.210
There is a new balance that you need to strike

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:43.420
in terms of preventative care of your software.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.700
And in my humble opinion, it's just simply

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.940
more productive and more efficient

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.970
to have the testing tasks accomplished

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:04.130
by a specializing generalist versus a single individual

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.450
whose sole duty is to be paid to do that testing.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.290
Yeah, I agree.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.890
I think, and Danny talks in that article about,

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.930
and even he references Kim Caner's article

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.090
talking about the need to pick up some programming skills

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.990
or some, doesn't be programming,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.310
could be technical skills.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.270
I'm looking for someone from my team,

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.210
not necessarily to do programming,

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.750
but someone who is a wizard with configuring websites

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.210
and deployments and Azure site management,

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.470
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.510
And it's technical, it's not coding necessarily,

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.130
but it's critical to have.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.890
And those people that can do that

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.270
and keep an eye on quality,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.910
I think they're as good as gold.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.110
You can stay employed if you have a breadth of skills.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.770
The one thing that Danny has talked about

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.700
that I do think is,

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.420
so I got a LinkedIn message

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:09.260
from one of our listeners in India.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.640
You wanna take a stab at the name?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.840
Looks like a Polish name.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.280
Ewa, it could be Eva with a W, Barzakoska.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.560
We'll go with that.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.600
Working in India.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.640
Yep.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.240
Barzakoska. Barzakoska.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.240
Barzakoska. Barzakoska.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.240
And she sent me a LinkedIn connection invite thingy.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:37.930
Okay.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:38.770
A linker?

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.390
Yep.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.830
And wanted to be able to ask questions,

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:49.080
but in her last message sent the following.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.240
Hey, Brent, you know, one thing I really liked

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.640
that I had not had enough characters in the invite

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.440
to express is that you guys are still learning.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.120
One of you mentioned taking a MOOC in analytics.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.320
Do you know what that is?

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.390
No, master of occupational crime.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.550
Yep.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.390
And I'm learning to code right now

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.350
and from time to time,

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.350
I also take MOOCs and find it really encouraging

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.090
to hear that people who are already established

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.990
in their industry spend their free time

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.950
learning new things to stay relevant.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.380
I wonder if OC is online course.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.220
It might be.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.900
Something cause I do, I'm not always doing one,

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.460
but I frequently do online courses

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.540
in things I just need to know more about to feel relevant.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.100
But to hijack the thread here.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.420
Well, so I got to the,

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.300
then she goes on to discuss how awesome the podcast is.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.620
I'm blushing.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.810
So thank you for the feedback.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.570
But the point that Danny and Eva, Eva,

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.240
sorry about is.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.160
Who by the way, no longer likes the podcast,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.760
given our butchering of the name.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.200
Yeah, I hugely apologize for that.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:24.860
Is it's really important to have a sense

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.060
of what you need to grow into?

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.290
Yeah, and so first off, the easy part is

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.810
if you're in your job and you think,

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.270
I'm pretty good at this, I'll just keep doing this,

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.850
no need to learn anything else,

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.570
either at best career stagnation,

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.970
but at worst career limiting or more likely career limiting.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.730
But there's that challenge of what should I learn

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.650
and how much of it should I learn?

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:56.320
And that's a contextual and an experienced thing.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.000
I read this book maybe as long as 20 years ago.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.960
I think it was on management or leadership.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.120
And one of the things that suggested

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.720
is that you should always look for ways to learn.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.800
Like read, give examples of magazines.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.280
And don't worry if they're not in your field

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.720
because you'll pull ideas from them.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.840
That breadth will allow you to connect things

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.840
in the way that Steven Johnson,

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.120
in where good ideas come from

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.160
talks about that network effect.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.280
And so for about five years,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.800
I subscribed to this little 12 page magazine

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.560
called Science News, which came every week

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.400
or every two weeks.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.220
It was the most fascinating thing in the world.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.620
Nothing to do with testing,

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.520
nothing to do with software engineering.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.370
Occasionally about technology,

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.690
but it was, imagine like scientists doing active research

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.550
could publish not in the boring academic way,

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.910
meant for people like me to read,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.830
articles on their research every couple weeks.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.270
It was a great outlet for them, I imagine.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.090
But just, it was some of the best advice

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.710
I'd ever been given through a book in my life.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.690
But I learned just enough.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.850
It tickled my brain enough to make me want,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.690
to give me some expansion.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.970
But as far as learning, look for online courses,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.450
look for things you think you need to know more about.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.370
Sometimes, I can't remember why, I remember why.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:30.370
When Microsoft was making this move towards data science

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.810
and data analysis and business intelligence,

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.170
I wanted to be ahead of the curve.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.650
So the reason I'm able to fire off,

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:40.510
Brent always freaks out,

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.090
Brent is a real data scientist,

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.110
freaks out when I fire off mathematical terms

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.930
or data science terms in the right context

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.450
and make them make sense.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.410
I've gotten used to it, but I would say-

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.290
It does freak him out, and it's because-

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.770
When he tells me he's gonna go present

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.890
how to do A-B testing to a workshop of hundreds of people,

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.730
that freaks me out.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.130
And then I tell him what I'm doing,

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.990
and he goes, oh, okay.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.850
Because I took the time to go through courses

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.250
and reading and videos to learn how this stuff works.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.170
And then if you wanna make sure you know something,

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.750
the best way to make sure you know it is try and teach it.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.640
So if I can, it's one thing just to repeat things I've read,

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.000
but that works great as long as there are never any questions

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.880
and as long as I can explain it perfectly.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.860
But you have to teach something,

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.880
you have to know it well enough

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.080
to understand the nuance and how to-

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.480
And the other thing I would add-

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.320
Yeah.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.160
You should target teaching it,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.400
and you should target applying it.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.280
Yes, that's absolutely true.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.480
But the reason, and I'll finish up here,

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.800
but the reason I learned those things,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.440
I wanted to know them and I wanted to know them well enough

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.160
to be able to teach them to other people.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.560
I think there's some valuable things in there.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.320
So that's how I figured out how much I had to learn of it.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.600
So I could teach it to other people.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.160
There's an old phrase,

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.160
and that is the only constant in life is change.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:16.160
And back in the day when I had my first management job

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.880
here at Microsoft,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.680
it occurred to me pretty quickly

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.280
that in the software industry,

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.820
we change much more frequently

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.440
than most industries I'm aware of.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.580
And I discovered very quickly

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.460
that the people who did best

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.870
were not those who learned to survive change,

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.180
but thrived on it.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.340
And learning new things,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.770
getting ideas from other industries.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.610
I'll give you a recent example

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.200
of something that I'm working on.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.390
I run a service organization,

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:06.390
and I'm busily spending a lot of time reading white papers

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.060
on healthcare.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.000
And the primary reason why is most services

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.960
have some form or another of signals,

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.800
often referred to as pings or heartbeats

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.170
around how well the service is operating.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.110
Well, the healthcare industry

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.750
also spends a lot of time worried about

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.550
how well heartbeats are operating.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.390
And they've done a lot of advances

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.570
around near real-time analytics.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.530
So I'm reading a lot of these white papers

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.890
and mapping several of their efficiency concepts

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.130
into something that's service-based.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.250
It reminds me, one of my bachelor's degree was in math.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.930
And one of the few things

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.450
that have stuck with my math degree

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.410
was this concept of a mapping function,

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.010
where if you knew how to prove something

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.090
in one environment,

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.120
but you're in a different environment,

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.840
you could map from environment B

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.200
to environment A, do that work, then map it back.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.000
It's kind of the same thing with these concepts.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.400
Healthcare, yeah, they're worried about real heartbeats,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.850
but you can map it to a more technical concept,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.060
use the same solution.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.300
In terms of learning, I would recommend people to

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.540
not only look for online courses,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.500
I would spend 30% of your time

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.730
just looking for things that are,

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:53.610
you have no idea if it's going to apply,

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.170
and then spend a good portion of those things

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.760
that are something you've never done,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.020
but you have a 50% confidence you can actually use it.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.060
One of the things I got from,

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.180
I mentioned the science news story earlier,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.940
the little thin magazine,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.260
one of the things I got from that

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.700
was exactly what you're talking about.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.520
It's nothing to do with software,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.280
but every once in a while,

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.880
I would find something I could map.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.000
I wasn't looking for it,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.940
I just read it because it was interesting as hell,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.080
but I was able to find,

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.040
it tickled some ideas and it may not even be direct.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.880
It may not be like,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.920
oh, I can use this plant genome mapping

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.200
to figure out software, no,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.520
but the ideas would tickle something.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.000
And I think if you want to stay on the edge

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.200
and you want to really advance your career,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.940
and for me, if I'm not learning,

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.700
I am just bored as hell.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.820
I have to be learning,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.780
I have to be learning something new.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.900
So I think that's why I'm still employed,

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.130
even though my degrees are in music, perhaps.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.010
I know it's why I am.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.910
The last thing I'll say on this topic is,

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.430
I know what really spawned this for me.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.890
You mentioned your, what was it, science news.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:15.270
For me, what inspired this was really reading two books.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.650
Number one,

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.490
Green Eggs and Ham.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.330
Nope.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.330
Christopher Alexander's book,

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.990
The Timeless Way of Building,

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:35.990
as well as, you know the head first series of books?

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.870
The head first design patterns book.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.430
That's a very good,

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.070
that became my favorite book on design patterns.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.470
Even if you don't know coding very well,

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.190
I would recommend the design patterns book

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.590
because what we're talking about,

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.430
like in my healthcare example,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.570
and the example you just gave,

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.670
what we're really talking about

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:02.770
is universal process design patterns

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.130
that apply in a context free fashion.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.090
You know, that's a really good example

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.050
or recommendation for,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.650
you know, testers talking about being technical.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.690
I better learn to program.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.850
I better take a course in whatever.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.420
But as far as breadth goes,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.340
and specializing in generalists,

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.820
that head first design patterns book

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.820
is maybe a great recommendation

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.500
as one of the first few books you learn

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.420
is you wanna just start broadening.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.260
Yeah.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.080
It's really good.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.580
I've read the Alexander book as well

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.900
and I've even read,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.260
have you read the Gang of Four patterns book?

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.520
I have the Gang of Four.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.400
I do not recommend reading it.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.760
No, I do.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.200
Like what if you can't sleep at night

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.520
and you wanna.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.360
It works for that.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.180
Yeah, it does.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.020
Exactly.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.600
It's great for insomnia.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.600
For design patterns,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.920
like the way I've,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.120
Al Shalloway and the,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.630
okay, he's a buddy of mine.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.350
And yeah, he and I go to lunch quite often.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.710
How come you never invite me to lunch with Al?

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.710
I'll do it next time.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.550
You better.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.240
The way I tell.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.760
Purely so I can name drop Al Shalloway too.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.800
The way I tell people

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.440
if they wanna dive deep into design patterns

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.520
and you don't need to,

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.760
if you're one of the three

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.880
and you spend most of your time as a black box tester,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.760
just read the head first one.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.480
But if you wanna go deeper,

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:34.730
then pick up Al Shalloway's book,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.680
Explaining Design Patterns.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.000
Head first design patterns

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.350
will teach you why design patterns are freaking cool.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.190
Okay, and.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.010
In great ways.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:45.850
In great ways.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.870
With examples using pizza and other things.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.070
Yeah, and what was it?

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.190
Star buzz.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:54.510
And the duck thing.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.550
Yeah, it is just.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.550
It's a great.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.750
It's really well done.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.150
It's really, it really is.

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.750
And just to interrupt there,

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.910
I've read,

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.270
that was the first head first book I read

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.630
and I've read a few others.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.510
They're good, but not as good as the design patterns one.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.110
It is the best head first book.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.570
But the head first,

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.670
the head first style,

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.710
if you have a choice between getting a

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.270
blah, blah, blah for dummies

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.150
or the head first blah, blah, blah.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.270
Or even the textbook.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.630
Get the head first blah, blah, blah.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.070
Yeah.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.310
Then go look at

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.030
the explaining design patterns.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.670
Because what Al does really well in that book,

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:38.430
is it shows you how to design with design patterns.

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:42.990
How there's this fantastic process called CVA,

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.990
which I'm no longer remembering

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.990
what the acronym stands for.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.510
Where it allows you to pick and choose.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.150
So let's say you got to connect two components.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.470
Do I choose the adapter pattern?

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.630
Do I choose the bridge pattern?

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:56.510
There is a,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:01.550
there is a great process that he goes through and describes

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.910
around how to pick which design patterns to use.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.630
And then the head or the gang of four book,

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.630
Dear God, never start with that book.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.870
That book is a reference.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.310
This book is,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:21.310
it's like going to the index card section of a library.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.470
It tells you what other things exist.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.670
So if you going through and you're designing,

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.150
you're going, you know,

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.670
I don't think this pattern fits.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.630
That's a good book to use as a reference.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.990
And I have,

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.190
I probably have 10 different books on design patterns

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.030
in my library in my office.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.080
Those three are the ones I use the most often.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.920
Very cool.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.720
Hey, we have just a few minutes left,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.750
but I want to make sure that we get to the

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:50.590
mailbag.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.410
I love mailbag.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.050
Who doesn't love mailbag?

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.130
And we've done this before with other people

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.690
where we've highlighted one person

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:03.770
for pretty much the whole show.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.100
And today is apparently Danny Fot day.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.580
Because Danny Fot had a question.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.580
He asked in our one of the three.slack.com channel team.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.560
He asked,

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.160
what do you think of property based testing tools?

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.640
And there's an example,

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.000
I haven't tried one in anger,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.920
but from what I've read,

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.520
these appear to be useful tools for exploratory testing,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.440
but are not a substitute for unit tests

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.880
given their non determinism, et cetera, et cetera.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.200
What do you think of these?

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.160
So the question is really,

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:42.510
there's some discussion afterwards in the slack messages,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.070
but really it's,

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.510
Brent's looking at me very confused.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.110
So go back to that lesson,

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.670
they're not suitable for unit tests

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.250
because of their non determinism.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:55.330
Why are they non deterministic?

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:56.530
Not the point.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:01.130
There's a link in which Dave Thomas

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.490
makes somewhat trolly assertion

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.970
that unit tests are a waste of time.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.690
Everyone should be using quick check.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.890
I said trolly because other comments make it clear

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.170
he's actually railing against bad unit testing.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.450
So his position is probably a bit more nuanced

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.490
in the statement implies,

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.050
which is absolutely true.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:20.000
I also am against bad unit testing.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.840
I'm also-

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.200
I will take a strong stance.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.270
So-

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.670
Wait, I'm gonna lay down some controversy.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:33.800
I am 100% against bad testing in all forms.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.320
For once I'm going to agree with you, Brent.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.520
So since the dawn of time

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.960
or the dawn of software engineering,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.420
there have been companies who strive to

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.380
not only make our lives easier,

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.980
but to advertise the crap

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.140
out of how much easier they've made our lives.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.100
Whether it's in most testers have seen

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.020
the dozens, if not hundreds of tools

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.260
that will allow you to automate all your testing

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.150
without writing any code.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.430
Here we have an example, not quite as bad as that.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.110
We have an example of tools

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.110
and Microsoft has had some similar tools.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.510
They're part of Visual Studio now,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:15.070
which do some automatic unit testing

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.190
by looking at the parameters and the contracts

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.910
and generating a whole bunch of unit tests,

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.390
different parameters and finding the bugs for you.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.510
Great tools.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:23.510
Great tools.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.470
They help you find some bugs.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.230
Some of which may be very obscure

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:29.910
and wouldn't be hit, we'll call them edge cases.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.630
But as testers, we know the value

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.830
in fixing the edge cases

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:34.910
because when you have a million users,

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.790
you have a significant portion hitting those edge cases.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.190
So all good.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.830
But are they a substitute for unit testing?

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.350
And my answer is absolutely no.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.510
They are a supplement for unit testing

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.230
because the value in unit testing,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.830
even if you're not doing test driven development,

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.570
is it makes you write better, cleaner code

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.450
in the first place

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.890
because you have to write code that is testable.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:58.890
I have trained.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.930
You said even if you're not doing TDD

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.730
and that's not true,

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.090
if you're not doing TDD,

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.530
then you're writing your code

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.610
and then using the stupid tool to generate stupid tests.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.930
So, no backup.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.010
So now I wanna say,

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:15.450
if you're writing unit tests without doing TDD,

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.970
I have trained dozens, hundreds of developers

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.570
in both writing tests with using TDD

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.050
and writing unit tests without using TDD.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.050
Now TDD, we can talk about it.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.930
Okay, I will talk about it.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.010
Because you have to write your tests first,

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.170
you consciously think about how that code has to function.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.250
Using TDD makes you write

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.490
more testable, better designed code.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.190
But what I found in experience,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.670
even if people don't jump onto TDD

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.610
and write the unit tests afterwards,

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.210
once they, in my experience,

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.110
not everyone, but the majority for sure,

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.810
even if they know they're going to be writing unit tests,

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.530
just the fact that they know

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.090
they're going to be writing unit tests,

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.770
they write clearer, more concise code

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:00.930
than they would have if they knew

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.250
they weren't going to test it.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.130
Or when they go to write that unit test,

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.250
the first thing they do is go,

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.530
oh crap, I can't test this.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.830
Let me refactor my code and make it more testable.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.370
Those things do happen.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.730
TDD, in my experience,

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.930
is the most efficient and best way

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.610
to get that code that way in the first place.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.330
Yep, but for those that won't jump in,

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.350
I do think that just writing the unit tests

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.450
and having some discipline around that

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:28.230
has not equal, but in some cases, similar benefit.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.590
One of the questions,

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.530
I don't know if he had it in this particular response,

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.550
but one of the questions that popped out,

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:42.660
Alan alluded to it, or Luke, Alan eluded to it.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.860
Hey, is unit, is, I'll call it PBT,

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.200
a replacement for unit testing.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.420
And I'm going to say, absolutely not.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.380
Well duh.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.020
And the biggest reason, because,

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.680
so I love tools.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.380
Tools simplify our lives, they make everything better.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.660
But there's one thing that they do that's really bad.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.420
And that is they encourage intellectual laziness.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.340
So any developer who picks up these tools that go,

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.020
hey look, I just generated 3,000 test cases,

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.330
my unit test suite is done.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:26.130
Get none of the design benefits

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.690
that you just referred to.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.330
Yeah, I think for a lot of things in testing,

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:34.480
if there's some sort of dichotomy, it's probably wrong.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.080
So does automation replace testers?

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.200
No, does it enhance them?

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.040
Yes.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.740
Replace testers?

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.840
Testers or testing?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.680
Testing.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.520
Testers, yeah.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.560
If you have a bunch of automation.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.800
It's not the point you're making.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.440
So the point is, we look for things,

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.880
and we don't look, we're told that a tool

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.520
or something will replace something else.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.900
But in most cases in testing or software engineering,

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.080
the tool merely enhances or supplements.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.320
In fact, not merely, that's the main benefit.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.960
And I think if I could jump into marketing

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.880
of testing tools for a while,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.920
I wanna talk about how they supplement, not replace.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.000
These tools we're talking about

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.280
as far as test generation based on inputs,

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.480
totally supplements unit tests.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.560
If you wanna run those, I think it's great.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.560
I think you'll find a lot more bugs.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.400
You still have to write good unit tests.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.120
If someone pick random Juju Fruit,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
it's probably too close to something,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.200
there's so many names of automation tools,

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.600
but Juju Fruit automation framework.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.720
Great test automation, don't have to write any code.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.000
Is that gonna replace my unit test?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.600
No, my integration test?

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.620
No.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.320
Is there no use for it all at all?

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.240
No, because I may decide like,

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.200
oh yeah, this is automation tool,

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.820
works at a very high level.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.320
May have some false positives.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.440
May have some flakiness, cause you're automation,

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.710
but there may be some,

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.550
I would guarantee there's some places I could find

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.140
to use that, that would give me some coverage

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.140
I couldn't do by myself.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.260
But it doesn't replace anything I do.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.840
But the point is I can use any of these tools

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.500
to enhance what I'm doing.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.300
Not to replace things I'm doing.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:19.100
You can, the thing I still wanna sort of rail against

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:24.400
is it is not, none of these tools.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.680
So let's talk about it a different way.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.440
The benefits of these tools.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.840
Okay, so if the goal that you're trying to achieve

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.980
is a checkbox claiming I have a unit test suite.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.820
You know what?

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.500
Test generation tools kick ass at that.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.260
If that's the goal you're trying to do,

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.740
knock yourself out, you're going to have

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.820
a bunch of tests really rapidly.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.900
That's worth a tangent because, very quick,

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.660
I'll just make a point that,

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.180
I love that you bring up the checkbox,

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.540
cause so much of what I hear and experience

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.460
in engineering is about,

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.140
there's a lot of checkbox engineering.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.260
We don't need to get the benefit of this,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.500
we just need to say we've done it.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.420
Right.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.260
Go on.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.460
And I do know, particularly in the last five years,

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.760
as Microsoft has gone through this transition,

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.600
sort of a bookend of the podcast today,

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.180
there are several devs that just like,

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.880
God damn it, I don't wanna think about testing.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.840
I just want a tool that just gives me that checkbox.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.880
Right.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.440
Now, if you wanna move up the stack

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:34.590
and have your code be better maintenance,

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.110
easier to maintain,

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:43.110
then, even then, these test generation tools will help you

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.390
and you'll still have to provide

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.320
a modest amount of thoughtfulness

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.520
in order to maximize that benefit

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.080
around the maintenance cost.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.880
If you just go, I'm gonna generate a bunch of test cases,

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.160
yay, checkbox, well, when that test suite runs,

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:07.000
you're going to be stuck into a bunch of maintenance,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.600
understanding why this test case is suddenly failing,

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.320
blah, blah, blah.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.240
So even then, so winding up,

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.340
this can help reduce test maintenance.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.380
Now, if you wanna go even further and say,

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:26.700
hey, I want the code I write, have the maximum ROI,

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.900
which means reusability,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.080
the ability to integrate new features on demand,

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.660
reacting to the marketplace,

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.600
then you're going to need 70% thoughtfulness

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.630
and 30% this type of tooling.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.810
This is where, again, where TDD comes into play.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.810
TDD forces you into that thoughtful design process

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:58.100
so that you can construct your code in a way that yields

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.700
that top tier of benefits that I just mentioned.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.740
Yeah, I think there's a whole podcast on sort of,

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.340
I've been thinking about it while you're talking,

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.370
checkbox engineering versus craftsmanship.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.530
I love these tools.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:14.170
The biggest problem, there's a new catchphrase.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:15.490
Automation is great.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:20.210
Automation allows you to take a lot of these painful things

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.210
and do them really easy.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:25.530
But the problem with automation is it also allows you

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:29.690
to really reduce the friction on delivering

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.690
on really crappy outcomes.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:37.690
Like, now I have a test suite of a million test cases

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.610
all auto-generated where on any given day,

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.310
25% are failing.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:44.870
Oh God.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.230
Yeah. Do the math, that's awful.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.680
Yep.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.540
All right, we are done,

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.380
and it looks like my microphone's still recording,

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.400
so I'm pretty happy.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:58.160
I'll get this edited and out to the people soon.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.000
Thanks everybody.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.840
I'm Alan.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.660
I'm Brent.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.500
We'll see you next time.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.340
Yep.
