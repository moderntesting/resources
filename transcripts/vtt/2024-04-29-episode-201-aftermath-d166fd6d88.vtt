Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.730
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show welcome back to the AB

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.210
testing podcast I'm still Alan I'm Brent and it's it's episode 201 the aftermath

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.230
edition yes and my actual 200 skipped one not done a lot more than 200 if you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.150
count the 343 but anyway which I do if you have caught up in our podcast you

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.110
know that our last episode like a year ago three weeks ago was our 200th

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.970
episode we I don't think we planned on taking this long of a time off that

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.490
stuff life happens you know we're we have life and stuff happens and then we

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.450
don't record for a while but we're recording again and I have some ideas

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.810
about recording that I wanted to share with you but first of all how's it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.690
going what's new in your world that you're allowed to share under a non-nda

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:22.820
agreement springtime we call it fifth winter in Seattle yeah I know I can now

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:31.020
tell you what what exactly 12 yards of dirt looks like big pallet earth it is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.200
like a big pallet earth it does 12 12 yards of it like I don't know if you so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.480
I'm yeah I see like the cat who is now a regular on the Brent side of the podcast

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.120
is batting Brent in the arm for refusing to pet him enough it's her this is her

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.000
sorry this is scruffy and yeah she's like you've left me alone at home all day long

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.170
I apologize for getting your pronouns wrong all right yeah yeah she can't hear

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.770
you but I'm sure she accepts it cool cool I think that if I ignore she'll

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.970
ignore me all right were you in the middle of answering a question or just

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:29.430
kind of hanging out yeah I'm busily nuking my yard I am I am now tired of

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.710
getting a free vibration massage just by mowing the lawn so I've got a bunch of

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:45.310
dirt leveling it out and we'll go from there cool we have a lawn about half the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.210
size of my office here so I'm all with a push mower in about five minutes nice

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.820
no vibration needed hey so I'm I had an idea and I hadn't told you about it and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.580
it's already kind of wrecked but I think I can salvage it okay and this is

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.260
behind the scenes of a B testing it's not an idea for you those of you that pay

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.020
close attention to the a B testing podcast know that Brent shows up and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.580
then we record and then I do all the editing and get you the wonderful

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:29.130
podcast that you hear now now it usually takes me about 150 to 200% of the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.480
podcast length to edit and because I go through and I do a couple things I get

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.960
rid of Brent coughing in the background just happened a minute ago if I don't get

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.560
that out of there when Brent decides to type in the middle of when I'm talking I

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.160
get that out of there and then also I do both of us get rid of some of the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.550
filler words that we use I could actually it was funny here is I could

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.450
probably replicate all of Brent's filler words if I want I may do that for fun

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.230
sometime because they're pretty consistent they're pretty consistent but

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.670
anyway but and sometimes when we talk over each other it's good in the moment

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.430
but I'll shift things around I'll actually do I'll actually shift things

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.150
around so we're not sounds like a conversation and not the cacophony that

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.310
we usually generate and try to make it sound pretty good and of course I'll

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.600
always do all the the tweaking on audio levels and settings etc but I've

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.820
been doing that for 200 episodes which is fine it's actually I'll drink wine

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.170
will I do it I'll be all I can't like watch a TV show cuz I can't after the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.250
one set of audio at a time but it's fine not complaining but after 200 I wanted

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.340
to get 200 recorded and get it out so I spent a grand total of about 10 minutes

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.700
at most and I just yanked out all of the places where Brent was typing or

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.120
coughing or breathing heavily into the microphone I usually spot those things

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.660
visually and go silence those in a second you should so you shouldn't have

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.960
been dealing with the breathing thing for a while because I've no longer use

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.340
this Mike no no it still shows up sometimes it's still it depends it

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.440
depends so anyway I I'm gonna do an experiment so here's what I need Brent

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.400
you won't notice but for the listeners I am going to spend remarkably

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.320
less time editing this podcast and maybe the next one till we get some feedback

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.680
I'm still gonna get the levels and the audio as good as I can and get

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.240
everything in there oh you know what I was dumb I should have played usually

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.520
when I edit then I go in and add the intro I should just start doing that

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.630
live from now on and give me one damn less thing to do I blew it I blew it

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.710
next time I'll get that but I'm gonna make an experiment see if a few more

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:04.890
words don't take too much away from the podcast I'll see if I can time back

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.090
set it to 15 or less and see what happens anyway that was my revelation after doing

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:18.140
200 and let me know I'm happy again if people come and say you know what Alan

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.530
when you don't edit you two sound like a couple of dumb shits then I'll go

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.010
back and make us sound less dumb shitty that's the time I just want to

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.670
make sure if anytime to make sure we sound a little bit smarter than we

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.820
actually are both of us all right brand has given me for the first time ever he

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.620
has given me two fingers up and the fingers are thumbs this time which is

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.400
pretty amazing yeah I'm finding that if I for the most part just stay on mute

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:58.280
then I'm not gonna get in trouble give it give it this new rules so before

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.060
you were like well fuck it I'll just get into I mean well now I have to go edit

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.060
that damn it I'm just I don't know what to do nobody will notice who's gonna

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:15.580
report me right what happens if I don't put the explicit tag on and I say that

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.180
again I'll leave it in there once maybe it's like PG where I can get away with it

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.580
once as long as I don't repeat I don't know I don't know anyway do you want to

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.320
oh go ahead oh I've been thinking about this all week so I'll wait for you I'm

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.530
done tell me what you're thinking about I will tell you something that we haven't

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:44.140
talked about I am hoping you already know about this but I'm kind of hoping you

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:52.940
don't okay that hash a core was bought by IBM no okay cuz that sucks anyway go on

00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:00.240
Amazon Prime yes fallout already watched the whole series in one day did you I

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:09.180
wasn't able to but all weekend oh my god was that good dude I even talked about

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.320
it last week not yet not today but a week ago on my five for Friday okay because

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:22.090
it's uh so my wife started watching it and she says hey I've been watching

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:29.270
Fallout it's really good I said hold the f on your been watching for favorite

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:36.010
video game always oh is it based on a video game back from the mic for a little

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:49.710
bit so I said would you would you like to stop like hatch up or shall we start

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.230
over and we started over okay watch from the beginning and it's like it is of

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.370
course in the fallout world but not the storyline so I get a lot of questions of

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.050
is that in the game is that in the game or me saying that's in the game like when

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.530
they go to Red Rock I'm not giving spoilers away because the series is

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:15.290
great it's a story in the fallout world with just enough total scene steals from

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.730
the game from Fallout 4 probably for some other fallouts to the fallout 4

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.530
really pops up there a lot that it's like oh my god that's so cool like the

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:31.260
Red Rocket diner which is gonna bring up a minute ago the the armor and and the

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.660
armor and like the armor stations where you work on the armor it's like they're

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:43.880
they are perfect yeah perfect and and I was reading an article but that's the

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.400
gave them no requirements on the power armor they could have done whatever they

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:55.320
wanted to and they decided to keep it like legit and I'm like awesome that's

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.680
what you should have done that's what you did do that's fantastic couple of

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.320
things that I learned after all right it's like don't know still really no

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:14.330
spoilers so apparently the series that is I didn't realize this but it's a

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:23.090
hundred years after fallout new vegas okay I didn't I'm like because I

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.400
throughout the entire show I'm like the hell what are they talking about right

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:36.570
um and it's it's a hundred years after if there's only one thing that I caught

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:43.250
that I'm like yeah that's not how it happens in the game I won't necessarily

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:57.280
bring it up here but it is really good oh we get dog meat backstory that might

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.680
have been us that might have been a spoiler there but dog meat is one of my

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.360
favorite characters in the entire series it was great to see him I'm like

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:12.280
Doug it her damn you and your pronouns today with the animals I didn't I didn't

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:20.440
check the gender in the game they they mentioned she's a she in the in the show

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:26.400
I've forgotten but I'm like that's fine saying pronouns mean nothing to me I guess

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:33.030
maybe that's bad nevermind gotta me and the and the thing that got me like just

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:42.500
just stupid 12 year old giggly was with the very first episode and a guy died

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:51.480
be by being well that might be a spoiler but the junk jet I'm like that's a joke

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:58.240
kid oh my god you know what else is cool is and again no spoilers but the Pip

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.480
boys but the Pip boy when you go near radiation the exact same sound as the

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.680
game yeah I noticed that too I'm like well I don't have in the game I don't

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:17.760
I just get the cooking noise I don't yeah yeah anyway you know it really well

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.000
done like I said it's a whole new story so it's totally accessible for somebody

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.320
who's never played the game but also a lot of fun for those of us that has and

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.960
I don't know if you know this Amazon made the streaming versions of a lot of

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.320
the fallout games free going along with the series so they could a lot of

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.780
people than playing those I don't know the head yeah streaming we get ma'am wake

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:48.300
up we got a podcast to do yes the year so it so but you mentioned that the

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.900
fallout the series is like a hundred years after fallout new Vegas isn't

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.700
fallout 4 just like basically right after new Vegas so isn't it really like a

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.770
hundred years after fallout 4 as well or it or is fallout 4 later I don't know

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:14.540
the timeline and then fallout 76 was based way earlier in the thing like in

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:23.520
but probably not on any 76 2076 I don't know how it works out 21 70 was 200 years

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:37.280
after everybody's podcast hey everybody shall we shall we actually talk about

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:44.040
like well a be testing no none of that stuff do you want to do anything else

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:52.590
before we do the the thing hold up maybe all right all fallout games in

00:13:52.590 --> 00:14:03.080
chronological order so 76 is first right and that was in the 2100s early 2100s

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:17.080
okay then fallout 1 which I played not play 2161 fallout tactics which I did not

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:25.200
play me neither fallout brotherhood is that that was 2197 fallout brotherhood is

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:32.600
steel I did play 2208 I didn't do that one either follow up to 2241 I played

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:44.040
did not follow up 320 played that 2277 then new Vegas is new Vegas is 2281

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:53.200
played that 2281 and 4 is 2287 okay so I'll basically right after yeah those

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.000
two were close enough so so even this series is like a hundred after right and

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.230
fallout new Vegas like the NRC is a big deal there and it's also a big deal in

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:14.200
the series wait what year is fallout for 2287 and when is the series 23 87

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:22.630
23 80 the site I'm looking at doesn't state okay but there again there was

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:28.840
another article I read that said the series is around a hundred years after

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.280
new Vegas all right we'll figure it out and okay then yeah okay then now that

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:42.160
everyone is bored and I did get to write a new song so that's good why don't we

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.760
just bring it back to something we haven't done in a long time let's go

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:58.710
old-school you're ready to go old-school Brent I am let's kick it off with oh that

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:05.710
was way better that's not old-old-school that's just old days old days

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:11.430
go like this I say and then I go in post I would go edit and add the audio

questions all right God what what do you think I am just teasing this came

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.650
from Sean Curtis thank you very much for the question I just moved from a

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:48.450
software agency housing 25 employees and 14 natural projects so small company over

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.810
to a large organization of hundreds of people and a few dozen services which all

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:56.500
tie in together okay stuff's getting bigger in my first week I've heard a lot

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.700
of developers who are stuck in not my problem mentality which is very damaging

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.700
to the products in the organization itself true as part of my onboarding I

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.740
kind of expected some level of documentation on the services I will be

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:16.200
testing but that's not even remotely a thing here been there with the rise of AI

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.960
I'm wondering if there could be an Azure solution because they use Azure tools to

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.440
analyze all of the repos and produce a context diagram based on the current

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.700
state of committed works or is that too ambitious I guess the underlying

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:36.500
question here is would there be added risks with a QA engineer writing the

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.780
documentation based on the develop solution outside of capturing developer

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:45.120
influence so I want to answer all this I'm only gonna and I'm gonna let you

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:51.720
answer first like the easy question which is can we analyze have AI analyze the

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.520
repos and produce a context diagram based on the current state of committed works

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.640
and I'll elaborate on some answers for the second one

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:05.100
Brent you're up can we do that could AI do that I'm trying to recall is context

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.580
diagram an actual formal thing well I don't know but okay but I don't know

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.020
and I'm gonna answer for you if you don't get to it yeah it can generate it for

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:20.820
sure whether it's useful or does anything good is a separate question well it's

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.180
talking about documentation and maybe I'll do the second one first I think

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.700
this is actually a really good question and something maybe more company should

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.180
do because I remember it I'm sure you did this back in the day when we were

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:39.550
in test I remember having no documentation for something I was testing

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:45.820
no spec for it and that and as a result of testing it I would write up a diagram

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:51.220
not diagram I would write up a document saying this is how this thing works and

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.180
what it does and maybe not totally in-depth but a pretty good deep

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.340
document describing what the thing was I was testing did and how it works and

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:05.780
all that and I would give it to our program managers and say here here's a

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:11.780
document describing what what we're building is it right and they go works

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:17.300
for me so we're just asking AI to do that for us which I think it actually

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:26.030
do a better job at right that that is absolutely possible today it's probably

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:35.740
going to take more time to get the AI to do something useful with the nut right

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:46.020
he talks about repos there like GPT has a token limit you can't just like point

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:52.540
it at a repo and say document this right you you have to write code on top of

00:20:52.540 --> 00:21:00.600
that but yeah it could it certainly could do something there with some

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.530
creativity with some thought you could have it do something smart there you

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:13.050
could have it I guess my bigger question though before letting you finish your

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:20.460
question is okay but what's the point right if you if you're gonna have it

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.450
sit there writing the documentation to me it feels like the time would be better

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:34.550
spent having it right documented test cases and here I don't mean like

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:41.940
documented in a you know in like a test case manager I mean like automated test

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:50.540
cases with useful comments as to why those are there okay so I'm doing the

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.500
Brent I'm actually our roles are reversed Brent's being sensible and I'm trying

00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:04.680
something out so my hypothesis is that and I know it can do this because I've

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:13.100
done it before is to ask chat GPT or co-pilot what this code does and or even

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:18.500
you make an API documentation for this code or whatever and it would do pretty

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.730
well yeah it will and I imagine you could do it on large sets it actually be

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:30.970
pretty pretty doable what I have just done and and I have chat GPT for thinking

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:37.130
hard because it's typing very slowly it's answer but what I did and you can do

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:43.610
this on your own so much sharing my screen is I took last year's winter

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:51.330
winter this is why I edit this is cold cold hard uncut just like your roast ham

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:59.980
I pasted copied and pasted last year's winner of the obfuscated see contest

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:05.360
familiar with this for those you are not this is right perfectly functional yet

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.880
impossible to read code and see and I paste it in the chat GPT and said what

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:20.180
does this code do and it is slowly telling me I it's really have no hard

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:25.620
time but it's getting there we don't have time to wait for it but it actually

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:33.040
tells me enough and what's here it actually did pretty well not great all

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.560
right that's a bad one this is a bad example but what they've done in this

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.880
case is rather than put it in one file they have made the worst make file in

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.880
all history to actually identify some of the macros in there which makes this

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.760
absolutely impossible to figure out it would take some time to train chat GPT

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:59.160
anyway the point those who haven't turned off the podcast yet the point is that I

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.440
think yes the answer is yes we took a very long time to say yes you can use AI

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:11.100
to help in this scenario I may have I did something myself sharing screen

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:18.870
because I think it's funny great this is great for podcast yeah absolutely so I

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:29.380
took I asked what did this do by the way I found a code example for doing a Morse

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:39.060
code converter right very very little code I pasted it into the Bing bot and as

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:50.390
Alan will validate that broke it it is it is typing the 2016 Olympic Games are not

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:57.110
yet in the public domain over and over and over you completely broke it right

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:03.270
and it started off with a bunch of dots than random numbers and I'm like that is

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:11.670
excellent well you really yeah and now because I spent a lot of my time with LLM

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:21.860
I'm like how did I get there from here yes like anyway yeah I'll let you know you

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.700
had to have shot I don't know what you did but that is cooler than crap no you

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.940
see my prompt I just say what does this do when I gave it code I do yeah I do I

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:39.220
see it I see it it's uh and normally it works I have like I've given it SQL code

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:45.940
I've given it and so let me get back on topic for this question and I want to

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.620
again I hypothesize on stuff because you know more way more about the stuff than I

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:58.940
do but I think asking code what it giving a tragedy PTC code in general and

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:07.980
asking it what it does is probably going to give you more useful information and

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:14.060
having it right tests you more useful information than having it write code for

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:22.610
you co-pilot of course is very good at writing code but you have to did you lose

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:27.340
me okay I got a little real thing here all right

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.720
co-pilot is very good at writing code but I don't think we're at a point where we

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:43.480
can all trust it as much as we want to yet no and while it's an AI um yeah you

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:49.800
should continue to not trust it like I will tell you I spend the majority of my

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:55.720
time anytime I do an LLM exercise I spend the majority of my time going

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:10.620
okay now how will I at scale determine if it's hallucinating I have actually come

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:17.460
up with a neat trick but I got to do a little bit more polish on it and and

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:23.580
then I'll come back and share it it's fun I'll tell you what I am doing as a

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:29.580
nutshell because maybe this one's fire folks everyone is using the LLM right now

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:36.100
to give us answers to things tell us stuff right you know the old phrase give

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:41.770
a man a fish the eat for a day teach them the fish be for a lifetime I was

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:51.260
like oh what if I get the LLM to teach me to fish so instead of telling me the

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:57.420
the answer I'm looking for tell me instead how to work out the answer

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:06.170
myself that's number one number two do so in a way that ends up being machine

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:14.380
reusable like that I started off doing this like I always have a prompt now of

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.780
outputting this in a JSON payload which it will do really well if you tell it

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:26.010
upfront like what your keys should be it'll output it in a JSON payload but

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:32.740
what I'm now working through is yeah give me don't give me the answer give me how

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:38.980
to figure it out myself and I have some more specific thoughts around this one

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:46.220
I got to talk try it out because if I can connect it to another system known as

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:57.390
an expert system then I'll say this quite broadly I will have have solved the

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:04.200
hallucination problem very interesting I think we talked about this before but

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:12.280
two or three five four Fridays ago I not three maybe three or four I posted a

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:17.960
quiz somebody made sort of an interactive LLM quiz but the idea was had

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.640
ten questions varying difficulty of the goal was to get the LLM to give the

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.630
right answer and in some cases it couldn't because LLMs are stupid parrots

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:34.430
but you could prompt it better to give the proper answer by it was a good

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.500
little training on how to give better prompts we kind of need to do like

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.940
you're on to something there with coding I think too many people are saying write

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:52.630
this code for me or tell me how to do this or do this algorithm and I think

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:59.820
there's something we could do around and I hate I will not and I refuse to use

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.830
the word prompt engineering phrase prompt engineering did you have a book

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:10.110
and Brent seriously seriously was looking at a book I didn't even see

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.590
the title of it called prompt engineering for everyone and now I'm

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.950
gonna be a little sick no a lot sick I'll try and hold it in if it gives

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:25.110
inspiration maybe but and I get the I get the gist of it and that's the title

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:34.890
that sells yeah every single person I see crapping on any aspect of Gen AI and

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:39.330
LLMs and again it's not a perfect science but all the people who are air

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:45.230
quotes skeptical about it don't have a clue how they work hence can't give it a

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:51.310
prompt that will help them understand if they're useful or not and anyway I think

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.790
it applies to coding as well even though it's an area where it actually does

00:30:54.790 --> 00:31:00.950
better than a lot of other areas but it needs a little help sometimes and if

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:06.030
you have if you're coming up with some clues around how to kind of outsmart it

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:12.390
make sure it gives you good answers I dig it it's I mean you can use it for

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:20.870
what it is right but I can't like my team and data science team we can't because

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:26.150
it's it's just massive onion peeling if we it is why don't we do this why don't

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:31.470
we have ask again this is a little farther down the road we can ask some

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:37.910
AI to go not fix but go open issues against all the bugs it finds in all of

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:50.950
github see again that's gonna be that is that is code plus hello because of the

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:57.000
token limit true true I'm just thinking of what I'm thinking of as you know I've

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
always been deeply involved in static analysis tools I thought well this is

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.600
not wouldn't that be a flavor of static analysis not we're not asking you to

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.400
find like esoteric things but a lot of a lot of things that I guess technically I

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.590
guess maybe we just run a static analysis tool against all it get had to be better

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:18.990
be a be an easier use of time so anyway just going come up ideas you know how you

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:25.120
get good ideas Brent they can by connecting it to you get a lot of ideas

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.080
and you throw the bad ones away okay I'm just gonna check that one over my

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.840
shoulder it'll land on my dog's head yeah but I'm gonna tell you it's not a

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:39.240
bad idea actually no no because static analysis tools will give you one set of

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:48.500
problems LLM can actually point out runtime bugs right if you do it right so

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:55.180
if you were to go let's say you you segmented function by function right you

00:32:55.180 --> 00:33:00.260
you can go to a depot and you can create a regex that two parts out doesn't

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.940
matter what language you could parse it out let's go by class and break it down

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:11.060
by method and let's go method by method okay and you'll get one set of bugs and

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.660
it'll say I don't know what these parameters should be right but it often

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:25.300
tell you you should worry about you know by die languages here or even things of

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.360
that nature now the trick though is it's gonna generate all of this crap

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:37.150
that that might even be more words to read than the code itself true so how do

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:41.270
you process that at scale and that's kind of where I'm talking about the

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:47.370
machine reusable bit yeah let me I want to run something by we haven't talked about

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:53.660
this before yeah this is I did this like a year ago my son was in a comp sci

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.900
class and just so I could help him I did a couple of his assignments in

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.380
parallel so if he had questions I could say oh did you try this and give him a

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:08.980
little hints and one of the assignments was so hard that I asked chat GPT to

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:14.860
give me some help and it actually could not solve it at one point it told me you

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.640
can't do it this way please try another method and what I was trying to do but I

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.220
actually ended up wrote night I don't have the code of my machine no more I

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.820
have I saved it somewhere because I was so actually proud of this assignment I

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:33.730
did for myself only it was a small calculator app had to be entirely

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:40.470
object-oriented absolutely no conditionals in the whole program no

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:49.170
conditionals okay and by the time I got to a solution like I was and I was damn

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:53.730
proud of it like I couldn't believe like I couldn't believe it was possible either

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.380
and my son did pretty well on it I think I just had to help him some of the

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.420
tests on it I think but of course he was going to class every day where maybe

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:08.340
he's getting some more tips but like no conditionals and I got stuck in a few

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:14.380
different places and I gave Chad GPT the code I written already and judge the

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:19.140
chat GPT for and I said I need I need to do this I can't use a conditional here

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:25.540
how else can I do it I said you can't do that did you should consider writing

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:31.580
this with conditionals it'd be a lot easier I said but no you didn't

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:40.180
understand the assignment so it yeah I ended up even with my best prompting and

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.300
maybe that maybe it's smarter now and I could do better prompting but I could not

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.340
get it to help me with the parts I was stuck on it was too hard of a problem

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:54.560
for it or maybe a problem that I can't say it hadn't been solved before

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.400
because there's lots of object-oriented code around there but probably not much

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:05.900
that tries to do everything with no conditionals anyway it's very interesting

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.420
I forgot about the experience I don't know why I never brought it up before

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:15.580
but I I think I was still fairly knew that was six months into the GPT world

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:20.460
GPT for was was pretty much brand new at the time and I was still in the

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.380
really kicking the tire stage which I guess I'm still in but earlier in the

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:30.920
entire kicking so immediately when you said that I immediately thought about the

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:38.960
commands pattern which is which is which will get you 95% there but I guess my

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:46.360
question is is try catch considered a conditional try catch is a conditional oh

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:54.040
that nice shot nice shot at a cheat right right I'm like okay what if I do

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:59.680
underscore underscore as and jump but no I get that was it was it's Java Java

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:03.960
virtual machine and let me do something good I assume a switch is a conditional

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:11.480
absolutely so I'm like okay like div by zero like how would you if someone does

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:17.640
a division by zero I actually handled that and I can't remember how there was

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:24.470
away I'm like okay I can do it if I can do a try I will I will dig up the code

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:28.950
and share it with you but like I said it in the end it was super simple and I was

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:33.110
fairly proud of it but I get and then my son only needed help with some of the

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:41.150
tests that we wrote for it so that's uh was that high school college okay it's

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:46.910
still hard I mean it's harder than than any college like I went through but

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:56.000
actually now I think about it I didn't I didn't learn well my object-oriented

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.340
class in college was was just was just three weeks long and it was a study of

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:10.100
the types of software coding languages you know what I did I read thinking in

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:20.220
c++ I actually and head first design patterns and the gang of four book and

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:27.260
probably something else along the road I did the the thinking in c++ I did that

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:35.440
Bruce Echol great book after I came back to started at Microsoft and I actually

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.920
took a course at Bellevue Community College that used that as its text ah

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:46.740
really cool really cool yeah I bet I fake my way through it but that's maybe

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.820
why I had so much fun with it because I never got a chance to do it in college

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:55.940
so it's fun for me to kind of not pretend I was in college but yeah but to

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.580
kind of fake me I would have some fun it was it was it was a fun it was a fun

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:06.210
couple of evenings open that out I was frustrated in college because they didn't

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:12.890
teach I wanted them to have a class for c++ they only had a class for C and I

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:20.600
found out pretty quickly that all the cool kids in in the CS degree they were

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:28.220
already self-trained not only on c++ but I forget what was the the name of the

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:33.910
Windows graphic system back then like with all the goddamn handles and all of

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:41.710
that crap just GDI user GDI maybe I don't know but all the cool kids already knew

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:53.500
how to do all that I'm like I don't but function pointers are cool the old time

00:39:53.500 --> 00:40:01.710
so yeah yeah like people are gonna regret asking us questions if we answer the

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:06.310
actual question this is what we do like this is the tangent podcast we answer the

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:11.750
actual question in like seconds and then find adjacent things to talk about for

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:20.700
the next 35 minutes I'm sorry did we are we no longer the A.B. testing podcast no

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:27.550
no we are who we are it is totally fine I was totally fine I was worried there

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:32.420
for a second I'm gonna well I don't know I don't think I want to do the other

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:38.340
mailbag I think it's probably pretty good for today yeah yeah I hope you guys

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:43.700
learned something it's good to be back it is I can't believe it's 201 on the

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:50.940
countdown 202 you know well what one podcast at a time what's your

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:57.450
prediction on when we will get to 202 I'm gonna say in a week or two I can't

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.170
remember what our schedule is are we up next week because we skipped a week are

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:05.810
we going back to every two weeks from today that's a good question for you and

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.610
I that no none of our listeners care about except for Jason said he gets mad

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:17.180
like Jason gets mad when he has to wait two weeks now he's pissed my boss says

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.500
he doesn't like when we have guests so we have to do no guests every week I

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:28.880
can't do it yeah no can't do it we should ask your boss on as a guest mmm

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.720
why did you say that I'm not

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:40.820
leadership people at a level they can absorb I'm wondering how far his no guest

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:47.860
rule goes oh that would be can I tell you one word one work story about this

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:53.790
because that would be a little bit of a is that a paradox let me tell you the

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.890
paradox or I have it work there is another person named Alan Page who works

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:03.680
where I work really yes we're a different department and I feel bad

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:11.120
because he's been there longer but but but he gets way more of my email than I

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:20.440
get of his I see and if it I think it's worse because well it got worse because

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.840
for the first time ever we both ended up in the same slack channel because it

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.600
turns out my team's helping his team build a thing he's way far removed from

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.960
my org and then so in that channel someone tagged me when they meant to tag

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:40.480
him so I jumped in to retag other Alan and then the paradox began and he the

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.840
other Alan pointed out that if we converse too much in slack we both ceased to

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.080
exist so we're very careful about it there is a paradox there the same with

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:56.920
yeah we yeah I don't know what to do we live in a world of paradox it seems

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:04.240
like he should probably go by his middle name from here on out well I could go I

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:12.980
could go by my middle oh I already do you're right okay all right well we can

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.820
do that we can call it a day I will I will not immediately but in the next

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.540
little while edit this in 15 minutes or less and see what ends up for the

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:26.730
public this has been fun coming back you know back to low-key there's no big

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:31.530
milestones coming up I don't think we have to do anything fun for 250 until 250

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:38.680
and that's like a long long time from now so back to low-key podcasts and we'll

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.440
figure out as we go did I answer by the way we are doing this next week oh the

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:50.720
okay yeah awesome I can do that man I'm in cool all right it's all I got man I'm

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.240
Alan I'm right we'll see you next time bye bye
