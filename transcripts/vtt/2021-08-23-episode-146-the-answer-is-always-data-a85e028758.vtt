00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:11.620
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.360
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey everyone

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.190
I'm Alan and Brent's not here. I decided as threatened

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.850
Previously on a podcast that if Brent wasn't here on time

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.530
I would just start without him and you could hear just how bad a solo podcast can be

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.690
Got a couple good topics lined up today. None of them have anything to do with sports nor politics nor the weather

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.290
I don't think all I want to say is Covid is not a political thing despite the fact that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.450
Far too many people see it as such, you know, my preference is that everyone gets vaccinated

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.710
I know there are some people that don't want to for various reasons

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.490
What I do ask is that for everyone look past the misinformation that's out there find out what's right for you

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.630
but please be careful and

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.110
realize that this is a real thing and

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.390
That it does get people sick and just do your best to be careful

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.650
Put some effort into being careful to make sure you're not being part of the spread of this and then maybe someday that light

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.510
At the end of the tunnel will begin to come back into view again

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.050
All right. Well, let's get on Brent's gonna get on here

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.570
He's gonna go blah blah blah and talk about stuff

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.210
I'm gonna make fun of him a little bit and then we get going with the podcast

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.250
But I do have somewhere an agenda for today

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.990
And I may as well start without him and we'll catch him up when he gets here

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.110
the first thing is I

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.950
Think it was the last podcast within the last few we talked about the wasn't the last one for sure. Oh, hey Brent's here

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.190
Brand I've already pressed record. I started the podcast without you. Welcome to the welcome to the A B testing podcast Brent

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.470
Thank you, Alan. I thought maybe we could do just one more without you. This is oh

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.350
Anyway, let's pause. I can go right back into where I was because Brent knows my agenda. How's it going? I will survive I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.910
will survive

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.110
Things are a foot

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.590
That will have a negative impact on my life

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.070
That I am not quite ready to share publicly on the podcast

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.570
Understood understood as much as we do leave a lot of things out there Brett and I both leave a few

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.230
Things to our private lives so I get that we can chat about that a little at the end if we have time

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.790
So yeah, that sucks. Um

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.830
Already talked about kovat. You missed that. Oh

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.030
Did you yeah any I'm not gonna add anything else. Do you have any short?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.830
Statements you want to make about the current surge in Delta variants, etc

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.310
No

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.870
The Delta the Delta variant surge concerns me far less than what's happening with Afghanistan. I

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.190
Think it wise for us to just skip over the political

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.670
I will just say this I'll just say I won't mention anything specifically and we'll move on between

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.290
everything going on

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.650
sometimes even

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.580
Optimistic Alan has to wonder if the end of the world is coming. That's all I have to say about that

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.900
Yeah, so, um, yeah, let's talk about stuff about the podcast. We have a podcast and

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.770
What's interesting about this podcast is called modern testing Brent and I are two old people

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.050
So we're not that modern and we don't really talk about testing very much, but we do and we will today

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.170
We talk about a lot about

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.810
Agile and agile flavors and we talk a lot about

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.910
How to improve quality? In fact, I would say I can safely say that Brent and I care

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.210
Deeply about quality but not so much about testing

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.660
No, no testing. I don't understand why we would talk so much about testing since it is clearly Dev's job

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.620
Alright, you got to stop chewing and bang on your desk just saying that but you're right

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.860
Oh, and I I want to read now I threw with Chatham House rules

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.620
I'm not this so this is so another slack I'm on says

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.910
And I'm gonna breaker. I'm gonna try not to break a rule by paraphrasing. See if I can find the channel here

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.590
someone was asking about

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.720
QA teams, I'm not gonna mention the slack or the people and I'm gonna paraphrase

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.680
I think I'm I think I'm gonna be okay here then cuz I'm not outing anybody

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.440
But someone was asking about how QA works at different orgs. This is a

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.440
Cross company industry slack. That's as far as I'll go and what's interesting is all of the replies in this thread

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.810
Saying we don't have QA, but we do lots of testing these people these and the thing is with modern testing

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.530
We're describing what's already happening in the world. These people haven't been

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.250
indoctrinated by modern testing

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
They're doing this because it's the right thing to do

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.410
Response to that is same here. No dedicated QA

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.650
Teams own entire services also on the testing of that service someone else says for what it's worth for us

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.650
It's similar to what they said

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.730
The function of QA is owned by engineering

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.810
There is no dedicated QA team three people three different companies

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.970
Somebody else says QA is a skill set and present on every team or I work so it says QA

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:38.210
What's QA and then in parentheses says engineers write automated tests and do manual aggression testing and it goes on and on and on

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.450
It's a long thread and there's good discussion on it, too

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.850
I don't want to go into that but this is something

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.330
This is a thread like you expect to see on one of the three dot slack comm plug

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.970
You can go to modern testing org enjoying that but to see this pop up

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.830
The thing we're talking about with modern testing

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.930
It's happening frickin everywhere and a lot of people are just blind to it and it bugs me

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.930
So here is my question

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.890
Two and I think I've asked this before to our listeners and by the way if you're listening to this podcast

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.450
Thank you

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:18.850
I don't really know who would but you're cool and I like you and I appreciate you listening because it just blows me away that

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.090
About a thousand of you a month listen every month and go. Hey, I'm gonna do this again in two more weeks

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.720
I I

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.880
Feel like there's a chunk and maybe it's the title of the podcast which are not gonna change

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.720
But I feel like there's a chunk of people who would benefit from this podcast a big chunk that we're not reaching

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.750
And I don't know how to reach them

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.650
Actually, I do have some ideas, but I'm gonna pause there. How do we reach?

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.010
First you agree with me. Is there a chunk of people that were not reaching that would find this beneficial and then part two

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.230
If so, what are some ways you can think of that we should reach those folks?

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:01.450
So there absolutely is a chunk right all you have to all you have to do to prove that

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:08.670
And you in particular can do this. I'm not certain I can but you in particular good. All you have to do is go to Twitter and

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.410
Just just copy paste one of the principles in particular like principle five like even today

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.230
Maybe that could be a heuristic when Alan

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:26.110
Quarterly will will copy paste principle five into his Twitter feed and then we just count how many hate responses

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.910
Alan gets and and see if that starts to temper down, you know, I should do it

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.790
I should just post a principle a week and I should probably do some more

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:44.510
Conferences but not test conferences and talk about the podcast there. I never really fully made that transition

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.830
I was kind of in the process of it and then

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:53.810
Then Covid so that's something else like I should really I'm gonna actually put that into my to-do list here

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:01.510
Speaking of actual dev or DevOps conference and I may have to start over like I got so lazy with test conferences

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.610
I get at least a request a week to speak at some test conference

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.450
I say no to almost all of them, but it's easy. Oh, that one's cool

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.090
Or I like that, you know ministry of testing looking at you. I like you. I'll always when you ask I'll always do it

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:19.970
Right. Honestly, I'm I'm a little bit in the echo chamber there and I probably just need especially now things are remote

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.970
I don't have to travel I

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:29.130
Should probably just actually go through the old-school process of applying to speak at some dev conferences and just talk about

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.970
Quality cultures whatever I probably a lot of things I could talk about but we yeah

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:40.830
Even some modern testing a B testing stuff. I'm actually wondering like based on what you just said

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
I'm wondering if that's even needed

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:48.390
Right because if you talk about Devco things like the stats that you just shared

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.660
I mean, it's not really stats. It's it's sort of a small sample set

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.300
essentially

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:03.140
The universe is moving on in the direction that we've been talking about for who knows how many friggin years now

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.140
It might already be past the tipping right it we've had conversations

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.700
We have we've had conversations around

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.700
How big is the bubble we're in?

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.880
Right in and now I'm actually wondering. Okay are are are we actually in the bubble or

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.040
We just think we're in the bubble because we have

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.440
We're bumping up against the bubble

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.280
But are we the ones that are in it or is it is it the traditionalists that are now in the bubble and that bubble?

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.500
shrinking because as

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.780
Like I'm seeing over and over again that the world is in fact not functioning

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.960
The way it did 20 years ago. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.840
It's actually segues really well into the first topic how long we've been talking about this

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.720
Well, we didn't know what modern testing was

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.680
We don't were sure exactly what we were gonna talk about when the podcast formed very early on like in the first

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.840
Few episodes we began talking about the ways which this works we explored it

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.120
We talked about it as I was learning sort of how to make that transition myself

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:16.240
But then five years ago, which I got a note in Twitter that five years ago

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.640
Someone asked me about what I thought the future of test was actually asked about ten people what they thought the future of test

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.280
was and

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.920
Because Covid has blurred it. I thought blurred time. I

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.200
Thought five years ago. Jeez, what was I was that Xbox? When was that?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.160
And no five years ago was towards the end of my time at Microsoft

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.360
I've been at Unity now about four and a half years actually a little bit more

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.840
But they asked me five years ago. What was the question? The question I was asked five years ago was

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:54.850
Blah blah blah preface preface. What will software development look like in one three or five years?

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.930
How will that impact testing approaches?

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:03.890
I guess I chose five and I'll skip all the other people that my answer is actually in hindsight is contradictory

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.690
because I said at first I said

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.970
Nothing super different

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:16.890
I expect that more companies even those not shipping weekly or more often will still move toward more agile ish engineering approaches

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:23.330
Smaller aeration smaller batches build measure learn data collection and analysis will also continue to grow in importance and use I

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.250
think I wrote that from a little bit of a bubble because those things have definitely taken off and

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:35.770
Maybe I assumed there was more of those around than I thought from a Microsoft bubble bit outside. Definitely see more of that stuff

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.250
Also said to me. It means more teams forget about what to call people

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.800
Integrated or unified engineering teams become more of the norm and dedicated test teams become rarer and rarer

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.680
I think I nailed that one

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.600
The good testers will be fine on those teams as I expect is more teams move in this direction

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.440
They recognize the need for a quality specialist among an engineering team

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.600
So I feel like we're seeing more and more of that this idea of a test coach

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.840
Which I had been doing for a while at that time is almost mainstream

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:12.310
Mm-hmm. I said, I don't know that any of that changes testing approaches and even five years ago

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:19.510
I said software developers are certainly capable of writing good unit functional integration tests and more and they'll be doing a lot more of

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:25.780
This and if you recall a few months ago and I wrote an article talking about how they could do this the hate I took

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.780
About well our developers don't want to do that and I'm better at it. So I should do it anyway, etc

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:37.740
Etc, but all this stuff is happening and I think it was it was pretty much I didn't take a risk in the prediction

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.260
I don't think you I still so I didn't I didn't take a risk at all. All these things I think were pretty well

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.060
predictable and

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.580
In hindsight, I'm a little surprised we haven't moved even farther

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:54.260
I think sometimes we think five years is a long long time for change big changes to happen across the industry

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:59.780
But they just don't go like that. So we could I could be well well into retirement and

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.980
sipping a

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.560
senior special my tie at a beach somewhere watching the

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.390
planet burn and

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:18.470
There will still be somebody spinning up a test automation team totally disconnected from the dev team so they can do their automated freakin checking

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.720
Yeah, actually I'm looking at the website I do think their predictions are spot-on

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.400
I notice that other people in here like Jerry Weinberg's in here. I miss Jerry I do too

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.900
I don't want to I'm trying to scan it and it's not

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.100
For the listeners because I probably forget to put a link in the show notes because I'm freaking lazy

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.940
My five for Friday today does include a link to this you can check it out there

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.300
And then merit had a really good follow-up approach merit who was on episode. I'm gonna guess

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.780
128

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:04.980
Somewhere last year wrote a blog post about following up on her predictions and and you know, I feel a little I have to say

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.380
When someone who's English is a second language emeritus a self-professed polyglot

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.380
She she speaks and write several languages

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:17.580
She writes better than I do as a native English speaker and it's just I don't say intimidated

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.140
I'm not sure what the word is how I feel about that, but it's I feel

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.460
Definitely impressive and awesome and I feel a little like why can't I be a better writer?

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.780
I bet she's very prolific too and she practices but she's really good

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.820
I read all of her blog articles and this one particularly good. So unplanned plug go merit

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.020
Yeah, I'm looking like it's interesting. I'd like to see her follow up

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:49.040
Yeah, it's also also in my five for Friday link so you can check that out and then Bach is in here as well

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.520
Yep, everybody has lots of I love it. Look got lots of opinions, but worth talking about today

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.620
I wanted to bring that up what happens in the next five years. What do you think?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.200
Is it just more of the same? What's something I'm gonna ask you is on the spot

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.880
What's something that's gonna happen in the next couple of years? You don't have to time bound it

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.380
that

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.140
People may find surprising. What's something that you think?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.980
May happen in the next couple of years one to three to five years that maybe a lot of people aren't expecting

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.260
Yeah, you know what this I'm suffering a

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:31.160
A flashback because I feel like we've done this on the podcast. Well, we do our we do our prediction episode

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:38.140
Like I I'm actually seriously thinking are we now on the on the path to

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:44.620
To start developing the postmodern testing principle. No, no, I think next five years

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.200
My I definitely see momentum continuing in this direction

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:58.360
Because I do think I do think what is the there was this one book that Al Shalloway talked to me about

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.400
Right, but it's essentially

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.240
We're now talking about things that are mainstream not we're not on the leading edge with them

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.400
MTP not at all when we started talking about this we were we were kind of more on the leading edge

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.600
Cuz we were observing and when I first talked about it at test bash a couple years ago

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.520
When we first heard the public talk about it, I actually used I used the what's the curve?

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.040
Yeah

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.000
The the the pace of innovation curve, which is actually from somebody else's work

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.240
But anyway, I showed that modern testing was out towards the front

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.840
But it's not it's not totally mainstream, but it's definitely to the big part of the curve. It's not a bizarre idea

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.120
There's too many people

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.680
There's too many people doing things we describe as modern testing without even knowing what the hell modern testing is and that's fine

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.720
It's absolutely fine. And then what I'm saying is it's far more mainstream today than it was when we started

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.320
Working on what are the principles?

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.280
Conversation I just reading from another slack where oh, yeah

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.400
devs owning this stuff and understanding they can and teams being data driven and

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.600
Shipping in small chunks to get feedback from customers all that stuff is happening. Yeah

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.440
so the thing is like in the context of testing or in

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.640
automated

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.640
Checking I

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:28.040
As you already covered, I don't know what's happening on the front the front lines of that. I'm sure things are

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.240
But in terms of testing or checking

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.480
Honestly, I don't care. Oh, yeah

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.040
That's so far outside. I don't want to get into that stuff. I've kind of decided that with

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.880
With checking versus testing with if you find value in it, but what the heck go ahead

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:53.720
I don't but that's me you be you know, but in terms of in in terms of the question you asked like the prediction

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.680
I mean, maybe you have a better one. Yeah

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:02.440
Well nobody's what I'm basically saying is I don't think I'm currently in a position where I would be able to actually

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:08.440
Sort of say put my finger in the air and say what's coming next as it relates to testing

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.080
Right. Oh, yeah, it's a release of quality

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.120
Yeah, let's let's let's have that discussion. But as it relates to testing, I don't have that visibility

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.780
It's it's it's out of my life. Yeah

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.500
Yeah

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:31.260
Where where we came from before it was still very much in both of our lives and we had seen much better

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:37.820
Techniques and and and actually even experienced them and rolled them out. We were definitely

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:44.820
Coming from a point of experience and we developed the the MTP. Yeah. Yeah

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:52.900
So I want to pause you there because everything is segueing so well and I want to jump in at the segue point

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.500
Okay, you don't know how these things segue I send because

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.420
There was a time when Brent and I would both contribute to a bolded list

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:07.100
We prioritize but Brett now phones in the podcast and I send them a list and tell them what we're talking about in advance

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.140
But going from there

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.660
I've been listening to

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.780
The testing peers podcast and you should check it out

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:20.420
It's they get three or four people to talk about I have a nice conversation about different things around testing. I like it

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.560
There is the one before last they actually brought up principle number five and they didn't poo-poo it

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:33.800
They said they said oh, yeah that makes sense. It fit in with their thoughts that ultimately the customer

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.360
The customer determines what quality is which goes back to something I wrote in an article which is I think is worth

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.800
Again, I just kind of tweet these little sound bites more often to get people thinking about what we do here with modern testing

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.280
But the point I brought up in that article and I'm all over the place

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.680
Gotta loop it all in and meanwhile my dog decides she wants to play just brought her toy so she could play while I talk

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.800
That's gonna be fun. Somebody in that podcast this last one

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.080
Said made the statement. We're talking about quality

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.320
They said well at least nobody brought up that quality is conformance to requirements

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.420
Actually, I believe that quality is conformance to requirements

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:15.400
But only the customer can define those requirements not some PM somewhere, right?

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:22.000
And if you put that twist on it all of a sudden, yeah Crosby's right quality is conformist to requirements. So ha

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.760
Anyway, they that was the one about quality this last one. They did a cool thing

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.400
I don't want to steal their bit entire like as an ongoing thing, but I'm gonna steal it today

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:39.360
I'm gonna tell you what they did talk about one of the conversations they had and then we're gonna do it ourselves

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.240
You have no idea what any of that means. I'm gonna walk you through it

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.960
It's kind of like when you're playing one of those complicated games for the first time you have no idea what to do. So

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.880
Let me talk about test sphere. Have you seen test sphere cards?

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.840
No, these are from ministry of testing

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.760
They're super freaking cool and what they are is a bunch of cards and different kinds of topics

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.360
and I just have the standard set here and

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.300
Just discussion starters around quality and testing. I can't find the exact card. I may not have it

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.440
They have like a because they're all cool. They have like a bonus deck full of stuff

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.340
But what they did is they kind of spun a wheel or they chose random cards to talk about it was pretty cool

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.840
but one thing they talked about and I know we've talked about this a long time in the past but

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.320
It's something that I'm you know serendipitously or coincidentally. I'm not even sure what the difference is

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.520
It's come up with me a couple times recently is they were talking about

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.680
Something about you creates a regression test for a bug that was found

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.280
Three years later. You're still running that regression test

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.540
Because once we especially with automated tests once we write them they run forever

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:52.240
These tests never the situation were that regression test you wrote that test for a bug that was in the product

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.640
It's impossible for it to happen again

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.760
You can't actually make that bug happen again because has something to do with like a particular version of Chrome

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.440
That's three years old or whatever and that regression test remains even though it provides no value

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.120
It can never actually find another bug some of those my words

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.960
One thing they didn't get to they talked about

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.600
They had a lot of things to talk about it

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.660
But one thing that doesn't get talked about enough in the industry is

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.820
Because I've been I've listened in on two or three of these things via Twitter and LinkedIn in this podcast

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:29.620
Is the idea of test selection this idea of specifically choosing certain tests to run in a certain situation and thus

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.410
choosing other tests not to run and I wonder if

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.500
Well one with developers writing the bulk or most or all of these tests

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.130
Do you think they'll fall into that same trap of running every regression test and ever release?

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:50.090
Will they be quicker to retire tests or the or will they do what I think you and I have both done in

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:56.410
The past and write a smart test selection engine to make sure they're selecting the proper tests for whatever they're changing

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:03.290
I think none of the above Oh better. What what happens? I think by the time that that becomes problematic

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.650
Right the the thing that's happened

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:13.270
What were the friends that we just talked to rocket? I think that that company I think by the time that matters

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:19.530
Actually, the tooling will improve to automatically do that. It'll become part of the tool

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:27.900
Right. So the one benefit that that the industry that the industry has in my view around test

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.500
That the the testing responsibility primarily be being shouldered by

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.980
Developer is as as I actually said in that podcast

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.150
developers are inherently lazy and

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:49.190
Of course with with with the the advent of cloud like one of the reasons that that

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:54.070
We had we had to do this test selection thing is because

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.030
like our our code

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.170
Depending on which team was doing it, right?

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.470
It had varying degrees of being able to parallelize

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.570
Everyone had like it back in the day. Everyone had labs and and

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.050
Those labs were of limited resources

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:17.690
So we had to go we ended up being forced to go to test selection because we our test pass had to complete by this date

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.930
We now had too many tests to run them all

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:24.090
Now and with the cloud the story is going to get changed

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.530
We're not going to hit the issue of having

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:35.290
Too few resources to run it because the the cloud offers sort of unlimited capacity

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.810
Well, I mean you still pay for that. You're still that's what I'm going to get to

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.450
but I compute

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.850
You pay for both commute and compute

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.370
That's where I was getting to like it becomes a new constraint and it's going to be it's the cost

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:55.050
So now actually test selection said turns into more of an roi statement. Okay

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.690
Given the cost of this test

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.570
What's the predicted value of the of the result of the test?

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.450
Cost is readily computable today

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.870
It's the the relative value of that that needs to be operationalized

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.750
And that to me is just a matter of time

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.390
my brain was spinning from the beginning when you said the tools were going to get there because

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.750
I'm tempted to quit my job today. I could I

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.070
I have done so much with test selection and I am so confident

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:29.230
I could write a generic thing that people could use to plug in and select tests based on

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:34.590
I mean, I just want to make my startup right now and make a test selection tool for the industry

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.750
Do you want to stop talking about it so that no i'm good i'm good

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:44.430
I'm probably that's not really going to happen because i'm i'm far too lazy to do that. I like the day-to-day challenges of

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.570
of

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.570
working at my current job, but

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.580
honestly if

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:57.420
You know that that's a there's a business there and I am happy to be i'm on the advisory board for one

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.100
Test automation company and so if you want to spin this up

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:07.900
Put me on your board and i'll just take some stock for me to help you make your billion dollar test selection business

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.980
Give me a ping because I I know i've done this multiple times. I know how to do it

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.060
I think I could make we could make it in a way that could be applied at multiple companies

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.540
Um, but yeah i'm available

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.820
But definitely on a board consulting type

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:30.060
Uh position more than quitting my day job because I like getting I like getting a twice a month paycheck

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.860
So yeah, yeah, but but again if you just have to share ideas and you know

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.200
Free money of any sort rolls in you know

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.400
net positive

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.000
Yes, so

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.080
What's interesting in the modern so that was?

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.800
Listening then talk about it. It was cool because that came up

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.880
They never talked about test selection and I don't hear people talk about it enough

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:57.320
So they just wanted to plant that seed for all three of the listeners. So, uh, thanks for that

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.720
But it made me think it might be fun

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.640
today

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.760
To for me to randomly pick some of these cards here

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.240
Because what I found was this is not just like oh, I want to copy them

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.280
What I found was for every question they asked

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.560
They were answering it like a I don't want to say a traditional tester

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:22.360
But more like you'd expect a tester to answer it and not the way you and I would answer it

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Oh picking up what i'm laying down

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.880
Yeah

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.880
So this is not quite traditional

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.480
I mean we could do this and we could do the traditional manager versus agile manager

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.880
But we're not going to do that or modern modern test manager

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.360
I do want to pick a couple random cards

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.000
And i'll actually random within a

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.520
A subset so there's some blue cards which are quality aspects. There's green cards which techniques

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.800
Probably do one of a couple of these see if we can do it

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:54.360
I grabbed a quality aspects card, which is blue and what they do is they have a statement at the top and then some

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.400
Supporting statements below and we'll just kind of see where this takes us. And if it's done, we'll talk about something else

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.200
This one is the usability aspect

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.840
Will users find the product convenient and easy to work with but more important will they enjoy it?

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.920
Hey, I picked a principle five call card

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:17.320
And the state supportive statements below are what makes an app attractive speed ease of use reliability question mark

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.520
Are the most important features available in the middle of your screen?

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.840
Have your app. I track tested to find out people easily find what they're looking for

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.440
Some things are intrusive yet. People love them. For example the group on space cat logo. I haven't seen it

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.160
This makes your app unique identify memorable

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.680
So i'm gonna go back to the top and have you answer this from a eric reese modern testing point of view

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.240
Okay, how do you know if users are finding the product convenient and easy to work with?

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.060
well, my my my

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.980
50 000 level answer is that they are the

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.500
They are showing that they are solving the problem

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.020
That they're solving problems with it with a ui app

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.300
I think the way I would look at it is

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.280
Is from a kpi standpoint and I would look at uh, what's called the dow mau

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.800
uh

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.480
Uh equation is basically am i've seen

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:22.120
Am I seeing repeat visits from the same customer? Am I am I am I observing that there is stickiness with?

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.010
With the customer. Yeah in general

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.570
So in short data, let's talk about that. This is where we differ like this is where this is

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.290
I think my answer is going to be data on every one of these

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:40.250
Let's talk about how we'd use data here because this middle statement says are the most important features available in the middle of your screen

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.890
Well, it isn't for the tester to decide but those most important features are

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:51.050
Right, you can you can gather that from data are the things people using the most most easily accessible

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:57.690
Or how how difficult are some of the things that uh, they're using a lot to find

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:04.350
Well, and even then like there is there is a concept that's coming up in the data science space

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.470
That's that for me been coming up more and more

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.030
Right. How do you define most?

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:15.550
The you that user's most because here's here's one thing i'll call out that a lot of

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.930
At that when you start doing basic sort of data analysis, it's very attractive

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.830
To go after and target the average

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:29.790
Okay, but here's the deal and there's multiple stories on on this that I could share

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.950
but

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.950
There's actually no one that is

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.910
That fits into the average persona. Uh-huh. You're right

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.990
Nobody no pilot is the actually the average height for a pilot

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.990
Actually, yeah. Yeah, uh, there was a recent story that

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.230
On that same topic where back in world war something

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.110
Where they designed the cockpits

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.230
And they designed the competes for the average

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:04.110
Uh pilot right they they measured height they measured weight they measured chest size etc. Okay

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.910
and of course

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.790
No one actually fit in the plane and in

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.110
hindsight 2020

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:17.230
They looked at and that was one of the main causes for why there were accidents in the plane

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:24.330
Because the pilots themselves like literally no one fit correct when you look at humans

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.840
Right. There's a certain studies where you'll

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.720
like the average human

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.160
Is going to have half of their body parts be male and the other half of their body parts be female

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.200
And it turns out there's no actual human that fulfills that criteria

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.880
That's one of the problems with averages and and when you try to I would I would restate the statement

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.450
like

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.260
Is what?

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.020
each individual

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.460
To what degree are each individual customer?

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.820
Finding their needs and finding that the ui

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:09.660
Is where they expect those things to be right in some places it and sometimes it may not actually be

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:18.400
Um, like for example in in the azure portal we will we have actually multiple entry points into certain aspects

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.960
uh that we know are popular because we

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.920
We want we don't want to have to try to train the customer on where to find how we hard-coded it

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.600
We want to shortcut

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.520
To okay. What are their needs here here? This is how you get to it

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.760
Yeah, I I think um, the important thing here is for that question is

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.920
And i've actually looked through a couple of these while you've been talking and they're all going to end up in data

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.480
So I may not go through many more unless I find a good one

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.000
but

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.400
A lot of testers think like we have to act like the customer will use personas and you can't you're not the customers

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:59.440
That's what principle five is about you have to use data and I have and I have to tell you I haven't used an office app in

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.520
Four years, but I assume office still has the ribbon

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.320
Yeah, okay. So when the ribbon came out it pissed a lot of people off

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.080
And a lot of people liked it. It was a good often when you innovate

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.560
Uh, you can tell you're innovating when half the people love it and half people hate it. You get a polarized

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.440
Response, but the reason they did that and I heard all kinds of theories

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.760
I was at a conference once and somebody told me

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.080
They had some wild conspiracy story on why the ribbon was the way the ribbon was and it was I was

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.800
A little shocked that someone could have that imagination

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.880
but the reason the ribbon existed and they came out with it was

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:46.480
A whole bunch of customers were requesting features that already existed in office apps. They just couldn't find them

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
And the ribbon was about trying to make sure that every feature was

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.160
Two clicks or three clicks away and taking those most important features of putting them one click away

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.040
The next level down two clicks away just making it easier

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.520
And if you have been using office for a long time, you'll remember their attempt before

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.760
Was to do this thing where they'd hide menu items. You remember this?

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:16.720
They would hide the menu items that you hadn't used recently. So you go to look and it was that was more confusing

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.400
That was a horrible solution for that customer problem

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.200
But they're able to discover that through data and lots of feedback that that wasn't working

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.640
They thought okay. We'll limit your view to the stuff you use

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.240
But there's it was there was a pain in the butt for those things you only use once in a while like mail merge

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.280
You have to go dig around and remember which menu it was in to find it. It was just ridiculous

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.760
So all that's data driven, you know, love or hate office. I haven't used it because I haven't needed it

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.160
Although honestly as a tangent if I had a windows machine, I would have excel

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.800
Just so I could run power bi

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.380
Other than that, but I don't so I don't and it's all right

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.920
anyway

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.560
Data to understand what

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.360
Challenges the customers are having how are they using the product?

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.510
right, I grabbed a card from the

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.990
The green which are techniques, but the first one I grabbed I

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.070
Is very similar to the test selection one. It's a different car

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.310
But i'm gonna go ahead and read it for you and then i'll grab and maybe i'll grab another not sure

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:33.550
It's on the sampling technique when faced with unlimited possibilities testers select the most likely options the one most prone to risks

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:36.030
Okay, so we wait what?

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.670
when faced with unlimited possibilities

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.360
Testers select the most likely options the ones most prone to risks. This is saying wait

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.080
Wait, is that a is there a comma in there or no?

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.680
I had to add I had to add commas to make it make sense

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:59.280
I will read it as written when faced with unlimited possibilities testers select the most likely options the ones most prone to risks

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.320
What they're saying is we do risk-based that we

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.680
The number of ways I could test something is indeed

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.640
basically infinite

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.880
But we do risk-based testing. Okay, I just tried to think through what

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.280
What they mean by the most likely but I got it

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:23.080
All testing is sampling. We can't run all tests. They say checks. I'm going to say tests. So we settle for a subset

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:29.240
Being honest about this keep this in mind. What keeps us humble? Yes, of course risk-based testing means you can't test everything

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.760
Choosing which set you will test is very important

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.040
So this is all they call this sampling technique, but really it's risk-based testing

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.240
And the last one is not going to read that whole second one

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:48.760
Let's test more different variations of ordering english language books as 99 of our businesses in that module

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:55.160
So actually like this one at the end because i'm going to assume that's based on data and yeah

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.520
You can

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.840
Use all kinds of demographic data to figure out how much time you're going to spend testing

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.520
if you have a feature of your application that is

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.720
A very small subset of your customers find useful you can spend less time

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.120
Both adding new features to that section or testing that section for the product

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.120
But i'm not sure what else to add to that one other than

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.560
I don't know any comments on that one before I grab one from

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.320
The most

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.320
the most likely the ones

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.670
Right. What was the last statement the something around most likely though?

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.710
What they're saying is this one isn't super well written, but but what they're basically saying is

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:37.930
because

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.830
99 of our business is in

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.710
ordering english language books

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.670
Let's wait our testing in that area

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.660
Oh, okay

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.020
Yeah, to me that makes sense

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.200
So if you have a limited test selection, you're going to want to prioritize

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.140
The way I always phrase it is you're going to want to prioritize the tests

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:06.300
That's kind of gonna okay gonna have the biggest oh shit factor if they fail we're gonna do a lightning round

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.500
All right. I'm gonna read you a heuristic and you're gonna say

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.540
Tell me whether you can solve that problem with data

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:19.340
Or not data. So the game is data and not data. I just made this up. All right. All right data

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.920
Yes, all right. What's the next question data a product that is hard to explain might be too hard for a user to understand

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.930
Data

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:33.850
We all have expectations of the world around us. Our app should be no exception

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.960
I can't parse that one. Okay, fine

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:43.360
I'll just default to data. There is much to learn from earlier versions. What did they tell you about risk and failure?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.240
Oh data is your product true to the image and reputation you or the app's company wishes to project

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:57.040
I've been saying mix on that. Okay. Are your competitors doing things different maybe even in a better way?

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.680
Uh data if you have it

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.560
That's going to be another mix. I'm I'm I'm I'm uh, created a third choice. Okay

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.080
What's the third choice mix

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:14.240
Yeah data no data mix. Okay, so i'm basically viewing it now as quantitative qualitative or both

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.400
All right. Can your product live up to the hype?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
That's got to be both. Okay

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.520
What are the user's desires and does the product live up to them?

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.440
That's both does the product solve a problem will it fulfill its ultimate mission data?

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.100
Your app will have to adhere to standards norms regulations or the law

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.050
Um that for sure is both. Yep

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:42.330
What can you learn from a workflow by executing it in opposite order or a different order?

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:46.970
I I can't parse that one. I think that's data. What they want to know is

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.490
Is if someone goes off the happy path will they still be successful?

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:57.850
Yeah, the way I interpret workflow is like a sequence of steps and how do you execute it in reverse order, right? It's a sequence

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.810
How does your app handle zeros and negatives?

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.370
Okay, i'm inventing

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:06.890
A fourth option. All right, man. Don't care. Don't care. Great

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.330
Dev's job

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:16.410
I think I think we have another one for category four blank fields too many records or exactly one input can lead to horrible errors

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.620
Yeah, dev

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:23.340
When we look at uh, i'm gonna do there's four more things i'll do for heresics and we'll stop but all right

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:28.220
But i'll pause there because when we one thing we can look at which should exist is

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.860
Error rates what errors are customers seeing? Yes. How many are they seeing?

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.140
Uh, it's it's a great denominator. So you say

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.860
you might see oh we had

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.900
10 000 users last month and

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:48.540
A thousand of them encountered errors and a hundred of them encountered more than 20 errors per session

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.790
Yep, we can go look at that and figure out what to do

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:58.670
What is wrong with these people and they all live in texas or something and and desantis shut off their internet who knows?

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.830
uh, but we can

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:05.230
If we have those areas we can dig in and debug and i've talked about this before but

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.270
Worth a pause here before we finish this up is

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.110
I love to debug from data

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:19.630
I like to look at an anomaly and then dig in and figure out why what's unique about this anomaly?

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.710
What's going on here? Why?

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:26.030
Did this customer get this error? Oh, that is absolutely my favorite thing to do

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.790
And just to be clear. I don't think brent's being sarcastic

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.620
No, it's not. It's not

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:39.500
I'll tell you why because once I find the answer to that question and then I can generalize it to okay

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.620
How well does this broaden in terms of impact?

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.780
I will say 50 of the time it allows me to

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:54.780
To do my even more favorite thing to do and that is go to the executives and inform them that their business is not

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.900
Operating the way they think it is. Yeah, but

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.860
I even did that that's that's on big scale

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:05.900
But I remember even on we had so much data on even on the xbox console that

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.860
We would hear customers having an error with something

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.980
So we go look in the data and find out who was having that error

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.460
Then we check on all the different things about them and slowly like what's in common

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.060
It's just like debugging with the debugger, but we're just kind of going through we're doing sql queries instead of debugger commands

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.980
And in the end you find out if they're on a certain version of the console and they have this game installed and they have

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.660
More than two controllers set up they get this error. Yeah

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.300
Love that so much fun

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:40.940
There is so I think I may have shared with them the podcast that one of one of my team's key missions is around

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.740
Uh, we call it support supportability

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:50.080
One of the kpis that manages sort of success and supportability

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.620
is

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.220
self-help solution

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.220
Okay, and that's to the degree

00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:01.020
Do we publish documentation and bring that documentation to the customer?

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:09.820
On their ability to to understand the docket and actually solve it themselves like they don't actually need to engage support

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.940
Actually, it's funny that you brought the errors thing up

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.060
Because literally just this week I was in a meeting on a very similar context

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.110
and

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:24.170
the kpi

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:26.810
Just it's very simply measured

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.370
Like the numerator is

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:32.890
the number of people that that deflected

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:40.890
Uh a case that we deflected them from entering a case. That's the numerator and then the denominator is the number of people

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:48.250
That went into that that particular problem space that that were deflection opportunities and one of the things

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.330
I stated for the first time actually this week

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.370
that was controversial, uh because

00:43:56.330 --> 00:44:01.530
Everybody everybody is focused on the numerator the numerator. How do we get that numerator to 100%?

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.930
How do we deflect all of these things and I said, yeah, I just want to let you know

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:12.410
I'm I'm actually no longer interested in the numerator. I care about the denominator. I want to drive that to zero

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.570
How do I get the customers?

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:17.770
No longer having problems in this space

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:24.030
Because if I get them to know how to have no longer having problems then I don't care if we even have documentation

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:28.750
Right. They don't need to go and click it. How do we improve our platform?

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:34.110
To be smarter to actually solve it in the first place. Yep. I use the left shift

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:41.870
Language like our goal is to bring solutions to the customers. It's the absolute most tragic of a fail

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.830
If a customer does go through

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:48.430
Through support and walks away feeling like they did not get a solution

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:49.950
but we've been

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.230
A lot of companies and microsoft included has sort of been

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.910
Optimizing for a safety net around around the support staff

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:06.270
But that's expensive and that's manually driven and and it it at some point in time

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:11.550
It fails to scale. Yeah, if you if your customer has to call support you're losing money

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.400
In our case, not so much. All right. Well in general, I would say that's true

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.640
Yeah in general, I would say that's potentially true like with microsoft

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.560
right now for

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.040
For for the majority of our support topic or support plans

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.800
These are add-ons that that customers actually need to buy

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:36.880
And so people who are going in and creating creating these support cases in some degree

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.040
They've already decided that they're going to be active on the on the platform

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.040
but

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.200
Even if you want to keep that model

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.960
Right you want then more people to to funnel into it. How do we get more people buying?

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.080
finding so much value and it's worthwhile to

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.160
uh

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.960
Buy a support plan. I get it. I get it. So

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.720
One of the thing I wanted to mention so I got excited thinking about debugging through data

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:08.000
I didn't know we're gonna get here when we started but i'm glad I remembered that but it reminded me a thing we did

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.320
even on teams

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.200
There's something I liked a lot about what we did on teams and it was a

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.000
A dirt simple solution and almost lazy, but it was great

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.800
We had a in the beta

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.800
We had a form where a message care how it worked

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.760
We had a way for any customer using our product internal external to just give

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:36.660
plain text feedback, of course, we had we had data on error rates on the server side that people could give us

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.060
Any sort of feedback we wanted and they and we dump it into a database

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.940
And we'd never look at it

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.100
directly, at least never on purpose

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.180
but

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.060
What we got is we just wrapped an elastic search

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:59.620
Elastic search around that data and then when somebody internally would say hey i'm seeing something weird where the uh

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.060
The fonts are really small. I go we go. I wonder if customers are seeing this

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.230
Small font and we see okay. Here's five reports. What's going on there?

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:13.550
and we get a much more context and information on why that may happen or

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.800
daily usually someone would just type crash

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:22.350
And see if if if a lot of customers reporting crashes, but it's a pretty

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:29.870
It ended up being a pretty cheap way to kind of check on the pulse of what of customer feedback

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.940
Because there's no way to look at all of it, but I wanted but we collected it all so we'd have it for

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.740
Often you get something from like satya's office. You want to know is this a

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.780
butts and chairs figure this out or a

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.780
A one-off thing. We just need to go over and babysit someone through and having

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:49.420
being able to pull from

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:55.420
A thousand entries a day on random feedback from customers gave us a way to see if those are things that are really happening

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.500
But you you seem like you don't like this

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.980
No, no, no, I I like it very much

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:06.140
Uh, but question I think I missed it. Did you say that's in teams or in unity? No, we did that in teams

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.540
Okay, do you do something? No, not yet

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.460
But okay

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.590
all right, so

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:18.350
Do you have a pad and paper? I'm going to give you some terms. I want you to go talk to your data science team

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:21.040
and

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.240
Do your charismatic hand wavy?

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.720
Fucking do the shit that alan asked you to do thing. Okay, i'm listening

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.640
You need to get a feedback stream going just like you did in teams

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.240
That's number one like obviously your data science team is not going to be able to do that

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.160
You're going to have to talk to your desk. I I can populate that. Yeah, okay

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.200
Then what you want?

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.520
Is against that stream

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.680
You want your data science team to produce a daily?

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.740
TF idf

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.940
Vector

00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:02.180
Okay, and what a tf idf is a is an nlp algorithm and what a basic fuck it's damn

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:07.220
I don't know what it means. No it's term frequency. It stands for term frequency

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.580
That's cool. I got it. I got what else verse document, okay

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.940
Then what you want to do is do anomaly detection against that vector

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.640
Okay, and wouldn't you have done that?

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.380
What you will now have

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.140
Is a feed that tells you in near real time

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.100
when certain terms

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:35.250
Are anomalous and starting to appear in your feedback stream

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.930
In other words instead of what you did with teams

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:40.930
where

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.410
Customers provided feedback and you looked at it

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:51.250
You know when when reactively when someone decided to care you're now going to have a feed that tells you

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:56.770
Hey something weird is happening and the customers know about it before we do

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:03.760
You turn it to near real time reaction instead of hmm. I wonder if anyone's ever talked about this

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.560
That is cool. So now what I wanted so another thing no i'm excited

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.120
Okay, we don't have a lot of time to talk about this. But another thing I want to do is

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.120
Again xbox live use this i'm sure a lot of teams did this. This is actually similar to this is um

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.320
Just a sentiment analysis on all the different feedback streams where people can give feedback. What's your what's your view on sentiment analysis?

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:32.750
Sentiment analysis. So if you have the right data set and if you have customers that are providing sentiment

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:39.870
Um, it's it's handy. Uh, but but what i'm what i'm hearing in your voice is what I really want is the ti

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:41.870
Tfidf vector

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:47.550
Well, so that one's easy and it should work with your data set. That's the problem is you need like

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.630
You need near office level degree of usage

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:55.390
Because customers don't generally provide feedback, right?

00:50:56.030 --> 00:51:03.230
Uh, the the response rate is rather low like two three five seven percent. Yeah, I thought more like two I think is is is

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.070
Going going well

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:11.230
So to do something useful with data science on that one you need a lot of users

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:18.590
And I I don't know if unity is at that space in terms of where they have customer feedback stuff, but

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:20.770
Yeah, certainly

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:26.690
And you know no product plans here i'll do this for the part of the product that I ship which is um documentation

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.330
But it's a place where right feedback

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:34.530
and the other thing that is problematic with sentiment analysis is

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:40.450
Do you remember back when you were at microsoft when we did, uh the peer feedback?

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:43.090
where where

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.090
You know you you had to ask

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:49.490
20 people to give you peer feedback and then they would answer

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:56.130
Uh, these these questions that scaled from one to five and and then some random text that like ms 360

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.730
Right to what degree did you find that useful?

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:03.170
To it. I I found it. I found it useful to a degree

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:06.290
a very slight degree, right?

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.690
then the problem the reason why is um

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.080
Anything that was sort of constructive feedback

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.520
A lot of the times end up being overblown constructive, right?

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:23.280
Because it's somebody that actually hates your guts and now their interaction with you was personal

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.920
Um, but over overall the majority of time you you get oh sure

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.400
555 allen is perfect in every way

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.140
Which doesn't help you grow doesn't help you improve

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.500
right, so

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:41.380
What what I got from from mine was and we do need to close her i'm late for another meeting is uh

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:47.410
I I met with the hr person to go over with me and they said alan everyone your work with

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.330
Thinks you do great work and they love how you get it done

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.210
But they kind of think you're an asshole

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.040
And this was very early in my microsoft career. All my role models were assholes

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.160
And that's when I began. Oh I can you're right

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.080
But I was kind of almost told that was the way I had to do it

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.520
That's that it was at that point. I began to actually learn

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.400
How to read people and build an emotional quotient and think about how I was coming across

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:20.480
Which is the only reason i'm still employed thought I kept on being an asshole to get stuff done and left bodies in my wake

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.520
And not been and burned bridges right and left or to get done what I wanted to get done

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
I'd be in a different place in my career

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:32.430
Yeah, but when we both started at microsoft, I mean, that's how you get shit done

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:35.790
Yep, exactly back in the day. All right, man. Uh

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.150
We better close it up here so I can get going but this was fun

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:44.990
Uh always good surprising you with agenda items the last minute and see how you react but again you get an a plus

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:46.670
Data

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:52.270
And the the answer is all the data. Yeah. All right. Uh, thanks everyone for listening. I am

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.140
Alan and I am brent. All right, man. See you later
