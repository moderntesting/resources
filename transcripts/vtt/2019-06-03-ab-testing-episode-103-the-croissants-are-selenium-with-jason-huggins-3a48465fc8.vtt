00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:21.710
The modern testing podcast join your hosts Alan and Brent. I am mindless agile robot. I must iterate

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:30.820
As we talk about software engineering software quality leadership and whatever else comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.800
Hey, I'm having a great day. How are you doing? I'm me too. Let's go

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.550
listeners

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.190
May recall that listen to our last episode. We went off a little bit on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.510
UI automation, would you say that it's accurate right? I went off that that's ambiguous. I would say we

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.790
We allowed our inner passions out

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.860
We did we did

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.780
Yeah, again, our rats were against UI automation

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.940
but we did refer to an enabler of that which is Selenium and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.820
Which to our credit we said was a super great tool

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.440
maybe too good because it enabled people to do dumb things and then and then stuff happened and then

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230
We got to here

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.700
We did we did and we have a very special guest today

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.720
Former works employee. Oh, hold on. Hold on. I have to I have to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.350
Build up to it. I have to create

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.590
Drama and I need some swelling music

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.350
But by the way episode 103. Thank you. Welcome to the podcast

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.590
Former Google employee former ThoughtWorks employee current founder, I believe of

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.390
Tapster robotics, but for the context of our episode

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.870
We'd like to welcome the inventor of Selenium Jason Huggins. Well, now I can say hello. Hi now you can say hello. Sorry

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.100
Yeah, we're super excited to have you here and Brent and I are gonna sit down and let you know

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.820
Well, we'll ask questions. We'll interact you seem pretty nice so far

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.560
So we're not expecting any dressing down, but we're really excited to have you here. So thank you again for

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.080
Coming and talking with us today. Thanks and I suppose as a as a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.840
courtesy to the rest of the world like this lets me

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.200
Being a guest on a podcast lets me not start my own podcast

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.160
Contribute to a proliferation of more things in the world. So what part of the world are you in right now Jason right now?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.480
I'm in Chicago just west of the city and my house in Oak Park. Gotcha

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.320
Yeah, so and you are both in the wonderful state of Washington. Yes

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.670
No, I was just thinking it cuz Alan

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.750
Ordinarily is a fantastic

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.650
Technician, I'm sure he could grease the wheels for you. And if you wanted to get a podcast going

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.950
Yeah, I think we'd like to start off with and we'll see where the discussion goes

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.270
Oh, this is we have no outline which is typical for a B testing. Sometimes we throw a little bit of a

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.670
Lean coffee list on the board. But today I just like to start with

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.950
You're you listened to episode 102. I did I'd like to hear your reaction and thoughts and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.230
Where we were what you like about it and what you maybe didn't like about it. Got it. So

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.820
It's everything you said I think like that the summary is that

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.780
The punch lines you were trying to get to at the end

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.620
I totally agree with and it's like I there's a certain level of like

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.780
A lot of the things that were said just triggered a lot of stories in my mind and I've realized like wow

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.300
Like those stories not a lot of people know those stories right like the project where Selenium came from or you know

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.540
or various

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.180
Things where I realized like oh, yeah

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.220
I totally agree with them

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.180
Like I was a horrible thing that they you know that the team decided to do or or other times like no

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.140
Anyway, it's just like just I just follow the stories and realize like some that context

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.140
Wasn't there but I was glad some of the stories got through like the story where the the name came from right whatever anyway

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.780
And that I I stumbled trying to remember like I heard this once

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.480
I hope this is true. I thought I was ready to edit that out if it wasn't I looked it up

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.540
Well, I'm writing right and so I there's this book called made to stick and ironically don't remember much of the book

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.980
however, it talks about all the different ways why ideas stick and one of them apparently

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.740
Was the the name of Selenium and where it came from

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.880
People who were kind of in the trenches for years with testing the fact that it was there to cure or sorry to slay the mercury

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.820
Monster, they thought that was very humorous

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.740
But and I didn't realize I was following following a long tradition of people very in a pun

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.740
Clever way or they think they're clever, you know, like naming something after what they think they're going against anyway

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.280
But I stumbled into where I read that I stumbled into this

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.840
I think I saw Angie Jones tweet where she kind of oh she was mad at me

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.840
She called you out and I was like, oh, oh, well, what is this?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.820
And I saw the whole thread and like wow, this is blowing up and then like wow. Okay, so listen to the whole thing

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.480
So yeah to be fair. Yes, I did feel triggered a couple times

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.900
We're like, wow, that's a bold statement. But then again, you know, well, there's a certain level of and I backed off

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.120
It's I said I and the tweet in question like ever all the listeners have seen it

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.460
I said reason I hate Selenium is because people use shitty selectors and really it's not Selenium

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.200
It's right what are enabled it and yeah, right

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.500
Yes, this conversation could go in a million directions, but

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.600
There's one of the things I was just thinking like it's specifically in the context of selectors, right?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.480
For me my relationship with the Selenium project

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.160
You know, we started the project in 2004, right? So that's a that's a lot of years

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.780
All right, and I'm not day to day on the project anymore. Right Simon Stewart

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.880
is the leader of the project now and so I'm just kind of the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.480
The old guy who next to the campfire who just you know has stories sitting in his rocking chair kind of thing like hey kid

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200
Anyway

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.840
Right, right

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.160
I like can you believe this weird sequence of events where you know that you pushed on this and then all this other stuff

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
Happened on the other side but um

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.060
Yeah, I don't know whether I should just like super stay above the frame

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.900
You know super like general or like go in like really nitty, you know, like speaking of horrible CSS selectors

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.900
Let me tell you about that story. Anyway

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.700
So Jason the first thing I hear is is

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.980
Maybe you don't agree with the the details

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.420
Or where Alan pointed the finger in his tweet, but it sounds like you agree with this sentiment

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.480
Yeah, okay. So I went back and pulled out some quotes because and

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.220
Because I wanted to make sure I got this right and the thing was it's like I totally agree with it

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.220
But there was like a context that's missing, right?

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.670
So

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.670
What was one of them?

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.450
Is the one where Brent said UI automation is immoral, oh, I like that line

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.610
Yeah, I mean, I'm kidding. I don't like that line

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:15.370
Definitely was triggered. I mean I like it in the sense of like yeah very memorable sticky controversial, but let me but more

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.650
specifically so

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.010
specifically I

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.810
Just to make sure I'm not already being misquoted

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.690
I said I believe I can make that argument and I stand by that

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.970
Yeah

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.970
Yeah

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.010
It's like where I think where is that quote there's something about a lot that the the context is

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.650
the dev teams and testing teams are separate and

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.830
I think you were was it?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.670
Why is your my testing exists?

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.910
We have to go through the top layer blah blah. Why is that because that's where that's not what they're paid for

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.510
This is because here's the line because there's a separation between testers and developers given those worlds Selenium makes sense

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.710
But I'm like no get rid of those worlds and the thing is I totally agree with that punchline

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.590
And so that the context that's kind of missing here is that Selenium

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.390
Came from a project with no testers or no testing team. We were just developers and

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.870
We were trying to get this app out the door

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.070
And there's a whole you know

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:22.410
Context of like we didn't have any functional testing tool. We went months with just unit tests and

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:30.050
Like we we we decided after months of headache and frustration a specific very specific technical problems

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:36.650
Where things were breaking in one browser and fixing the other and and Brent you mentioned this like hey in the cross browser testing context

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.610
That makes sense. So at the time this was like Firefox and IE I guess six and Firefox before it was even 1.0

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.650
It's like point eight. Anyway, so that's so we as a developer team with no testing at no testers

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.650
And a separate testing team. That's why we created this tool

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.570
And so and I've spent my career like kind of avoiding those situations where there's a separate siloed

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.770
testing team and I think maybe like where I felt compelled to kind of like, you know

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.930
put up my hand and be on the show because I feel like I'm

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.930
You're arguing for a thing that I've actually I kind of feel like I've spent all my time kind of trying to stay in

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.210
There like I kind of know about and I feel like you're also in that same spot where there is

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:20.570
Dysfunction and having these separate teams and you're actively trying to avoid that as well and and bring people along saying like doesn't have to

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.890
Be this way right? So in that sense, we're like very spiritually aligned, right?

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.770
but what I think I see and it's not so much your words, but I think I definitely see this as a trend is

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:36.490
people are forgetting that selenium started as a developer tool like for developers by developers kind of thing and I say that specifically

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.490
Because it's kind of an annoying tagline

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.770
But it but it's it's ironic that like this cypress team the cypress other the testing tool

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:49.330
They're specifically using that as a marketing tool against so on Amazon like well cypress is this quote-unquote, you know

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.770
Real for real developers, whatever. So there's this weird thing where there's this

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:03.730
And and and again like architecturally it's it's literally the implement like everything that was in Selenium one the version that was like 15 years old

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:11.090
Everything about cypress is is how we did that first version and basically I threw it all away and we merged with Simon's webdriver project

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.650
Thanks, Lenny. I'm too

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.930
So not only like to they don't know their history like they really don't know their history

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.650
Anyway, and the marketing line like that was my marketing line

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.090
Which is basically kind of like what punks do when they were trying to make some noise, right?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:27.370
But there's but I got some criticism at the at the very beginning by creators of other testing tools saying that Selenium was

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.410
too geeky the only kind of selectors we we see we

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.810
You actually kind of Allen you mentioned this like, you know add a unique ID or a data ID

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.330
That was the only thing that Selenium supported at the beginning and when people would say that like oh you should support all these other things

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.170
Like I was kind of ambivalent like yeah, sure go ahead knock yourself out go do it

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.610
But when I use this tool, I'm gonna go in the source code modify it make it so there's ID tags and whatever

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.250
so it came from like this really like it was actually like really not a

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.050
usable by most testers and

00:10:55.170 --> 00:11:00.850
Testing teams and I kind of was actively avoiding kind of working on projects where those like where there was a separate siloed

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.370
testing seems it

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.590
Scene though is testing. Sorry. Go ahead. No, see and then it got out of control. You lost that

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:15.570
Yeah, I think what happened right is is that the you know, I don't know what metaphor I'm looking for at the moment

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.210
but the the

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.570
Testers and testing teams are getting kind of pushed out of the nest if you will

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.170
Right. I kind of look at it like in two different directions. There's a whole bunch of people

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:31.050
They want to stay employed rightfully so and so they're pushed into writing more code and writing automation and that's kind of where

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:38.050
Where they end up at the Selenium meetups and Selenium conferences because like they're being pushed either pulled or pushed or whatever to like learn this thing

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:44.130
Keep their job. If nothing else like, you know learn automation become a coder and then there's another side where I think it's totally

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.240
Fine path, but I think it's it's maybe harder to find

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.960
people talking about this and arguing about it conference things like things like that but like a business analyst where you're sitting in a dashboard and

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.560
Like you're looking at like Google Analytics or some kind of thing where you're kind of

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.720
You're sitting there with a kind of a clipboard and kind of more kind of an as an analysis to maybe figuring out what needs

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.760
To get tested you're not writing code, but you're kind of like looking at the system as a whole

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.960
I think that's a totally valid track for for testers and I think what's going away is just like people just you know

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.670
Sitting there clicking a button, right? And unfortunately those kind of jobs stick around is because

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.270
Management in some level thinks that testing is sitting there clicking a button, right?

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.790
They put out a job correctly. We need a button clickers actually

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:28.710
So I don't know if you're much of a reader. We just we just met have you heard of

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:36.390
Nancy foregrounds book accelerate. I have not I am a reader, but I have not read that. Okay, I definitely recommend

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:42.190
It's Nicole Forsgren. Is it Nicole? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh Nicole. She she keynoted the

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:48.690
Sauce conference. Oh, you know what? I think I quoted her as Nancy at the webinar yesterday as well

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.590
Sorry, it's Nicole Forsgren. I'm just gonna call her dr. Forsgren. I think

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.510
So she's spent the last four years looking at

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.550
certain constructs

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.910
Particularly lean and agile type of constructs, but

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:13.550
It's studying it researching it and this book is sort of the published results of her research

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.670
and one of the things that she came out and stated is

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.470
dev

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.190
owning the the testing and the automation of the tests is

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.710
Correlated with positive business outcomes

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.510
But interestingly enough

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:38.030
Test owning and maintaining it is not correlated with business outcomes

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.350
Yeah, I about ten years ago left a QA job went to dev

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:49.530
I is like like you did not have a testing and I completely from experience

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.710
I completely see why right once you have the dev team owning it

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.230
they

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.870
Don't like like everyone else. They don't like maintaining test automation

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.030
And what you find is that they naturally?

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.750
build stronger test designs to make it easier for them to

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.230
Keep the quality high keep the system moving

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.910
Yeah, I guess I I do have to push back just on a little bit like be annoying person here

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.270
In the sense of like setting up an us versus them kind of dichotomy there

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.790
I feel like I think it gets the clicks and they're in the views

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.510
But I think there's I'm kind of sitting there imagining someone who's in that

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.540
Testing role and through no fault to their own

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.780
Well, so there's there they're there trying to figure out what's what's their kind of next move, right?

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.420
If if they're now thinking like oh, wow, okay. My role is not gonna lead to business success

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.860
I'm thinking like okay, let's not divide well because you're not don't have the title developer

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.740
Like what let kind of like let's find a way to like forget the labels for a second

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.580
Like let's actually get to that. Okay, what causes business success, right?

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.900
regardless of title or role or whatever like

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.540
What can that person do like what's some tangible thing that they so if you have an opportunity?

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.100
I'll do a pitch go back and listen to

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:11.980
The A B testing podcast say starting around episode 80. This is actually what the monitor testing principles. What was that number again?

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.720
80 80 80 started 80

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:22.110
Vintage. All right. So one of the things that is a big passion for Alan and I is we actually think that the

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:28.070
The world is very rapidly changing. We're seeing a lot of studies that sort of agree with this

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.670
it's even more than

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.430
what you started talking about earlier where

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:39.570
We see, you know test is a bunch of button clickers, right? It so that's that's been

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.420
That's been an issue ever since I've been in this in in this career

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.820
But now we're we're seeing the reason why I brought up. Dr. Forsgren's

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.180
analysis is it's it's

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.340
it will further solidify

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.780
The opinion of folks like that because now we have an expert claiming proof of it

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:07.500
So what Alan and I are doing we actually believe that these testers are extremely talented and valuable

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.380
People but we do see a we do see a threat

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.070
Pending

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.590
sometime soonish

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:21.070
And that could be measured in decades, but we see this rapidly accelerating

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.030
And so what we're trying to do is reach them and say hey

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.910
Start investing yourself start finding a new role

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:35.750
Right you one of my favorite ways of describing this is you can either be the butterfly or you can be the wind

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.670
we need

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.670
people to to

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.790
Recognize that this is a possibility and hey if we're wrong

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.820
They've invested in themselves and they've grown themselves if we're right

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.900
Then they still they won't be part of the the

00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:01.620
Yeah, the colon I guess for lack of a word. I guess we're again where I felt compelled to say hey, okay

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.940
Let's talk. I think I had kind of that gist of that again kind of a random metaphor coming out of my brain

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.020
It's like it sounded like you were sitting in a cafe in England

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.740
Complaining about the croissants and saying gosh, I can't wait to get out of England

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.460
Let's get to France and we'll never have to deal with croissants anymore, right? It's like

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.180
You know metaphorically so croissants are plenty anyway

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.020
And so there's a certain feeling of like I'm sitting here going like I'm sitting in France thinking like wow

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.060
I'm surrounded by all these croissants or selenium or whatever my metaphor is I hope it's making sense

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.100
But there's a certain level of like you know that these I totally get this whole like

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.020
encouraging

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.700
Empowering testers, but I guess I'm here to say like selenium is on the other side. I was on the other side, right?

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.980
It's it's there and I guess that was the point so I guess the show's over now

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.860
I'm working. Okay. Wait, who's the croissant is selenium the croissants?

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.380
Once if we can just get rid of the Selenium stuff and get testers into like more like awesome

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.900
Like like follow these principles right then then no more Selenium and I'm here to say like well

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.140
Actually when you're following all those principles Selenium came out of that environment. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so what I don't

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.980
If if if what we said last episode got interpreted that way

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:30.340
Yeah, that's false, but I think but I also kind of agree in the sense of I think this is the true of like any

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:37.950
Dare I say like popular thing right like Selenium's popular, but like so are like PHP right like any kind of popular language or framework or whatever

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.630
eventually

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.790
There's a lot of low-hanging fruit to make fun of right because there's so many people

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.550
Doing bad things with it. And so that there's a certain level of like this is it just it's a big target

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:55.430
So let's let's make sure that everyone listening is on the same page. I think all of us

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.430
agree

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.840
Selenium is a great tool and I think all of us agree

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.560
Several great tools will encourage really bad ways of using them

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.520
right

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:15.800
Metaphorically croissants are made with a stick of butter and that'll super spike your cholesterol. So you shouldn't actually eat croissants, but they're delicious

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.520
That's what I'm trying to say butter

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:28.120
Well if croissants were originally and by the way the title this episode is going to be the croissants are Selenium

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.400
But they're really but they're really bad for you should have you know

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.040
It's like saying the croissants are I mean the croissants came out of a place where they were for a certain type of people and

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.760
They've been adopted now everyone's eating the croissants and they're eating them wrong

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.890
We're eating them all the time maybe is the is the maybe they're eating him too much

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.850
Right you're supposed to eat croissants at the proper time and coming out of the environment you built it out of and we'll try

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.850
people are what

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.360
And our French listeners are going why these guys are so wrong

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.520
La la the croissants are a lie, okay

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.440
Right before lunch sorry, I guess our argument is that

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.480
We're highly aligned on that where Selenium came out of and I think

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.130
Developers that use Selenium use it very responsibly and well

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:31.130
Like if you're a developer and you end up best way for me to test this is through the is via the web page

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.530
I'm gonna go do this and you end up you would never settle as a developer for you

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:43.710
And yep, this selector looks fine. You would go add an ID for it and make the code look good the problem is is

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.990
Mentioned this before is that what's happened is

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.630
Selenium is being used as a way for

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.790
testers to learn to code to write code to

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:03.150
When working in a silent environment sometimes they end up being totally happy like this is this is the way you do it

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:08.830
You write selectors like this. I just right click and copy out of out of dev tools and I get this thing that looks like

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:14.330
gibberish, but that's how I write my automation and it ends up being super fragile and by

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.750
By that automation being fragile

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:24.050
They now have a job maintaining automation and now their entire job is maintaining automation and we think that's a really really bad thing

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:28.480
Right, let me let me add. Yeah, and that's where I think I agree totally agree

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:34.800
So Jason you said that the current the selector model that Alan's referring to

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.660
Wasn't a feature when when it was still in your control

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:46.720
Right. I mean if you go back to I think the very first I'm not sure if even CSS selectors were even a spec back in

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.860
2004 I know someone's gonna look that up and see when it came out

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:58.620
I wouldn't be surprised like 2007 2008 or something like that at the the moral equivalence or immoral equivalence of CSS selectors

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.380
Was XPath at the time that was the first thing that I think maybe one of the next things that came after that

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.560
So when I was using Selenium, that's what that's what I was doing and right and me

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.720
Batty right and I given your I

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:20.720
Could guess why yeah because it was XPath was like native code in Firefox and Safari and all that all the browsers accept internet

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.080
Explorer and so we had to emulate XPath

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.400
selector kinds of stuff

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:31.240
We had to use a JavaScript library in IE which meant like I think it increased the time of execution by like a hundred fold

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.240
or something ridiculous, right and

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.880
Anyway, so like that. Um, can I share a story? Yeah

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.400
Got it

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.920
So there's this one thing where Alan you were kind of pointing out of like, yeah

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.840
Just like well you should use IDs like the one thing I would I felt very triggered was like there's just one time

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.020
when I was at Google and I was talking with the Google Maps team and they were using XPath to get

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.640
To all of the they were actually they were testing Google Maps obviously

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.440
But there were all the map tiles, you know

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:02.120
Like go from one location location to the other and there's all these different kind of how do you test a global map?

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.720
Tool is a very specific case

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.460
But also there's some crazy corner cases, right and I just went in there as I usually do and say well

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.440
If the XPath stuff is working is not working don't use it put ID tags

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.560
Everywhere and just test that and they're like if we add an ID tag to every map tile at every elevation

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.520
We will increase the storage required for Google Maps by like, you know, five ten X or something

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.370
And that was already a pretty big number to start with right? So I realized oh, okay, that's bad advice

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.730
And so we could through process of kind of elimination. They realized they had to use XPath

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.970
There was no other because they couldn't instrument the code

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.670
So, you know, that was part of like one of my jobs when I was there of like to helping them figure out how to

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.970
Make things go go faster

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.570
No, it didn't cross anybody's mind

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.250
Like let's just not test it with so many of our dude

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.250
I knew browser testing there was a certain level of like, you know

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.330
It's given that we will do this browser testing their specific problem though

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.330
Is like because once they run it in IE the tests were taking forever

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.950
But they ended up having to get to the closest

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:02.090
Location before you jump into all the map tiles where you kind of get to like its parent

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.490
Elements like a div or something like that and then from there then you start navigating

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:11.770
Children and like go forward three steps to go to the left back up one and that's that was there the selector

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.250
And it was super annoying. I think the project years later

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:21.650
So anyway end of random anecdote with of Google Maps, but like it's a problem and sometimes you can't really do the right thing

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:28.410
I guess but we jumped to kind of recommending CSS selectors years later because for one under the hood

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.490
In whatever version of IE came out. It was also natively implemented

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.930
And so if you switch to that we didn't have to kind of shim in a JavaScript library to do that

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.370
So like people just naturally moved from XPath to CSS

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:48.130
But but again, either way either of those things are not ideal ideally you would go after some kind of unique tag to make it like super clear

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:55.060
Anyway, but it really came down to like the browser implementations and what was faster over time CSS selectors kind of became faster

00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:01.100
But yeah people when they when they start doing kind of like find the parent element go fight go down five children

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.640
It becomes very much like a you know

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.900
You're telling instructions to someone who's blindfolded like okay turn left go forward three paces turn right like that's yeah, that's ridiculous

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.320
Yeah, that won't that won't scale no the thing is is but if you but if you're on the Google Maps team

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.540
Then you might have to do that. No no no I mean for every rule

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.840
There's exceptions that are valid right and the thing I'm wondering right now

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:30.420
And we kind of did last episode under the assumption. It's dominant, but I think I'm wondering right now is the CSS style

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:38.250
The way everyone automates with with Selenium. No, it's not the way everyone is it's dominant. Oh

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:45.570
Actually, I would love to ask you this so so you were saying like tools can enable like gold or

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.850
I forgot to write it down

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.570
But basically like you can do an awesome thing or you can do kind of crap right right

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.470
But a different kind of tool can maybe add some safety rails there

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:58.730
So it actually kind of prevents the ability to do that bad thing right completely great

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:04.370
So in that context I'm curious like shit was it a mistake to put the CSS selectors in there

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.130
Or or it would it be an improvement?

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.410
I don't know how to phrase this question

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:12.210
But like if we have an opinion on the correct way to do it or the you know the incorrect way to do it

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.170
let's say CSX like yours should should CSS selectors as a

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.930
Way of finding elements should that be removed from the tool if it gets abused so much should that be removed?

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.380
It can't at this stage because I think whether it's dominant or not

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:32.900
There are I get we all agree that these siloed test teams these separate test teams are not a great way to make software

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:38.700
But I think that's where Selenium is being used a lot and these teams right sometimes the only way for them to

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:45.540
Sometimes they don't even have an option to communicate with the developers and right which is just sad that is very sad yes

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.980
Yeah, it breaks my heart. It's sad well though the one I'm more worried about is the one where

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.940
where there's a negative relationship between the tests and dev teams and

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.640
Dev is not adding the device IDs and we get feedback along those lines

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.410
and

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.370
Testable says okay. We'll screw you

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:13.750
I'll go with CSS or the style sheet approach and work around the fact that you're not helping us do the right and of course

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.850
It's a missed opportunity to ask the question like well should we even have tests at all right or at least at this level

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.850
right yes, oh yes, I

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.090
Was setting you up for like for you to totally I was setting up the straw man

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.970
You didn't take my bait

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:34.090
Well, no I was thinking about it earlier, so I'm gonna ask you this question

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.450
And actually this is really good because we can talk about the origins of Selenium again

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:43.130
And and these stories are all great you can just you just tell random stories about Selenium as much as you want

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.090
We'll fit them in but the question I want to ask is

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.930
Work with development teams using Selenium

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.540
my hypothesis and my experience

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.060
Anecdotally is that is that when dev teams own those Selenium tests

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:03.860
They're actually very good about writing only the tests they need versus trying to automate everything with Selenium

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:08.160
Which unfortunately these we see more often these silo test teams what they try and do

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:14.380
So how did what are some heuristics he used to figure out what you would test in Selenium, and what you wouldn't

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:20.940
What I would test with Selenium what I wouldn't I used to give a little talks about this and trying to mentally uh you know

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.780
Remind myself of all my little slide shows

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.940
Um the number one thing would be I think there's like failure modes right that some someone kind of gets super enthusiastic

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.940
And they just test anything that moves right so I've got lots of opinions on this

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:38.210
But I can also kind of go back to what we did originally look like why it existed

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:44.920
Jason why would we not test the things that don't move whoa yeah, okay, just broke my brain

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.880
I'm gonna ignore that question

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.400
So it started as a it really was for from a regression point of view the very specific thing

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.720
I call this like this the sine wave of quality where

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:03.640
The the reason why it was basically pencils down screw this we are gonna solve this problem and then Selenium came out of it was

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:10.480
This this dumb little button in Firefox is working and then it and then it someone did something to it forgot

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.760
But it was but they would break it in Internet Explorer and so that the bug

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.900
Report would be it's broken in IE fix it so they go and do that

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:22.600
They push it in we push it to production and to da of course they've now broken it in Firefox, right?

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.720
So the next week we support we put in a bug saying Firefox is broken

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:32.020
This will button in Firefox is broken fix it so they go in and fix it when they test in Firefox

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.900
We push it to production and what what happens? It's now broken in IE

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.180
So there was this like we were not making any progress and we were regressing, right?

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:46.220
and so I kind of I forced this as a kind of like a no retreat kind of like

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.020
sometimes there's a different metaphor like a ratchet like you're kind of moving up and up on like a

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.420
Roller coaster, right? It keeps it keeps you from back sledding right? No, I wanted to have

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.780
What was that it said sounds like you were on a merry-go-round

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.940
Or the caffeine is this finally kicking in? Yeah

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.820
the

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.980
It was just yeah, right. Oh, right the project felt whatever. It was a circle time is a flat circle, right?

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.260
it was very frustrating and so I

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:17.460
kind of went with this observation if you will not an opinion just observing the team collectively that

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:23.100
You tell them to fix it in Firefox to fix it in Firefox because they're good developers, but they're not covering every base

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.940
And so we said like let's automate this for one and then to like let

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.450
Let's solve it

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.530
So so over time over the first couple of months of Selenium kind of being on the project

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:39.130
We were finding little cases like that or we were we were kind of sort of backsliding like we fixed one thing

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.130
but we break something over there and so

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:45.130
Initially that basically the test names were kind of tracked to like whatever random

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.490
Regression bug ID that they were linked to right and I don't see this actually a lot in a lot of teams

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:51.610
They they kind of are more

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:57.430
Upfront right so here's a feature. Let's what's the automated test for that feature and and there you go

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:03.210
Right. So over time we eventually as new features were being created again because the Selenium project came

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:08.830
there were six months of development before we had any user interface tool, which of course is kind of potentially mind-blowing of like

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.210
Like maybe that was a good thing

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:16.170
I don't know like maybe maybe all projects should go six months and then do Selenium tests later if they

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:22.170
Like maybe they're like maybe that's the prognosis like don't do anything day one wait three months and then see if you need it

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:27.090
Right. I don't know. But the other thing eventually we added like new feature tests

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.810
but we got a lot of value I got personally as like the project manager of this thing like and

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:37.410
Whatever like I could finally see the team was not backsliding and so kind of a regression testing point of view

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:44.330
But also like in that context of like cross browser regression testing making sure that when you we were specifically doing something on one browser

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.890
We weren't inadvertently breaking something on the other side of the room, right?

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:52.010
And I kind of I get value on that but in that bigger context of what you're asking like right kind of

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.490
We there was a million other kinds of ways that we could do it

00:31:55.490 --> 00:32:00.570
But you know given that we had limited resources be kind of focused on those kinds of tests that we thought were the most useful

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:06.410
When I give kind of this little speech to other people I also kind of say like you're gonna write tests ahead of time

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:08.850
Or actually doesn't matter the context

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.250
But if you're gonna like to start from zero, what would you test and one would be like the money path?

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.250
I call it right the there's some path

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.770
One step one, but whatever you're doing. Hopefully it's making money if it's not

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:26.130
Solve that problem don't go write a bunch of Selenium tests if your startup is the more we automate the more we'll make

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.490
right and so like a

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:33.010
Find money somehow, you know either profit or grants or however you want to do it, right?

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.690
And then there is a money path, right? So maybe don't spend so much time

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.290
writing an entire framework around

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:46.450
You know changing the color settings or your header profile or but what but there is a play a path where people can swipe a

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.450
Credit card and give you money and sign up for the thing, right? So if you're gonna start somewhere

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.230
Focus on that and then you kind of build things around it. Sometimes there's this metaphor

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:58.050
It's not my metaphor, but very cliche like it's kind of like a paving the cow paths, right?

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:03.250
Where you kind of look where people are going and then that's where you figure out where to put the site the concrete for the sidewalks

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:11.130
I look at that, but it's also like following where where people what like what's the most valuable path through your application and start there

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:16.250
Eventually, maybe over time you you go to the the lesser used paths

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.210
But again, if it's kind of a focus developer team, maybe they don't get to it

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.850
So you touched on something I want you to set me straight on if needed

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.810
probably needed I

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.610
Haven't used Selenium in about three years

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:35.650
but the last project I used it on was a project using angular back at Microsoft and

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:43.550
We had and again kudos to Jim Evans for trying to make that ie webdriver work. I think he's done some great work

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.530
I'm not sure where that was at the time, but we had a really hard time

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:52.010
With our Selenium tests getting them to run across

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.530
Chrome ie Firefox and Safari, right? Yeah

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:01.610
That's unfortunate right because it was started to be that right? So it's like it's not living up to its

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:06.650
Resundetra if that was like in that moment like it needed to be across browser tool

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.250
Yeah, cuz that that's where we see

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:15.830
Like the story used to describe like if you want to make sure these elements continue to work right across browsers

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.490
Super powerful, but there is a parallel universe here

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:24.110
Like so there's from like a you know, correct way as you like if I'm meditating on that phrase of like they solve the wrong

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:29.950
problem really well, right one way that we could have solved that problem. Well in a completely different way is

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.190
John Resig created the jQuery

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.950
project right same

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:39.310
Goal was JavaScript is super buggy cross browser

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.550
And so it created one API that if you write to the jQuery API

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:50.910
Then you've solved your cross browser problems very elegant solution to the same problem completely different context, right? So like

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:56.570
There's a different kind of recommendation there right is not so much use jQuery, but there's a certain level like find ways

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.190
To avoid the cross browser testing problem without necessarily

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.270
Throwing all the weight at at the Selenium level or the testing level, right?

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:09.430
Maybe there's a different framework you can use her or just give up quit

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.290
Coca-liking across the country and give up all no, I mean

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.930
I'm actually thinking so

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.330
There's I see a move. I don't know if this is gonna take off

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:25.130
But I see a lot of browser companies basing on

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.750
on Chrome now and I and I wonder if essentially

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:36.020
That set sort of standardization is going to keep pushing forward

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:43.060
In to what degree that will eliminate cross, but I I sadly am like

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.700
I don't want to speak for you guys, but like

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:53.290
There's a certainly I guess I've I've now at risk of being that guy who's seen this the business cycles

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:58.030
And now I'm in the corner saying we've done this all before like like basically note one

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.180
No one listens to that guy

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.340
But the person that guy or girl is also totally right right like where everything is a fad

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:12.620
Everything's been done before there's a certain level of like so if nothing else like to your point like there's kind of browser consolidation

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.340
Everyone's kind of like choose like go getting on the bandwagon. It's all gonna be chrome

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.140
I would look at it saying like well inevitably

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.060
Google will become like Microsoft and

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:31.020
realize it has all the power the universe and go super evil and then naturally some Firefox like thing will come out of that and

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.940
You know punch the air like shake their fists kind of like it give a brave heart speech and say Google is evil

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.660
We're gonna do this other thing and they'll effectively you know

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.420
There'll be another 10 years 15 years of the Firefox

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:47.340
There'll be a new Firefox that will fight the old evil chrome like this is like inevitable, right?

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:53.540
so I'm not too worried about chrome like a kind of a monoculture around chrome because if it gets it if it gets too much of

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.360
a problem it will then

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.320
history will repeat itself and then there will be kind of a

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.720
blossoming of a bunch of options for right now we're kind of a consolidation mode and

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.360
That's just I don't know. I guess I just look at it

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.440
It's like I guess it's maybe a problem, but I'm not so fired up about it

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.800
But magically somehow it'll solve itself in 10 years. I guess is what I'm trying to say in hindsight

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:20.120
I'm wondering I have two thoughts in my head. I'll see if I can keep them straight, but one thing I'm wondering is

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.440
if those

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:27.360
Selenium tests we had were just I mean they were they were fairly simple, but maybe too complex

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.440
Maybe what you want to test there is for cross for cross browser compatibility

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:38.780
I'm wondering if there is some heuristic around writing simple tests and the simpler the test is or the less crazy you try and get

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:44.180
Maybe the more apt that test is to run success. Yeah, I mean, yeah

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.600
It sounds like I mean we could you know

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.640
Put my you know putting consulting hat on there like a load of dive down and specifically see the lines of code and see that

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.520
Like why is it working here and not there? Yeah, and to be generally yes

00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:01.520
And there's so much does I tried it and there's so much progress on all fronts on the webdriver projects that it's

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.020
No, thanks to me. Absolutely. No, like this is all

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.720
All thanks to Jim and Simon and yeah

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:13.040
There's a million other people that are like day to day in the trenches working on the project now the other thing other thought in

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.840
My head is because of the Braveheart quote now. I'm wondering if that's where the brave browser got their name from

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.330
I don't know

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.330
Which Braveheart quote? Oh

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:28.810
I was just I was just imagining my in my mind. I was just imagining a was it I'm blanking out his name, but uh

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:36.890
It's the actor Mel Gibson like just standing on his horse just encouraging people to go into battle and now I can't remember why I was it

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:37.890
anyway, but

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:45.040
Rallying cry. Yeah, right. Yeah, someone's gonna have some rally in Christ and we need to fight these browsers. Whatever. Where were we?

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.240
You're asking two old guys. You can't remember where they where they parked their cars

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:57.000
So the one thing that Jason started talking about we might I can just send so many people rolling their eyes listening to this right now

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.200
We expected a fight no

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.600
The I am the steel I am the top Google search for still caged in I fight by the way

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.600
I want to point that out you are why

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.760
Well, that's funny story

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:15.860
So it took everyone stop while you're doing Google the phrase steel cage and I fight and the story there was this was the Google

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.740
Test automate. I totally cut you off. I'm sorry. No, it's story time

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.960
This was the Google test automation conference 2007. So this is Google's second

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.960
Test conference and there's a whole awesome

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:32.400
Backstory on even why Google did this test conference for a couple years and some I've got some conspiracy theories in my they stopped doing it

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.760
But anyway, I'm not important to the story. So so I'm there in New York City

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.920
And I was drafted in to give a talk to replace the speaker at that time

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.760
I was a googler I've been there like for six months Simon Stewart was still at ThoughtWorks and I had just left

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.680
ThoughtWorks like the year before

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.680
He was there to present web driver

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.000
And I had seen web driver when we were both at ThoughtWorks a year earlier

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.060
And anyway, so I was ready to

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.180
kind of like not be impressed

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:08.180
By by his talk and and also there were a lot of Selenium talks at the at G tech and also I was like super

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.980
Awkward and weird about it right because I didn't realize it was being used that much

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.820
anyway, so I was sitting through Simon's talk and

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.940
I realized he had fixed like I'm kind of sitting there with crossed arms thinking like okay waiting to

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.520
Take notes and shoot everything down and he had fixed all of the problem every

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.880
Conceptual architectural whatever you want to call it idea that I was against web driver and how he did things he fixed all those problems

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:38.480
And it was awesome and brilliant and in an instant as I'm watching his his talk about web driver

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.440
I realized this is it. This is the this really is the Selenium killer

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.560
Like this is all this is all the things I would wish we could do in a future version of Selenium

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:51.480
So then I had kind of a choice there if like it could either be like my new best friend or I could find some weird passive-aggressive

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.040
Way to like super hate on him, right because like he's clearly made the better tech

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.360
So this was these were like our presentations, right? The other footnote to history

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:02.880
my talk was I I created an AWS account two days before and

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:09.320
Got access to like 20 machines in the cloud and I wondered if I could run a browser test in the cloud

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.480
I thought that'd be interesting and this is like 2007, right?

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.280
So that was actually AWS had only been around for maybe six months or a year at that point

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.120
So this was like a new thing in the world anyway, so I know to that thing

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.360
But the reason why still cajun I fight long story long

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.440
They were lightning talks at the very last day

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.560
And so I proposed kind of as a way to encourage this

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.620
He's either figuring out whether he's my new best friend or my new enemy

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:35.280
I proposed doing a dueling lightning talk where we would both

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.880
Talk about Selenium and webdriver as a kind of kind of set it up as a debate kind of it like in

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.480
Lincoln Douglas debate or something like that, whatever but with the caveat where I would have to argue

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.960
For and against webdriver and he would have to argue or something like for I would have to argue for

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.720
Like five reasons why his web driver is awesome. It's letting him is horrible

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.160
I that would be my side and then Simon would stand up there and give her five reasons

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.120
Why web driver is horrible and something was awesome, right? So we would like flip sides

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:08.440
Arguably, whatever anyway, so the thing was that that conversation and can't believe we went

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.640
You know, he went along with it. We did this thing, but there was like a lot of ha ha I'm serious

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.400
Kind of conversations of like well, what have we merged projects, right? What if we joined forces?

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.440
And so that it kind of started at that

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:27.820
You know GTAC 2007 New York City. That's where web the web driver like the idea of web driver joined this lightning project

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.040
Started and it started with kind of like yeah this very

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.040
Kind of joke of an idea of like let's do a steel cage knife by where of course it comes out that we're just all friends

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.200
No, I knew that was brilliant

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:45.040
Particularly, you know if you felt beforehand that web driver was the better product which is what I heard right? You're like

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.040
So I win well done

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.520
Well, there was a specific idea that he implemented that

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:58.220
That I kind of like well, that was the wrong idea. Um, there was something in the water like

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.560
With there's an older framework idea called fit framework for integrated testing Ward Cunningham more famous for creating

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.400
Right, right more famous for creating Wikipedia and though or sorry not Wikipedia, but the wiki

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.920
and

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.780
But then there was other projects that are out there where they're kind of running with this idea and even with the first version

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.100
Of Selenium also kind of ran with the idea for implementing fit

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:23.960
I'm I first might eat one and only maybe email the work Cunningham was like is anyone done fit for JavaScript if not great

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.040
I'm gonna go do that right so that that was like part of its tagline and I realized at some point later

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.880
Like wow, that was a that was a like a bad idea

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.560
To do that, especially if it's a developer tool

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:39.480
Like if you're writing a developer tool for developers, they would rather write in Python or Java or C sharp or whatever

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.480
They don't want to write in HTML tables or something like that, right? It's kind of ridiculous

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.520
But but there are other frameworks that are still out there

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.760
That still use that and when I when I first saw

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.940
Simon's first implementation of web driver. He was also you kind of doing that first kind of

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.900
User interface or facade into it was like a fit like we had to write your tests and tables and really ah, man

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.980
Here we go again

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.500
But when he gave that presentation in New York, he got rid of all of that

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.500
he just got to like the chocolaty goodness of

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.580
the stuff and the

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.220
Like just footnote to history

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:16.540
But the specific thing was Selenium one like at that time the state-of-the-art for slam everything was emulated in JavaScript again

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.820
Same way the surprise Cyprus is implemented now is all

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:25.600
Injected JavaScript in the browser and Simon solved it kind of at the operating system level where you would ask the operating system to

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.620
Click a button or something like that. So as far as the browser is

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.380
From the browser's perspective perspective the events were more native

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:37.900
And less flaky or something like that. Anyway, I'm getting super in the weeds here, but

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.500
Where were we?

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:46.540
One thing I wanted to mention and then I'll ask for some closing comments from you or quit everything we can get to I

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.340
Went to maybe the last I think it was the next to the last

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.220
GTAC conference. Yeah, and

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:59.140
Ironically, I'm I may actually be using that word correctly in this case or yeah

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:07.650
I nicknamed it the flaky test conference because every single talk had some flavor of talking about how to deal with flaky tests

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:13.630
Right and I think it's just interesting that came up in my head. Yeah while you were talking

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:19.090
I don't know why you need to I mean, it's one slide just says the word delete

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.070
Great what I what I find fascinating was like why Google

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:29.250
Started the that series of conferences. It was the first one was L tack

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.130
So it was the London test automation conference Alan Hutcheson

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.930
Based in New York or sorry in the London office there

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.460
And here's the thing about the whole GTAC conference secretly it was oh

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:47.260
What they were finding was that it's really hard to find people like developers who kind of are interested in testing

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.020
So this is a way of like flushing people out in the world of like to self-identify

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:56.020
As like people who are like just totally geek out on this stuff, right? It's really hard to find that that

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:59.350
developer

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:03.270
Test-minded developer if you will so it for a couple years. It was secretly

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.030
secretly

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:09.270
Very secretly on the lowdown kind of a recruiting effort for Google

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:12.850
Right at some point the cat was out of the bag and it became obviously a recruiting thing

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:15.950
So why would people then send their employees off to a Google?

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:20.710
Conference to then just be poached and then leave right so once once that was obvious

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:24.950
It was impossible who's gonna who's gonna go if you're not already a googler

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.710
Like why would you send your employees there, right?

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:32.430
But there was a good couple of there's some beautiful years there at the beginning where there really wasn't a developer

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:37.510
Really geeky really nerdy in the weeds like let's like just tons and tons of code

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.390
developer focused testing conference

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.630
the other kind of context here was like I didn't even know when we started Selenium that

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:48.150
Testing was a profession that there were books that there were conferences and all kinds of things like that

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:53.150
so kind of leading like informs and I would only go to developer conference like JS com for or

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:56.070
Pycon or things like that only after a couple years

00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:01.030
I finally like once you like testing conferences like star East Star West or

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:05.590
STP con things like that but but Alan was specifically trying to find developer

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:11.590
Test-minded developers if you will and he felt like there wasn't a lot of like real like in the weed

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:17.730
gnarly geekiness like so like to fix a flaky test. Yes, you get the leading in 2007. I completely agree with that

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:21.870
I think I don't was this in back in 2007 like 12 years ago

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.750
Yeah, I completely agree with that

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.430
right the separation of roles

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:34.350
Was was a big thing at a lot of companies Microsoft still had a same right for sure. They had

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:40.770
Almost 10,000 testers at that time. So finding test-minded developers matter of fact

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:47.170
I think 2007 is even sort of pre the dominance of TDD and and sort of

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:52.770
Design constructs that now are very popular in the industry

00:47:53.210 --> 00:48:00.050
So III don't think that world exists today. I wonder how often or to what degree I'm right

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.340
I'm thinking again putting myself in the the seat of the listener here

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:09.080
And I'm just thinking like listening to myself tell all these wonderful stories, which I thought was a good idea

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.640
Maybe it is. I don't know probably not but I'm thinking like, okay

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:17.360
Was there any actionable thing going forward like okay now we know what the industry was like a couple years ago

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.740
Like yeah now what so what okay go eat croissants. That's the moral

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.300
So actually yeah it so it's time for us to close but why don't you

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.220
Here's a suggestion Jason wanted to what's your

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:39.060
What's your do you have any regrets around how selenium is being used today?

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:45.500
Or do you have any guidance around how so again I mentioned I think I can make an argument

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:50.260
It's immoral or it's UI automation to some degree is immoral and

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:57.180
Yes, that's hyperbole, but I think all three of us know that that that that is

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.420
Non-trivially true when we look at it from a business context

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:08.620
Anything you want to mention on that regrets like is there one thing if you had an audience to tell testers?

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:14.060
Hey, please stop doing this with my baby. What would you want to say? Oh?

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.100
Man, and that's gonna be anything. It doesn't have to be

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:24.620
Even related to what we talked about today. I guess I would just say web testing is just so yesterday

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.620
It's all about robots right now

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.920
Really I you know I've got I've got a lot to say on that stuff

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.820
I mean, I don't know how to put a bow on that. There's a certain level of like

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:42.480
I'm that dangerous engineer who you know that whole like you know they spend so much time figuring out how they can do it

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:49.480
They don't spend enough time deciding we're figuring out you're spending enough time thinking about whether they should right I put myself in this role

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.710
where it's like

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:56.270
Where I look I get motivated when someone tells me something is impossible

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:01.810
Selenium came from a time where people said it is impossible to test JavaScript right?

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:06.570
I rejected that and so Selenium came from like the massive motivation was like tada here

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:11.750
It is here is a tool that can you can use to test JavaScript right? I wanted to win that argument

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:18.070
It's a completely different argument, but it needs to happen on whether you should I want to kind of take off the table

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.990
You shouldn't do it because you can't do it. I feel like that is

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:25.830
Not a great argument it can it can shut down conversations for sure

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:31.990
But I don't like that I would like I would rather encourage people to say assuming we can do it and assuming we can totally

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:33.590
Do it well we can solve that problem really well

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:40.070
You know should we be solving that problem right and you just like fine like and this is where we totally agree like find that higher level

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:46.990
Above the browsers like should we be writing a web app should it be a mobile app should we be making an app at all?

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.510
right

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:53.870
Like try to find that and maybe some of these decisions kind of come out of it. So you mentioned robots

00:50:54.550 --> 00:51:00.310
One of one of our listeners asked the question on select the other day and one of the opinion. Hey

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:05.670
Specifically do we think AI is gonna kill Selenium?

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.420
Hmm now I

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.780
essentially said a very long worded version of

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.340
Not any time soon right, but what's your thoughts?

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.120
So this is interesting

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:25.560
No, I don't think it will because it's like an overhyped word that like means everything and nothing right now

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.840
So like there's no way anything could possibly live up to this hype right unless by killing Selenium

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.120
It kills, you know half the planet and therefore

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:40.680
Some kind of like doomsday terminator scenario or like well. Yeah, technically as an afterthought afterthought, right it after effect whatever

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.560
So a couple years ago

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:49.000
I I had this idea and I guess I didn't think to put AI in the word of it because it wasn't this buzzword thing

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.320
But I thought like you know

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:56.520
What definitely needs to stop happening is people spending their whole day staring at a at the Selenium API and trying to figure out?

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.920
How to craft the perfect test and I thought it would be more useful use of time

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:07.880
To maybe look at Google Google Analytics political data see where like basically that's that cow paths metaphor

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:14.680
Find where people are going which kind of means like put stuff out in production and see how people are using it and then

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.360
Use that to inform how you should test but then take it one step further

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.320
If it now like if there's like this path that's emerging because you've kind of instrumented things

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.960
Why don't you just have that spit out the Selenium test suite for you, right?

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:33.840
It's effectively converting a log file to a Selenium test and then taking it one step further like not even like doing anything with like you

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.200
Could stop there and say okay download your Selenium test suite and install it into your CI

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:45.160
But how about you go one step further beyond that and it automatically runs basically today's production code against

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.800
like the the mod of the your newest version that's in

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.360
Source control, but you haven't pushed to production yet

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.040
Right and so you then you start doing kind of like a an A B test if you will of like, okay

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:05.280
You know production we had roughly this number of paths to sign up for credit cards and whatever run all effectively this log data against

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:12.600
our production candidate and as long as things aren't grossly out of bounds then that's like it vaguely seems like we we've

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.480
tested things like we haven't broken anything and

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.440
push that to production and it basically get to a point where no one opened an IDE and

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:28.060
Look at the Selenium or the web driver API and wrote a test like the system wrote those tests there is

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:34.840
There is a patent out there. It's called. I thought I was rather clever analytics driven development. So I patented ADD

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.200
And it's this idea that you would take you take this analytical data and

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:45.640
You would generate test cases and then use those automatically to test your stuff that's out there

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:50.320
And I would argue that well, that's like a machine learning algorithm that that is AI

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.140
And and so does that kill Selenium? No like under the hood you would still have some

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.360
Automation engine that would run steps that automate a browser

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.000
So that doesn't go away and if anything else because humans screwing it up does

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.360
Yeah, maybe but you're gonna screw things up in awesome new ways

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.600
So it ends up being like like all like all technology

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:19.400
it will now be like pushed down into a lower level of the stack that we're like barely aware of and

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.080
You know, there's these metaphors about like, you know leaky abstractions or something. It'll be something like we're

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.520
Almost like compiling to assembly. It's it's there someone super wants to geek out

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.120
They might have to pop the hood and go down there

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.080
But people will be spending all their time kind of manipulating

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.440
machine learning kind of data sets of like

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:40.280
Oh, how do we replicate production data before we before we push to production like oh, well, let me find

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.040
There'll be all these arguments about how do we basically coach?

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.120
Her again from a cow paths metaphor. How can we maybe?

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:53.500
Heard these virtual animals whatever you want to call it. How can we modify?

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:59.380
How do we create these data sets? How do we encourage this AI that is like almost like an?

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.300
Not so much an artificial intelligence that can go back in time and kill us

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.060
But maybe like it's like a puppy or or some sheep

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.460
Like how do we modify these AI things into kind of testing their software the way we want them to?

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:17.580
But under the hood the engine that it will be doing to do its thing will be on a more webdriver, right?

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.620
But will people be writing Selenium tests?

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:25.380
Like I'm not convinced that people will be but they'll need to be able to read them because if the AI spits out

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:30.900
Total garbage someone will have to go in there and fix it just like today someone somewhere has to go into

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:37.700
Source code and modify cobalt because like the IRS or say social security like couldn't print checks last week

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:44.220
Like that code's still there, but most the time you don't care about it. It'll it'll hopefully just work. So maybe

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:51.540
Maybe Selenium future is that it's like it's it's like cobalt. It's everywhere, but you don't care until you don't get paid

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:57.300
So I'm gonna tweet that right now inventor of Selenium says it's just like cobalt

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.460
All right

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:05.100
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah these this been awesome having you on I love the stories

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:09.580
I think we're it's good to hear that it's good for you not to yell at us and and

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:15.840
Find some agreements there and and point out our hyperbole. We appreciate that but yeah

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.240
Fantastic, thank you so much for volunteering to be on our show. Thanks

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.060
All right. I'm still Alan and I'm Brent. Oh, I'm Jason Huggins

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.880
Thanks, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye
