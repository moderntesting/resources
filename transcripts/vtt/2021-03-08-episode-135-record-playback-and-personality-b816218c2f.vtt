00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.820
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.820
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.620
Now on with the show.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.780
Welcome to the AB testing podcast.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.500
I'm Alan and I'm not wearing a shirt.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.980
Uh, he is Alan and he's lying.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.620
All right.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.020
It's for, it's for you to use your imagination.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.460
We're back for episode one 35 of the AB testing podcast.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.900
This is still season one.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.700
Some podcasts have seasons and we have one also.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.340
It's just all season one because our topics, if we had seasons, have you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.020
listened to podcasts that have seasons?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.140
Yeah.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.100
A season kind of needs a theme.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.820
A theme would require planning an organization, neither of which

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.460
we do here at AB testing.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.420
We are adaptive.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.340
We talk about whatever's important at the time we're recording, because

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.860
it's the thing we can think of to talk about.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.220
That's correct.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.660
Although if, you know, if there's a high demand for seasons, I would

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.620
propose we could just, uh, advance it based on years.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.660
Yeah.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.700
Except whoever proposes it, it's going to have to go back and, and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.660
renumber our prior season.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.900
Yeah.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.460
That it's that seems like work.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.420
Work.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.100
Yeah.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.020
That involves work.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.340
Uh, and we're not in, well, I mean, we do a lot

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.060
of work, right?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.980
But I want the podcast to be something that's interesting for people to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.140
listen to.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.420
So we should talk about things that we think are interesting to us.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.620
That sounds very selfish when I put it that way, but hopefully we talk

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.700
about things that are relevant.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.860
And again, if we go back for, if you're listening to your first AB testing,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.300
or maybe your second, we are not defining anything new.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.580
We are not predicting what's going to happen.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.620
We are not prescribing something we think is where we think people should go.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.100
We're talking about what we're already seeing, what we're seeing being successful.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.220
So if you see change coming, uh, in fact, if I go to Reddit in the testing or

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.380
quality assurance subreddit once a week, someone is talking about what's

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.380
happening, changing and testing our team.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.260
Our team is getting rid of our testers and everyone's a developer.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.820
What does it mean?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.780
We're here to help you figure out what that means and how to help you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.100
get your team to not screw that up because we've gone through it.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.100
And you and I have both seen very closely team screw that up.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.700
So where was I going with that?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.220
I don't know anything else where I talk about me some more.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.020
No, I would, I would even further say we've seen teams screw it up.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.300
But here's actually, here's something I'm curious from your point of view.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.650
We, we, we both are saying that there should be, when you're doing this,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.810
uh, I think we both agree that the benefits far outweigh the, the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.570
detriments number one, uh, people should move forward, but do so plan fully.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.770
I don't know, but you know, don't plan like a 1998 big design up front

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.930
waterfall thing, like you'll make mistakes, but adapt.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.650
I've talked about the way we plan projects in my org at unity before

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.490
at this 50% probability of a date.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.410
We do that not because to be different, we do it because it's a sweet spot

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.050
between over-planning and under-planning.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.450
And what's happened in our culture is this idea of a P 50 comes up for.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.030
Other types of changes as well, not just delivery of code.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.350
What's your P 50 plan to do X?

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.830
So yeah, it's a, you should have a sweet spot between over-planning

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.470
like we did in the old days, just enough design up front to aim

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.150
yourself in the right direction and then be ready to learn and adapt.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.750
Yeah.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.390
But in addition to it, it's like, don't let the fear of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.230
screwing up the role out.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.470
Abt again.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.990
Yeah, you should be okay.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.830
Just screw stuff up.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:02.870
So speaking of learning segue, I gave in between the last podcast and this one,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.430
I delivered a webinar.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.390
Thank you to test project for hosting it.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.950
Talking about this again, we've talked about now for three podcasts.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.190
So we'll go too deep, but this myth that there is a huge mindset change between

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.000
developing and testing, and I really just talked about some things talked about

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
before, went into more details on some things I wrote in an article about six

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.940
weeks ago now, and I was ready to be skewered, but I wasn't.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.170
I was pleasantly surprised.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.770
The questions were more like we'd address on the podcast.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.210
Like, how do I handle this change?

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.610
How do I, how should I go about this change?

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.650
What do I do when developers don't want to test?

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.090
No sorts of things that I'd expect the sort of facts for if developers do testing, how

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.370
can they do it as well as I do?

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.810
I'm a specialist, blah, blah, blah.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.690
Nobody told me I was full of crap.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.650
Although the video recording is up on YouTube and you can find it in my Twitter

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.530
stream so far, only one downvote.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.210
Brent, I have to ask, why did you downvote me?

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.130
Uh, I just didn't like how you were looking on there.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.770
You weren't dapper enough.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.370
No, I look like crap.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.290
You weren't representing the brand.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.210
Brent started the podcast leading way back saying I am staying away from my keyboard.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.010
Yeah.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.370
Now, now he's bringing up my YouTube video so we can see if he can download it again

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.410
under a different account.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.020
I want to see what the additional, uh, comments might've been.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.940
I don't think anyone's commented on the YouTube video.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.020
I haven't looked at it in a while, but I could tell you, yeah, the one downvote,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.740
but I only have 12 up votes.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.140
So it's not, and comments are turned off.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.460
So nobody, nobody said anything.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.380
So that's what we know so far.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.100
All right.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.020
Anyway, check it out.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.300
If you didn't see the webinar, I don't think it's anything surprising to anyone

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.740
on here, but, uh, that was a fun one to put together.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.980
I feel pretty good about the talk.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.620
Uh, of course I'd love feedback.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.500
You can go to our slack group at one of the three dot slack.com and get an

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.100
invitation from our, our website at modern testing.org, pluggity, plug, plug,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.540
plug.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.980
So yeah, that happened.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.180
And, and when I'm really bored, I'm going to go back and look at this video of

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.580
yours from seven years ago about starting out in security testing.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.900
Oh yeah.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.180
Yeah.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.740
I have a couple of things that was me interviewing Alan Mervold.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.140
So we're talking about, there was a time when I was in engineering excellence.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.780
I can't believe that was only seven years ago.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.660
It feels like a freaking lifetime and a half ago then, or maybe actually

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.980
it was recorded before then.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.500
I just uploaded it then.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.180
But the idea was we had realized how much of how much learning happened in

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.300
the old days when we'd be at, I have offices and we go to work.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.540
You just go into someone's office and ask him a question and get

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.100
15 minutes of gold knowledge.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.900
So what we did for a little while was these are highly staged, but we'd,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.380
I only posted a couple of them to YouTube, but we had a dozen or so of these

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.340
conceptual whiteboard videos where the idea was you'd see me knock on someone's

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.220
door and then come in and ask a question and they'd explain it to me on

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.820
the whiteboard, I'd ask questions.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.220
That part wasn't staged.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.580
We just kind of staged me walking in with the camera running, but then we

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.020
just recorded them explaining something to me and we put it on, we used them

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.130
internally, put it on the internet to try and capture that, to try and spread

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.010
that method of learning a little, little wider.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.810
It's a good idea.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.050
It was fun at the time.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.010
So where was I going?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.890
I don't know.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.130
Webinar was good.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.090
Appreciate your feedback.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:39.580
Why do you, why do you think it ended up being so different than what

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.540
you expected?

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.220
Do you think, I think I made my point.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.220
Well, also probably some, the people that probably hated what I wrote and hated

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.520
the concept probably didn't tune in or I don't know, I don't know.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.750
I did expect a little bit more, but Alan, you whatever, but that wasn't there.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.190
I think people got where I was coming from.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.390
I gave, I thought I supported my case pretty well.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:12.340
So I think the thing most people struggle with is not that I felt like in that room,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.000
people felt like, okay, developers can do good testing.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.240
They're still stuck in the, but my developers don't want to do testing or my

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.800
developers shouldn't have to do testing.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.600
Any one of those flavors, which have different solutions than the mindset thing.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.000
I'd like to think I did a fairly good job convincing people that if a developer

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.720
is given the responsibility of testing, they can do quite well.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:36.760
Yeah.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.000
It's it's, those are sort of the top three excuses, right?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.120
It's a number one developers can't do it.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.680
All right.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.680
Well, no, that's false.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.000
Number two, they don't want to do it.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.720
What's your first pushback on that one?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.400
And they don't want to do it.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.200
Mm-hmm.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.640
Uh, often, often that's not really it.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.200
They think they don't want to do it.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.760
I it's pairing is almost my answer for all of those questions.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.280
I think sometimes they're not wanting to do it is a fear of not knowing how to do

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.680
it or a fear of seeing value in them doing it.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.400
I've found the solution to all that stuff is to begin pairing with them, test

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.800
things together and they'll figure out, Oh, I can do this on my own.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.480
And they understand the value of it in that all of what we do and accelerate

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.280
the achievement, simple quality.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.040
We want to tighten up feedback loop.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:36.080
So that feedback loop involves a pass off, uh, that may involve time zones.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.360
Even that's inefficient.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.840
Yeah, for me, I would say, well, of course they don't want to do it.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.480
Right.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.240
We're, we're essentially proposing to take away their safety net.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.000
It's scary.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.520
For sure.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.160
And I think, I think they're just scared, but we have beat this horse to hell.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.080
I want to talk about my next rant and, and get some feedback.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.800
I am using test project as a platform.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.400
They've asked me to write some blogs for them and I haven't written blogs in a while.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.680
And if you remember, I wanted to get back into writing some more blogs to go back

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680
to our prediction episode.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.320
And here I go.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.760
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.680
But what I'm writing about and what they don't mind me doing is things that

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.320
pissed me off.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.040
So first I talked about this mindset thing, which I think is crap that a few

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.590
people have a few, uh, large, I want to say large egos, large influences in the

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.870
test world talk about this deep into this mindset change, which I think I've

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.630
proven as crap.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.070
The next thing I wrote about was challenging the notion that test automation

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.390
is done by a separate team from the team developing.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.590
I think developers should write the vast majority of test automation.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.190
I think that would actually improve design.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.590
I made the points in the article.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.510
I feel pretty strongly about that.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.710
And I'm thinking about what else pisses me off.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.630
It's like so many things make me mad, but I thought, well, maybe I'll write

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.590
something on exploratory test automation, but I've kind of done that before.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.430
And I could give some examples.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.910
It could be a more techie article and put some code samples in it, how I've used

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.670
tools to help me test, but then something hit me and I want to run it by you.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.870
So you've been in testing a test automation for a long time.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.150
What do you think of when I mentioned record and playback automation?

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.190
Like what's your, what's your first reaction?

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.380
Good tool when used for it's for what it's good for.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.180
How's that for it?

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.020
Says how would you, well, that's, that's crappy.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.260
So let me go ahead and answer that question myself because your answer sucks.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.860
You get an F minus record and playback tools.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.620
I used to hate, they were flaky as hell.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.620
They weren't maintainable, but I was in a different mindset back then of

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.140
automate all the things or many of the things, at least all the

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.300
things that should be automated.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:48.200
But if we look at what we agree about, I think the test automation pyramid

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.360
is a reflection of what happens when you have well-designed code.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.360
You have very few of these end to end tests and a few of those

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.120
tests are UI automation tests.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.720
Uh, we used to avoid record and playback tools because there were, the code

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.880
they generated was flaky.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.480
We didn't want to deal with all the crap and they were marketed at not a developers.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.360
They were marketed at testers who did not know how to code, who are not the

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.400
best people to be choosing what needs to be automated in my opinion.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.960
Now, if we were to market those record and playback tools to developers, one,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.360
they would use very few of them.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.000
It would be faster than writing anything in selenium.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.840
I have a bunch of people gonna be mad at me.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.880
Yes.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.240
Selenium is a good framework.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.120
It's not an efficient way to write you animation.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.440
I prefer test cafe.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.560
A lot of people use cypress.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.080
A lot of people don't like them for reasons A, B and C.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.680
I'm kind of thinking here's the, here's the hill.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.640
I'm thinking of climbing.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.440
I think given that the good record and playback tools from test

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:53.720
to Mabel, Autify and others have eliminated the vast majority of the flakiness

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.320
from your web automation tests.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.120
And I, I assume for UI automation with Appium, there are some similar things,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.770
but if that flakiness is gone and we only want to have a few of those tests,

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.930
why invest a lot of time relative amount, a lot of time of writing tests

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.650
with selenium when you could just record and playback those suckers and

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.810
have them stay fairly reliable for a long time problem is they're marketing

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.130
these things towards testers and not developers, but I kind of think the

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.290
time is ripe for record and playback to be the default way to do web automation.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.440
So I don't, I don't have any current experience on recording and playback,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.400
but I think the standard by which I would, I would hold that is essentially

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.640
it's going to be a combination of, uh, that, well, everything I do is by ROI.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.080
Okay.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.010
But the problem with the record and playback stuff is if they're

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.010
intended to persist the traditional record and playback, the problem with that

00:13:55.010 --> 00:14:02.670
is they're cheap to get out, but you spend, I don't know, a significant more

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.430
time on the backend of the price tag of this one, like maintenance

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.710
costs is through the roof.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.190
That's the problem with, with record and playback.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:19.640
Now, if you have a, if you have a measuring it by the total price tag,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.480
including the maintenance cost over, over the expected lifetime of the automation,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:33.360
if that's been improved, uh, yeah, why not there, there, they're cheap to, to grind out.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.840
And if the current record and playback systems have gotten to the point where

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:44.080
they can write maintainable code, like, Hey, we noticed you do this same

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.160
routine over and over again, we've.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.400
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.200
I mean, it used to be like that.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.480
Oh, well, the burden playback sucks.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.880
We can't reuse code chunks.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.240
I don't, I kind of don't care if the code underneath is spaghetti that I can't read

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.120
and I can't, I can't do anything with manually.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.560
I don't even care if I can see it.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.720
If I just need something that I can rely on to, to continue to let me know that

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.640
some scenarios functionality is correct.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:19.520
And it withstands changes underneath, which is what all these, these higher

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.280
end tools do, I kind of don't care about the code underneath.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.200
It doesn't matter to me.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:30.720
How does, how, how does current record and playback tools implement the Oracle?

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.480
How do you define pass and fail and current playback?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.080
Well, it's up to the human to define the Oracle and what, what

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.440
you want from a scenario.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.800
For example, you may want to see a, you have an account creation scenario.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.960
It would be a good one.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.280
You probably want to test end to end and not just at the integration level.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.480
Cause that's, that's critical part of your onboarding of customers.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.400
That may be you get, there's two things you do.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.160
One is at the UI level.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.120
You make sure that you get to the signup successful page.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.770
That would be the Oracle is this page exists by test past, but you also want to

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.090
have a parallel test I would kick off that would verify that the back end matches.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.770
Yeah.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.410
So I got to tell you often in the web automation world, people may only web

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.610
verify the front end, like, Oh, the, we got the right page that past.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.370
You need to apply a little bit of systems thinking to that, but that's the Oracle.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.730
You decide what the outcome is.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.930
You want what is the outcome of what you want to do from your test.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.930
So where are these tools help over traditional automation in the, in

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:37.770
selenium, I would find the web element for, for, to create a login or an

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.770
account on the site, and then one by one, I'd find the elements, wait for them to

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:46.170
appear, add my data to those, press the button, and then verify.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.210
I got to again, through web elements, something like the thing I got to, I

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.410
changed the ID of one of those things.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.370
Generally my test breaks.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.130
So what happens is, especially this is where this is going back a step to

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.730
developers owning the test automation.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.810
What happens now is the developers change some IDs, move some things around.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:10.330
All of the test engineers, remember on a different team, their stuff all breaks and

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.370
they have to go figure out why and change their test.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.250
That is a, that's an inefficiency.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:19.290
Now what these tools do, audifies my favorite by no lot of people use Mabel or,

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.730
or what's the other one I mentioned?

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.210
Test him.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.170
I think there are probably 20 others by now.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:23.930
It's a hot market.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.290
What they do is they figure out enough other information about the control that

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.530
you can change all kinds of crap about it, and they will still figure out what

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:37.850
control you intended and often let you know, like give you a maintenance step.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:38.170
Okay.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.850
This is, is this the same thing we'll update your, we'll

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.090
update our underlying structure.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.250
So they make it harder.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.890
They make it harder to screw stuff up by inferring and whether you want to call it

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.850
AI or ML or just being smart.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:55.090
I think on a side tangent, a lot of the stuff we did as smart monkeys 15 years

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.050
ago, that people are now calling AI and ML.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.490
So it's a fine line.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:04.570
But what these tools do is they allow the underlying code to change and for the

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:10.610
tests to still run and, and in most cases help you update those to help them stay

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.050
stay relevant or stay accurate in the future.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:19.490
So in the face of, of number one, these record and play tools, if the initial

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:25.330
technology is such that, uh, that initially the maintenance costs of it,

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.450
cause as you and I know, like it, that's the, that's the Achilles heel of record

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:35.930
plate is made it, if they've made it such that the maintenance cost is extremely

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.850
low now and then even furthermore, creation cost is low.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.770
So I can have a scenario.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.970
It may take me four hours to automate and selenium plus ongoing maintenance

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.050
costs to keep it going.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.770
If I can automate that workflow with a record and playback tool in 10 minutes

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:56.010
and have that test continue to run for weeks or months or years, why would I

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.930
invest in creating a bunch of tests in selenium and again, it could get on

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.170
weirdly if you add hundreds and hundreds of these, but that's the wrong

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.090
thing to do as well.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.930
Uh, yeah.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.690
And I agree the, the, at least again, I don't have any recent

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.410
practical knowledge on this front, but, but based on how you lay out, I don't

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.650
see the flaw, like in addition, you call out that where a maintenance cost

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:24.490
is incurred, these tools are now smarter and telling you and asking, uh,

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.530
essentially the way you phrase it is saying, Hey, is it okay?

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.570
Is it okay for us to make this change?

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.970
Like we're uncertain.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.690
Well, what do you plan with?

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.620
Uh, what is, what is in your hand?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.000
This is my child, Brent.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.840
So here's my statement.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.760
So all that said, give me feedback if you think that's crap, but I kind of

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.160
think there's something there.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:59.520
I think as far as all the vendors out there marketing tools to testers, if

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.560
you want to win, if you want to be like, there's a bunch of competition.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.640
If you want to get the most customers and, and get more market share, start

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.360
marketing your stuff to developers.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.240
They're going to know how to use your stuff most effectively.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.480
Testors are not your long-term audience.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.120
Yeah.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.520
I completely agree.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.680
Uh, the, and in addition to that, I'm wondering, like in this

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.840
particular topic, like knowing you as I do, right.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.320
You're, I don't know, a half an insight away from just going all in and

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.360
just saying test automation is dumb.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.680
You should record them playback.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:41.120
I'm wondering if you shouldn't, uh, set up a special AB episode on that front.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.480
Uh, with one of the listeners I'm here, I'm specifically thinking, uh,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.520
Percy to, to go through that thought process.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.280
I like, there it is an open invitation to anyone of the three, especially

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:01.080
if your name is Percy for a, uh, that would be Friday afternoon at six P

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.280
at Friday evening at 6 PM your time on a Friday of your choice, as long as

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.640
it aligns with our two week schedule.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.720
There it is.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.000
Let us know.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.440
I'm looking at Slack.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.120
Oh, we haven't posted this yet.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.640
So we don't know yet, but there it is.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.680
And YouTube.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.040
We're not live streaming.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.880
We're not live streaming.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.840
We're live streaming.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.760
Did I press record?

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.040
At least we're recording.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.680
Well, that is a step in the right direction.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.400
Okay, cool.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.060
I want to move on to another topic and I think this is one that's going to

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:33.680
involve both some discussion today and maybe some homework for next time.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.560
Oh, uh, and I'll see what you think.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.880
And I, cause I want to get one, some homework for us to do.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.600
And then another one ideas from our listeners on what we should do.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.540
So the topic is, it's not just personality tests, but I was

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.260
reflected talking to my daughter last night and she was sharing a bunch of

00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:00.100
different, uh, different personality or characteristics tests she's done.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.540
And she's done MBTI.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:07.100
She's also done the test that says which, uh, Hogwarts house you would live in.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.140
Uh, some other ones as well.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.780
Another one called any agreement here.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:12.980
Yeah.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.180
Like which Marvel hero would you be?

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.340
Those are a little out there, but I want to talk about the ones I've done.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.820
Cause we share a couple of these together.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.380
We both done MBTI.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.300
Yep.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.620
Myers-Briggs type indicator.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.260
That one is, it does give some good insights about yourself.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.700
What I found most valuable in that one is understanding.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.780
Cause again, it doesn't tell you how you act.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.860
It tells you what's difficult and what gives you energy.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.580
Uh, but there's some, there's some valuable information there.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.860
We have both done a thing was very popular at Microsoft.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.740
Not sure if it's still there anymore called insights.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.700
Is that still being used there?

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.460
Uh, not to my knowledge.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.340
Remember insights.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.420
I need to look it up.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.460
I have my book full of evaluations there.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.820
You get a color and I think I'm blue, red.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.900
I can't quite remember.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.700
I'm definitely not green, which means nothing to anybody who hasn't taken it.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.380
Yeah.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.900
And, and actually I am red, blue and they're nearly equivalent.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.260
I am like 0.05.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.140
I should look and I believe I may have changed.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.460
I think that one may change over time.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:11.900
I'm not sure.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.100
My roles are changed a lot.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.100
So, so actually I've done this research.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:24.480
I will tell you upfront, uh, the, the color one uses is no different than MBTI.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.440
So it doesn't change.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.400
It's who you are.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.120
Well, it does change because the, the, the problem.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.600
Carl Jung would say that with your MBTI, which, which it's based on his work.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.600
You don't change.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.440
It's your preferences.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.960
They're innate.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.880
They do not change.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.040
Well, right.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.720
Carl's Jung's work would say that MB, MBTI is.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.000
Actually a far cry from Carl Jung's work.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:46.440
Okay.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.040
It's agreed.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.240
Although it's based on that, it's based on that knowledge.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.440
So there has to be, there has to be something to that statement.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.960
But what I'm, what I was trying to close on is MBTI and insights has a direct

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.680
relationship and, and the insight stuff is actually just using two letters from.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:07.920
MBTI.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:08.680
Okay.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.200
And it's I versus E or T versus F.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:18.640
And so if you are an extroverted feeler, you're a yellow, if you are a,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:19.440
yep.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.800
And basically,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.000
which is don't we have the same MBTI type?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:23.920
We do.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.840
That's why I'm, I'm like a little more, little more, which is weird

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.560
that I am a blue, red, and you're a red, blue, because you're the

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.160
one in the analytics role.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.580
Uh, yeah.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.660
But if you look at mine, they're really close to exactly the same.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.060
Like there are times I just simply describe myself as purple.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:42.820
Okay.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.700
I want to, uh, I will get mine out before next time.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.860
I want to dive a little bit deeper.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.220
We've also both done strength finders, which I think is a really good one as well.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.060
Yes.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.740
And so I want to talk again a little bit about those.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.180
And the reason is, is I mentioned this in a five for Friday.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.340
I think a few of the three have done it, but there's a new one from Pat Lanchoni,

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.180
who's the author of five dysfunctions of a team and a bunch of other books

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.140
of which I have read every single one of them, probably at least twice each for now.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.580
All of them.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.180
I'm a huge fan of his work and his podcast.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.700
And he has a new one.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.260
He calls working genius.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.200
And I'm not going to do a full advertisement for Pat Lanchoni and his working genius,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.080
but he says there's six types of six types of sort of leadership genius

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.200
you bring to the table.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.360
Maybe I'll bring mine up.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.040
Maybe I will talk about them a little bit.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.120
If you haven't done the test, he should not even give you a code

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.880
for one if you want it, you don't, you didn't have to pay for it.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.320
Okay.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.720
So he says there's the genius of wonder, which is the natural gift of pondering

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.640
the possibility of greater potential and opportunity given situation.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.640
The genius of invention, natural gift of creating original and novel ideas

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.200
and solutions, genius of discernment, natural gift of intuitively and

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.280
instinctively evaluating ideas and situations, galvanizing, which is

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.920
rallying, inspiring and organizing, enablement, which is providing

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.160
encouragement and assistance for an idea or project and tenacity, which

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.800
is pushing projects or tasks to completion or achieve results.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.080
I have, I'm curious for your opinions on this.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.120
I'll give you more time to look at it before the next podcast.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.520
Cause sometimes I like it.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.360
Cause the idea is that there's probably two of these that you love doing

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.760
two that you know how to do and two that you suck at.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.400
You need to work with people that can do that to help you get stuff done.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.120
But I look at those and I've had to do, well, I suppose it's fair to say

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.520
I've had to do all of those.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.680
So maybe the question is to look at which ones the evaluation I did

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.480
says that I don't like doing cause they, they didn't realize it didn't

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.200
like doing them. And there is something to that as well.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.400
And from mine, I won't go deeply into these.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.240
I won't go into everything, but I am best at discernment and galvanizing.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.040
So I am good and enjoy using intuition and instincts to evaluate and

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.520
assess ideas or plans.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:58.120
That's the N in INTP and I'm galvanizing, which is I get people to do

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.920
shit together, you're good at and enjoy rallying people and inspiring

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.240
them to take action around a project task or idea.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.160
And what's funny with that is my inspiration for wanting to do that and to

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.560
get people to rally around that idea, which may lead into another topic

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.080
here in a minute.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.720
So let's put a little pin there is that I read one of his books.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.720
I forget which one it was called now, but this idea that when companies

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.320
are in trouble, like when Microsoft had their security issues back in

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.080
the early two thousands, the company rallied around improving in security.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.000
There was a rallying cry.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.960
People were excited about it.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.760
They were invested in it.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.440
They wanted to get better, learn a bunch of stuff.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.480
And they built this culture of security.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.560
Well, the concept of this book was you want to build that rallying cry

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.720
before there's a crisis.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.520
You want to have something you align on and the organization wants to do

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.080
before there's a problem that they're trying to solve.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.200
And so that was very inspiring to me.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.720
So that's kind of the way I've approached a lot of my leadership since then.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.680
So there could be a weird bias in the reason that one's such

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.440
an important for me, but I do enjoy that.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.840
I love seeing organizations come together or people across an organization

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.600
come together to solve a common problem.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.800
And I'm going to give you an example about that in a little bit, but curious,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.200
it sounds like you've typed up and are glancing at the, uh, the site right now.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.000
Any initial feedback before we maybe dive a little deeper next time?

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.880
This is interesting in, at least in some regards, obviously I have

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.320
not ever heard of this before.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.160
It's it only came out like literally three months ago.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:26.840
There is, I mean, I could see connections to this to both

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.840
strength finders and the MBTI.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.620
Actually, he brings it up in five dysfunctions of a team that he is a big fan

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.220
of MBTI and likes to do that across all of the teams he works with.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.660
So definitely some influence there.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:39.380
Yeah.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:44.620
The thing I think is the thing I like about MBTI is it really helps

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:50.370
promote understanding when used in the right context, right?

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:57.410
Um, an example is basically one example I bring up.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.890
So I know a lot about MBTI and I'm fairly certain I could

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:01.930
teach a course on it.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.170
Like way Ts and Fs look at the world is different.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.960
Just as an example, if I'm

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.360
these are intuitive and feeling for those that aren't doing

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.440
that the MBTI lingo TNF is thinking and feeling.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:15.760
That's right.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.360
Thinking and feeling.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:16.560
Yeah.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.160
What did I say?

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.200
Touching and feeling.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.120
That's not it.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:19.680
Yeah.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.560
No, that's a different letter.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.880
And that particular letter it's what it, what it's evaluating is your

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.480
general preference around how you decide.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.240
And so the other letters sort of focus on what sort of things do you

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.080
bring to the table to make the decision?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.160
The TNF is what standard, but is it that you use to decide and

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:46.880
T's sort of decide between right and wrong in a, in a logical sense.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:54.080
Fs their standard is good and bad on a, on a more of a morality sense.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.400
And one of the things that I've learned from using this is that if you go in and

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:05.880
have a conversation as a T with someone who's an F and say you're wrong

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:11.050
subconsciously, the way they interpret it is that you just told them they're

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.600
immoral, right, which will bit flip them.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.920
But the other thing, so you and I, we're very different on

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.800
strength finders, those results.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.280
And I just look at this list.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.400
I also suspect you and I will be very different.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.240
I think so too.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.200
Yeah, it's about, it's a little bit more about execution and how you

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.040
execute with your personality.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.240
Anyway, I'm curious.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.520
Oh, I'll take it as soon as I can.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:33.880
Yeah.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:40.290
So, I don't know, let me just segue and talk about how I've applied that second

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.890
one and maybe for next time, if you, if you take it and get some examples like,

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:44.970
Oh, Hey, I've done this before.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:51.450
So as our listeners know, a few months ago, maybe six months ago, I expanded

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.210
my role to cover a lot larger.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:31:00.170
Well, basically all of the infrastructure support and everything for services at

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:00.530
unity.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:05.570
So what that means is I have this team of roughly, roughly 75 people in

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.870
a variety of different roles, how the team had functioned previously and it

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.910
worked and I'm sure we all know teams like this, they're very busy.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:19.510
They did important work, but it was, it was just a lot of incremental

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.510
development across a whole bunch of different areas, which is good.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:24.630
They kept teams running.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.710
I mean, our, our slowest deployment pipeline is 40 minutes.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.430
So it's not like they were bad at anything.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.030
They're actually very effective.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.150
But one of the things I wanted to do the rally and cry, and I won't go

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:39.030
into any details on what our rallying cries were, but I picked a small

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.070
number of projects that these are some things we got to keep the business

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.390
running.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:47.150
We got to keep accelerating our every development team's ability to

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.830
deliver easier, faster, safer.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.110
We talked about that before, but also there are a few big rocks.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.910
I want to move.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:58.840
I wanted to ignore as much as possible organizational structure and say,

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.200
if you need help, ask for it.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.960
If there's something else, something happening outside of your direct team,

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.760
you think you'd have some insight on, please go work on that.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.640
Get your day job done, but, but please find ways to collaborate across

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.160
teams as we try and move these big rocks.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.680
So I set the rallying cry and Darna, if it didn't work, I mentioned

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.320
before you, I manage our documentation team.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.800
And one of the things we're working on is spinning up our own customer

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.840
facing doc portal.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.700
If they weren't in my team full of a bunch of people who really, who know

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.220
how to build pipelines and deploy stuff to web services, that would

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.980
have been a lot slower process.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.020
We just kicked that off short time ago and that pipeline is already built.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.980
And it works and it's magic and it's great, but this is multiple

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.380
teams working together.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.620
This is world of Warcraft guide to project management.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:53.380
We brought varying skill sets, regardless of managerial structure.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.900
And we're not a holocracy.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.380
We have people managers who are responsible for people's growth

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.740
and finding the right work, but we built a system in which they could

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:07.740
easily help each other out and find where they could align and

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.940
make sure everything got done.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.940
So pretty happy with that.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.220
Uh, but again, that came from the rallying cry.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.500
Like we're going to, we're going to work together on stuff.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.460
I'm going to provide some vehicles for you to discover what's happening

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.700
across the org and these few things are the important things that

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.660
we're really going to move on and set goals around.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.060
So also for those rallying cries, I put some pretty, put some pretty big goals

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.140
in place so they could have something hard to shoot for what they get from

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.460
that, which ends up being able to show progress is they get some metrics

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.500
that actually matter around those ideas.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.220
Yeah.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:45.460
I actually think I have a slightly different perspective on

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.020
what you did, but it's an alignment.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.700
I actually think what I, what happened here was, uh, what's this

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.620
last name, Johnson, Johnson,

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.360
Steven Johnson, where good ideas come from.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.200
Yep.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:58.640
Yeah.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.000
What are the books we should just make the modern testing

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.320
bookshelf with our favorites.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.360
Yeah.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:09.280
It's that one where accelerate accelerate how to measure anything.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.000
I think those would be, oh, and a lean startup.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.880
It probably goes.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.480
Yes.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.920
That is, that is a very good start.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.360
Yes.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.280
The, but right.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:26.920
You had constructed, so life had constructed an environment where these

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:32.720
two major, but typically separate big ideas were forced to come together.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:42.920
And then you further sort of motivated the birthing of new ideas.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.560
By, uh, your rallying cry.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.800
And I mean, I, this is from Steven Johnson's book, but it's, it's apropos

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.570
is this is my job as a manager or as a leader of a large team is to create

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.650
the right opportunities and a Steven Johnson says chance favors the

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:04.130
connected mind, my role is to make these opportunities for people to discover.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:09.970
One find work that's interesting to them and don't worry about organizational

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.570
boundaries and an org like mine where we don't ship a thing.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.730
We make lots and lots of things.

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.290
Having ownership within a team is going to be a bottleneck.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.330
Yeah.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.870
The, the, the thing that I think is a strong skill you have, uh, with

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:31.990
people on that front is, and I'm nowhere near as skilled as you, uh, on

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:38.270
this one is just motivating the discovery.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.830
Right.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.790
You have, I don't know how many people let's say 50 people underneath you.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:50.590
You have high confidence that they are as smart or smarter than you are.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:55.270
I have actually 75 people in every single one of them is smarter than me.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:56.030
Right.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:02.350
Your job is to get that smartness working together and knowing that once

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.470
you've achieved the tipping point of the maybe a fifth book, you can get out of the way.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.350
Your job is just to get it over, over the tipping point.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.390
Well, let me go to another one of my favorite books.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.150
This is the modern testing book episode.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:18.430
So the, the, the, the leaders guide to radical management.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:22.890
And this is the, um, what's his Facebook that'll come back to me in a minute.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:27.170
But this was a business writer worked for Rodoloff for Forbes magazine.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.210
Still writes for Forbes.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:29.490
Why am I spacing out?

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.770
Denny, not Denny, maybe Denny.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:37.100
Anyway, uh, he said, create an environment for people to work in and

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:37.940
get out of their way.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.220
And again, it's all different ways of saying the same thing.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:47.140
I have to give you a funny story here because I frequently tell my team, like,

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.180
I may have an idea, but please take all my ideas with a grain of salt.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.380
You're doing the work.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.620
You make the decisions.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.780
And I was talking, I can't remember if it was a one-on-one or a meeting.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.260
And I mentioned something and one of my newer leads was like, Alan said,

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.220
we should do this in, in, in a meeting.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.220
And everybody else being just laughed at him.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.950
Like, it doesn't matter what he says.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.750
We make it cause they know, they know they've worked for me for longer, but, uh,

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.750
largely we have that culture is that I could say, you know what?

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.870
I think we should only deploy on Saturdays.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:24.110
They would all tell me to go do something anatomically impossible with

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:28.670
myself because they know that I am not the one to make decisions like that.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:33.670
I am going, my, my job is to set them up so they can make the best decisions

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.190
because I, I, they're one, they're smarter than me to the closer to the work.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.550
Reminded me of that story.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.230
I thought it was funny.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:43.230
I had to go, no, here's what we should do.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:47.200
I could add a kind of phrase of like, I don't want to give all the details of,

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.480
I said, yeah, there could be a situation where it's, it's true.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.680
It's not universally true.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.160
I rely on you all to make the decision on what to do here.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.080
But most people get that after, you know, you have to, again, going back to

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.000
L'Ancioni, you communicate the rally and cry.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:08.640
You clarify the rally and cry, and then you communicate the rally and cry again,

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.240
something like that.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.840
It's working well.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.840
Oh, one other story.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.720
And again, going back to management is again, I'm going to be very fuzzy on

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.160
details, a lot of times just setting yourself up to take advantage of.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.660
You spend a lot of time setting yourself up to be ready for what happens next.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.020
Does that make sense?

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:27.660
Like you, you.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.660
I spend time making sure that I can be adaptive and I had a tiny little change

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.780
happen with the career director, someone on my team, and it immediately,

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.520
immediately solved a major, a major, I would say a problem or a challenge,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.720
but a structural thing I've been thinking about how to take care of on my team.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.560
By one person making a different choice, a bunch of stuff fell into place

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.800
perfectly and everybody involved is super excited about it.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.520
So being ready for those things is what I like to do.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.600
Just, I love adapting so much.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:06.160
And, uh, I've told my team this too, is that everything I do in management is agile.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.200
It's lean.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.440
I try, I will try stuff all the time with the expectation that a big chunk of it

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.730
won't work and they're getting used to that, which is great.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.630
So yeah.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.230
And that's what I do.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.030
And that's, that's, that's what, that's what energizes me is what allows me to be

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.590
a manager and not hate it.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:25.510
That yeah.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.670
You're in a perfect role.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:31.750
Like for the majority of the time I've known you, you've been anti-management.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.990
Right.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.350
Well, I didn't want to be a manager at Microsoft.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.670
Things are better now.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:42.120
But when at that time at Microsoft, it was on, how would you put it?

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.680
It wasn't a good thing to want to manage a high performing team.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.920
You wanted to manage a team with a few good people, a few, okay, people

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.600
and a few crappy people, because you had to fit a curve, whether you had

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.000
a curve or not, cause we had a curve and we didn't have a curve.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.880
The curve lasted through several different versions of the review cycle.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.170
I didn't want to deal with that.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:07.130
There was too much emotional and bureaucratic and political baggage

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:10.330
that came with being a manager at Microsoft for the majority of my career.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.650
There I've heard a lot of that's better now.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.570
It is a lot better, but I mean, we're not even.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.700
So I'd been here now 26 years and that really started when

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:29.620
Satya got here and it's still far from solidified the, but it's going

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.020
in the right direction, but I totally know what you're talking about.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:44.100
Like you were the review system physically incentivize you to construct heroes.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:45.680
Right.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.640
100% correct.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.480
Yeah.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:54.470
I mean, obviously heroes are rare and in the world that we're in now,

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:59.510
particularly Microsoft and in my case, I'm in Azure that that doesn't scale.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:05.050
Like you, you have too few heroes to come and save the day for all the different

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.210
problems that we're having.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.100
You need rockstar teams.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.820
Um, and if, and let me give you an example of, and again, it's, it's a

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.300
lot of different stuff I know, Mike, I don't, a lot of people have noted my,

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.500
uh, consistent denouncing of Microsoft.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.700
I found it hard to do the work that I loved doing there eventually.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.820
You know, one example, like here, if I have, say I have 30 people on my team,

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.140
just knock it out of the park and all deserve big raises.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.300
Let's say HR comes back and says, you don't have the budget for that.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.060
At Microsoft you're screwed, right?

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.100
I mean, I would go talk to our CEO about that and show data that

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.380
showed what people were doing.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.540
And I would get that budget we could take care of them.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.300
If people do good work, we can take care of them.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.420
Yeah.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.860
I don't, I don't, I mean, there is a budget.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.100
I can't just lie and say my whole team's great.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.180
Everyone gets a 20% raise.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.540
I can't do that.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:08.300
No, it's, it's, you can't do that.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:15.870
And even, and even if you could, um, it wouldn't be the right thing to do

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:20.700
because the point of the incentive model is to incentivize.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.980
And if you were to do something like that, it would, it would

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.260
probably lead to bad behaviors.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:26.580
Like, yeah.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.940
And like another thing, other one for the, the book list is we never call it out

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:36.780
explicitly, but a lot of our, I use Dan pink's autonomy, mastery, and purpose

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:42.140
model a lot, like our whole review discussion is based on tying the work

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.580
you do to purpose.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.100
So we worry about purpose a lot.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.620
And we want people to understand how the work they do impacts the company.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.540
And we, of course, as Dan pink says, pay them enough money where money is not

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.060
the issue and people are motivated by a reward in the short term, but in the

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:02.860
longterm they're more motivated by having work that they enjoy and that challenges

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.380
them, I'm not saying don't pay them.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.100
The motivation you get from a pay raise is short lived.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.420
It is.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:15.860
And there's been lots of different studies on this that essentially once

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:23.820
you've gotten past sort of a bare minimum of fiscal stability, I'll just

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:29.620
call it that way, whether, whether it be, you know, you have big dreams of,

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:36.500
you know, toys or, or really all you need money to do is to make sure you

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.020
don't have to worry about it, which is kind of, that's kind of the

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.580
position I'm in.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:47.260
I, I, I only want to get paid so much as I don't have to ever worry about it again.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:54.180
I had this, this goes back to some pains in my, in growing up that I just

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.220
like, look, I don't want to ever go back to that.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:00.540
And as long as I have enough to make sure that doesn't happen, it's great.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:05.500
Purpose then becomes the better incentive.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.660
And that's exactly it.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:12.140
And I love that our review is, which is we call them three Q's, three questions,

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.900
three times a year.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.220
The first thing we talk about is like, why is what you do important?

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.520
I do most of my discussion on that.

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.510
And then some are on mastery.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.350
We have a discussion around how it's going.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:27.870
And we ask questions around, usually I ask, what would you like to do more or

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.670
less of or start doing or stop doing?

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.980
Like a starfish with respect.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.300
Yeah.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:32.620
Yeah.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.660
And that, and we have a deep discussion about that.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.900
And it's stuff we talk about generally in one-on-ones, but three times a year,

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.140
we have a longer and deeper and more reflective one-on-one we call our

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.460
three key process, and it's about making sure we're connected with what

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.460
people want to do and making sure they enjoy.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:52.740
We are so lucky in this world to do jobs that are hard and challenging

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.380
and fun and get paid for them.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.930
So if anyone's not feeling challenged and having fun, I want to take care of

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.810
that because that's, that's, that's not good.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.530
That's no bueno.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.330
See no bueno.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.170
Do those words make sense?

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:09.770
No, I've heard them before.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.840
Spanish, not one of my languages.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.040
No bueno means not good.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:15.320
Yeah.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:15.560
Okay.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.000
I'm I'm, I am in the ballpark.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.320
So cool.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.040
So let's go ahead.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:20.600
It's a quick question.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.400
Well, what are the three questions again?

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.480
Oh, um, why is your mission important?

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760
What are you doing?

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.320
How are you doing?

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.560
Or how's it going?

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.440
That those are the questions, but my variation, every manager has their own

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.240
take on those.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.440
What I do with the why question is I make everyone tie their

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.560
mission to the customer.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.680
How does this help our customer?

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.680
So if they don't get there in their, in their first track at it, I walk them

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.920
there because it's for me, it's really important.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.240
They realize that we're at a size company where the work you do

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.880
affects our customers indirectly, but it affects them.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.960
And then what are you doing?

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.600
And again, I know the work they do.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.880
So I want to hear like, what are the, what are you most, what are you

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.280
most proud of over the last four months?

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.040
What's something you're really excited when you talk to your parents,

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.280
talking about your work, what do you talk about?

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.240
I want to get an idea of that gives me idea of motivation and then how it's

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.880
going, I mentioned before is the, is the starfish retro.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.720
And then I add the, the fourth question, which I think is super valuable

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.960
is I asked them, what can I do more or less to help you be successful in your

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.640
mission and it's just my way of getting some feedback from them.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.560
Yeah.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.240
And I actually think that's an important way to go.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:36.370
I was, I was, I was taking your three questions and then thinking through,

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:42.500
like, I, I like to keep these things simple and the more it, the more it's

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:49.880
simple, the more you can, you can have a really exciting partnership with your

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.680
report towards positive goals.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.160
Yeah.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.770
And that's where book plug again, this is going to be a record, but

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.770
radical candor says you have to, you care personally challenged directly.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:05.890
So the better relationship I can build with these people that work for me,

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:09.970
the easier it is for both of us to give that direct feedback to each other.

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:10.770
Yeah.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:16.730
And in that, that involves, I tell my staff, my very first

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.470
goal is to earn their trust.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:20.270
Absolutely.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.140
A million percent agree.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.430
All right.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.750
Cool.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:27.870
Well, we meandered our way through another AAB testing podcast.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:31.390
And as a teaser for next time, I'd like to talk about the, let's talk

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.590
about, let's start with working genius.

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:36.590
But if you have any other, maybe we'll just kind of walk through our results

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:38.030
on the other ones as well.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:42.630
It'll be like the personality type review episode.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.140
Is that the homework I got to take working genius and then bring in

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:47.820
the other things.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:47.860
Yeah.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.540
You can find it just to talk through them.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.460
I'm also curious to hear if there are others of these.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.260
I may also send you the quiz to help you figure out your Hogwarts house.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.940
Cause that may be fun to talk about too.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.630
You slithering you, but you're not really, you're not, you're, you're,

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:05.990
you're more of a Ravenclaw.

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:07.470
I think we'll find out.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.030
I'm the blue one.

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.070
I've done this test.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.470
I'd forget which one that is.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.070
I haven't done it.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:13.990
I'll have to figure it out.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:16.590
All right.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:17.070
Good.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:18.030
Okay, man.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:21.990
Thank you everyone for listening to yet another episode.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.350
Well, by the way, did you, someone came to our slack

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.910
group again, you can get a link from modern testing.org to join, but someone

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.110
said they started at episode one and are working their way through.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.550
And I can't imagine a more painful introduction to AB testing

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:38.300
than starting with episode one, but it happened.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.260
I think it's actually very enlightening.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.380
I've gone back and listened to it.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:52.980
And it's like you, if you were to binge on it, you very quickly see how we

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.500
improve and then how we're on our way back down again right now.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:57.700
Well, it could be, could be.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.340
We definitely have our ups and downs.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:48:59.700
All right.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:00.940
Well, this has been fun.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.700
