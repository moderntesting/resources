WEBVTT

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.660
A.V.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
Testing, the modern testing podcast.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.910
Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.910
I am Mindless Agile Robot.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.900
I must iterate.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.740
As we talk about software engineering, software quality, leadership, and whatever else comes

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.740
to mind.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.380
Now, on with the show.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.740
Hey, everybody.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.740
Howdy.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.010
It's episode 100.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.890
Three digits of A.V.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.890
Testing.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.610
I'm here with Brent and we have all three of our listeners on the line as well.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.050
And we will hear from each of them throughout this episode.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.490
So I say we...

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.370
Do you have anything to say, Brent?

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.370
Are you here?

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.650
No, let's go.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.650
I'm very excited about today.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.710
Okay.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.030
I cannot believe it's been 100 episodes, but I would...

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.790
I'm going to take some glory away from the three.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.260
And because this feels better for me to say it, but Brent, it is only your 99th episode.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I hate you.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.620
Just for the record, the look of despair on his face was priceless.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.860
Real quick, before we get started, I want to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.020
which is PractiTest, from Joel, who is one of the three who could not make it today.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.380
And PractiTest, triple dub dot practice test dot com.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.180
As you are aware, there is no one size fits all in testing.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.940
That's why they built PractiTest, to be a centralized solution that supports testing

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.980
of different types and sizes.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.780
Scripted, exploratory, automated, whatever.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.940
They envision a place where all testing data will reside, so stakeholders can generate

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.000
the information required for their needs.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Another issue they're trying to solve is that as you create more and more tests and more

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.600
types of tests, you end up having a lot of data in the system.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.840
And if you have too much data, it can be harmful because you may end up just not looking

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.360
at it at all.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.520
That's why they introduced a revolutionary approach to data organization.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.840
Instead of burying the data in folders within folders within folders, they allow users to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.160
work with hierarchical filter trees that are based on the same data you are storing.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.360
This enables you to organize information in more flexible and even multiple ways, helping

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.920
you to generate better reports and visibility into your product and process.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.480
They also believe that a tester's job is to not test for the sake of testing, as

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.400
we believe on ABI testing, but to create visibility and provide information that will

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.000
help the team release better products and do it faster.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.280
For that reason, having a platform that supports testing is not enough, and we put a lot of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.720
effort into the dashboard.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.520
They put a lot of effort into the dashboard and reporting metrics to make sure any stakeholders

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.240
can get the relevant information they need, in the format they need it and when they

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.340
need it.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.100
Brent and I got a tour of the product.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.700
We love it, and we think you should check it out.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.940
Again, it's triple dub dot practice test dot com.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.420
And now, on with the fun part of the show.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.420
Brent, you taking selfies?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.420
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.520
I'm just going to post them to Slack.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.040
We have a couple of our three listeners on the line.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.680
It looks like a whole bunch of them are in chat.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.960
I'm not sure how to do this.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.440
I'm just going to call on people.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.720
Is that cool?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.280
If you don't have any, if you're just here to listen to everything to say, maybe that's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.120
cool and we can always come back to people.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.560
Maybe I'll follow chat after I kind of go through everyone in alphabetical order and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.360
just say if you have something you want to say, a question you have for us.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.890
If you have a question, we will try and be brief.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.290
As I stare at Brent, we'll try and be brief.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.610
We must be brief and I will jot down notes of anything that we should dive into later.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.900
And maybe we'll just go through it that way.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.420
As you can tell, we're carefully planned and meticulous.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.140
Actually in a perfect world, our A.B.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.180
testing assistant would be here to, in like a green room, like they have on the radio

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.070
shows to kind of pre-screen the calls and bring them to us.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.070
So I'm going to go in alphabetical order, as I said, and we'll see if we can hear

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.950
people and get them on the show.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.150
I pressed the total wrong button.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.030
Antonio, why don't you unmute and say something to Brent and I?

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.830
I just want to thank you guys for everything you do for the community.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.110
You guys, between the five and five thing you do on your blog posts and all the podcasts

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.110
you do, the talks you guys give at different conferences, you guys put a lot out there

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.990
and you guys are trying to really make waves and evolve the testing community to be more

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.710
as basically the technology evolves and as everything evolves around us.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.070
I'm not going to lie, I don't agree with everything you guys say, but I do love the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.310
fact that you guys are doing a lot for the community and I've learned a lot in these

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.870
past, I'd say two years since I've been on the podcast listening to you guys.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.870
So thanks.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.870
Thank you, Tony.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.550
And after I heard you talk, I go, that's not on Tony.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.550
Oh, that's Tony.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.930
Thanks, man.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.890
That's really cool to hear.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.570
And then one thing Brent and I both brought in and for those not in the Slack channel

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.050
and not in the big well planned out far in advance thing, we have postcards.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.570
We both thought to bring in today because a bunch of you send in postcards thanking us

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.570
what we're doing.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.570
It's really, really cool.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.450
I tweeted a picture of one set that I received.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.970
So thank you everybody for that.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.170
That's super cool.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.410
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.090
As Alan and I have said on multiple times, oh, we should have brought the tequila today.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.460
We do this for this.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.220
This list of postcards I have on the desk right now is the whole reason why I'm in this.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.220
Cool, man.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.340
It's not for dealing with you, which by the way has been five years.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.020
And we've known each other longer than that.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.180
I never thought it would be like this, man.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.180
No.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.770
It's not going to be like this.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.770
Alright, who's next?

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.770
Cycling through.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.770
Andrew Morton.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.000
Hello.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Hi, I'm Hi, Brent.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
How are you?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Very well, Andrew.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Thank you.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Cool.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.560
So I'd just like to echo Antonio and thank you both for the podcast and especially for

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.200
the modern testing principles.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.600
I certainly managed to distill a lot of my own thinking in a much better, more eloquent

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.120
way than I ever could.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.320
So that's brilliant.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320
Thank you very much.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.080
I don't know that everyone's ever called me eloquent before.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080
Definitely not.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.640
I mean, people have called us charming, which we reject this notion.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.000
Yeah, actually, it's been an interditive process.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.960
We started, we went through it.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.320
Like I do like a lot of how the three have contributed.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.920
The MOT publish has really helped to simplify the language.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920
That's Ministry of Test?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920
Yep.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920
Yeah, I should know.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.320
I work for them, which is a disclaimer.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.590
So I don't know how much credit is us versus the community because that's really been an

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.590
iterative process.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.590
Yeah.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.550
And please reflect back on those of you that were around a year or a year and a half ago

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.530
and we first started coming up with the idea of principles, the community helped vet the

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.950
crap out of those.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:17.760
So a lot of the eloquence came out of a lot of debate and discussion, which I think

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760
is great.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.160
It's like the way I like to build software is the way we built the principles.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160
Yeah.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:30.000
And it's interesting that it's viewed as its own thing now, given that a non-trivial portion

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.840
of it was just blatantly stolen from people like Lisa and others.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.560
All right.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.720
Moving on down the list.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.960
Amanda.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.720
I wonder if you guys would get back to me.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.640
You disappeared down my list for a minute.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.180
I tend to be towards the top.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.180
Can you speak up?

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.180
You're pretty quiet in our headsets.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.470
Okay.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:02.470
I just switched machines to a new Windows 10 machine, so I'm still figuring out.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.470
Yeah.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.750
I blame Windows, but anyway, go on.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.750
This is actually my first Zoom meeting with the new machine.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.430
So we're all testing here.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.670
I have been listening for quite a while.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:22.990
I don't think quite all 100 episodes, but it's definitely my favorite podcast.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:30.870
It even beats the West Wing weekly, as in the order of excitement when the new episodes

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.870
drop.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.060
And disappointment after you listen for a while.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.100
Yeah, I'm thinking Amanda likes punishment.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.380
That's what it describes.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:51.230
Well, it's comforting to hear the rambling that my own brain rambles quite a bit, so

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.790
it's nice to hear the stream of consciousness isn't just confined to me.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:06.040
But I really appreciate the conversations that have happened on the podcast.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:15.520
In the time since I've started listening, I've taken over as a manager of a QA team, and

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.000
our previous manager had been managing since the 90s.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.720
So I really related, especially to the episode where we were doing the modern testing versus

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.160
old school testing.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.520
Yeah, that was fun.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:41.280
So I've that some of the things that were said in that episode in particular have really

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:48.240
helped me articulate why we need to modernize in some areas.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:57.120
I guess the, not really a question, I guess, but the challenge I'm facing right now is

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:05.370
how to have some of the tough conversations with my team who has been here since, not

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:11.130
since the 90s exactly, but they're very comfortable with the old school way of doing things.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.570
And I think that's really the change or die.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.930
I think I'm having to get increasingly frank with some people on that.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.850
So that's the current challenge I am dealing with.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:34.730
So I'm willing to hear more from the three as to how they've dealt with that either now

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.780
or online later on.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.940
It's interesting that you mentioned that because I've been talking...

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.100
I've sent a few samples in our Slack group, but I send a weekly newsletter to my quality

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.100
community.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.740
They're not even mine, the quality community at Unity.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.620
And one of the things I've been talking about quite a bit lately has been feedback and

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.400
how to give good feedback.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.880
And the other thing I do is I consider part of my job is growing leaders.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.040
We talk a lot about, there's this line from a book by Heffetz, which I've mentioned

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.720
50 times on the podcast.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.720
I mentioned, again, leadership on the line, which is, leadership is disappointing people

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.400
at a level they can absorb.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:19.520
And I love that line because you can't push them too hard or they freak out.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.120
But if you don't push them at all and they're complacent, you don't get any results.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.840
So it's just finding that right balance.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.320
We'll dive deep into that in an upcoming episode.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.160
But yeah, happy to help out there.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.000
Cool. Thanks for listening.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.800
Yeah.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.240
All right. Let's move on.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.360
Butch.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.400
Howdy.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.320
Happy 100th episode.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.120
Thank you.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.200
Yeah. Thanks for all that you'll do for the testing community.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.600
I do have a question.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.480
Awesome.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.440
I've got leaders in my organization, one in particular I had a conversation with.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.800
He's a developer lead.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.800
And how would you respond to someone who's in that role that says to me when I'm talking

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.760
about testing, you know the old saying, the person who wrote the code shouldn't be the

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.920
one to test their code.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.880
They've got their blinders on.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:14.390
How can I help drive a quality culture with that leader?

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:21.520
The thing I do the most in that situation is one is I stop myself from rolling my eyes.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.920
I don't.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.860
But pairing, pairing, pairing.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:31.620
I think pair testing with someone like that is so advantageous for both of you.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.220
You as the test specialist learn more about the ideas, what's going on into the implementation

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.460
of the code.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:44.960
But what I found 1000 times out of 1000 is that people are able to defocus, take those

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.520
blinders off and actually test their code pretty darn well.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.120
There are things that a good testing specialist will find that that developer won't find.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.720
But boy, they can.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.270
I have found again, every single case, no exception.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.710
Through pairing, I have been able to convince developers that not only have they been able

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.320
to test, but been able to test their own code.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.090
There are multiple techniques that I've seen that work very well.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:22.680
I'll say the ones when I'm in the management role, the one that I found the most effective

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:30.920
is I just basically say you're going to own the quality and we're not going to we're

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.800
going to my test resources are going to spend time on by resources.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.580
He means human beings.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:48.860
My test, Peter's, yes, are going to spend more of their time evaluating data in production.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.860
And so what we're going to do is grease the wheels for when they do check in, they go

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.940
straight to production.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.860
So I try to create a little bit of a fire saying, hey, I'm tired of test being a bottleneck.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.420
That's going to be able to check straight in.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:09.380
Here's the mitigations that I know of that work very well, as Alan pointed out, pair

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.380
programming.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:20.480
Although here, I would probably do a mob and have two devs pair programming with a tester

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.800
looking behind them asking questions.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.440
Because what you're really trying to do is is make them realize that that objectivity

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.680
or lack of objectivity mantra is baloney.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:47.030
Another great trick is just get a couple people going to and getting TDD training.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:54.420
TDD is absolutely my favorite way to start people into this.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.100
Alan's giving me the shut the hell up sign.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.140
I know how to recognize, oh, Brent's going to keep going, man.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.100
That's a start if that's not enough, ping us and we will talk more about that later.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.940
I want to make sure we don't skip the people whose name begins with Z.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.940
Awesome.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.940
Thank you all.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.940
Yeah, you're welcome, man.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.940
Thanks for listening.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.680
Chris Blaine.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680
Hi.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.680
I'm happy 100th.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.960
I really enjoy the fact that I think you've been able to move the testing conversations

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.920
forward that were probably stalled for a while in the testing community.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.480
That's something that I think is really important and it's fun to check in every week and hear

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.240
your thinking of all, see how you're moving through your careers.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.000
I'm very interested if we can get more this week about the end of the transformation that

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.840
you're doing, Alan, if you can talk about that yet.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840
Oh, yeah.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.840
Yeah.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:57.080
One of the things I want to do is work on having that quality culture and building that

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080
and things like that.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.190
So I'm always very keen to hear that when you talk about that.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:07.630
In the podcast each week, it's been really valuable to me and I think it's a great way

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.390
for the testing community at large to move forward.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.540
Alan, you're inspiring threes of people all over the world.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.540
I am.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.540
I am.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.540
So I finally officially start my new role at Unity on Monday.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:30.980
And I took job B, which is basically a director of delivery, working across our monetization

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:38.300
organization, which is largely ads, just helping that team of 160 engineers work together better,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.940
increase velocity, increase quality.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.340
So obviously I have my quality slant in there.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.180
I've described this as an iceberg job, meaning I go in knowing what about 10% of the role

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.340
is and as I start exploring that 10%, I'll discover eventually what the other 90% is.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.220
And I really like being in that situation, so I'm looking forward to that.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.840
But really that's all I know about it.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.560
I know I will spend the first couple weeks talking to a lot of people, figuring out what's

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560
up.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.080
And these are teams I work with before and people I work with before, so I have some pretty

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.880
good ideas going in.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.400
But there'll be a lot of discovery, figuring out what's going on.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.510
And there was some bureaucracy and red tape in the way of getting it over.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.030
The Unity is a new enough company, a small enough company, that internal transfers are

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.030
fairly rare.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:29.470
And internal transfers of senior roles are, I could be the first one ever.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.710
So there was some stuff involved in that.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.190
It's all taken care of finally, so I'm looking forward to get going.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:40.710
And I will be talking about that more and more as the episodes go on, so I'm looking

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.710
forward to that.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.430
Well, congrats on the role change.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.430
Yeah, it'll be fun.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.320
I'm pretty excited about it.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.680
All right.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.800
The one and only Chris Canst.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.000
Chris!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.640
Wow, that's a great intro.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640
Thank you.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.960
I want to know, I'm going to mess up so bad now that you said that.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:08.760
But no, I wanted to come on and say thanks to both of everything that you both are doing.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.360
I think the modern testing principles are great.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:19.320
I like that there's this North Star that people can use to understand what the future

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.280
of modern testing looks like.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.290
Even though a lot of these aren't new, the fact that they're all combined and packaged

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.090
makes a lot of sense.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:35.290
But my question is, have you seen from the people that you've talked to and the responses

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:39.810
that you've got, are there certain industries that are actually better able to adopt the

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.090
modern testing principles better than others?

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:49.450
Are consumer internet companies able to make that transition better than say, healthcare

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.050
companies or are mobile companies, that kind of thing?

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.850
Are there specific industries where it's much easier for them to go, oh, this makes

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.040
sense?

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040
Yes.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.290
All right.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.290
Next person?

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.290
No.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.480
I'm kidding.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.080
I'll go first.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.480
I do think it's very tightly aligned and there's a lot of literature on this around even

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.900
agile.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.900
Right.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:25.020
As you all know, modern testing principles has a strong foundation in agile and lean processes.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:35.630
I will definitely say if your product is something that's service-based, if you're not on something

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.710
like modern testing, you're already behind the times.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:48.550
And then going to the final scaler where there's something that's very, has a long lead time.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:58.300
For example, I saw a message recently about automated airplanes.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:05.900
Doing reactionary stuff, there needs to be a QA department for something along that line.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:13.080
To assure you minimize what we've called here as sort of catastrophes in production.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:23.420
The way I would phrase that is that the larger the risk, the more likely you need a dedicated

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.860
testing specialist or specialist.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.280
Yes.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.960
So that can be true in other aspects of software also.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.720
I will add to it in the larger the lead time.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.720
Yes.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.000
There is, I'll just throw another book reference out real quick.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.560
Steve Denning, I became a fan of his when he wrote a book called The Leader's Guide to

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.160
Radical Management.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.840
He's a business author, writes for Forbes, but he had discovered agile and seen a lot

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.400
of applications for it in business.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.920
So it was very early on, well fairly early on in the world of agile.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.600
So he didn't call out agile as much.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.600
But his latest book is called The Age of Agile or The Speed of Agile or something.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.720
You can look it up, Steve Denning.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.560
There's one profile of a team at Microsoft, but there's profiles of different industries

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.560
applying agile.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.640
And of course, as Brett mentioned, we're built upon agile.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.800
We're built upon, I mean, if you've read the lean startup, you can see where we stole a lot

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800
of stuff from.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.120
And we also build a lot on what Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote in agile testing.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.000
Full, stealing, you know, steal like an artist.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
That's what that would be.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.720
Oh no, I mean, the people we've stole from is long.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.920
True, true, true.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.280
We're near to seeing pop and dikes.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280
It's long list.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.370
Shall we go on?

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.370
Yeah.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.370
Where am I?

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.660
Connor.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.660
Hey guys.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.660
Hello, hello.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.660
Hi.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.660
Can you hear me okay?

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.950
Yes.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.950
Perfect.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:52.590
Yeah, I just said it, John, because I'm enjoying the podcast and I want to thank you for it.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.830
I kind of got to a point in my career where I no longer wanted to be the bottleneck.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.070
I wanted to learn more about coaching teams.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:05.750
I started to use analytics to develop how customers are using the product and also getting more

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.190
engaged with customers, getting on customer calls and getting involved more in beta.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:13.630
So at that point in my career, I saw the modern testing principle the first time, started

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.630
listening to the podcast.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.910
So it was really good at that point to make sure that I found modern testing principles.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.010
So I want to thank you both.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.010
Oh, you're welcome.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.010
You're welcome.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.010
Brent's tearing up a little just so you guys know.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.010
I am.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:30.410
So I have to listen to everyone coming in and say, oh, I want to be just like you, Alan.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.650
I want to be a coach too.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:38.130
But I absolutely love it when I hear people saying, oh yeah, I'm moving into the data.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.290
I'm moving into the customer analytics.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.450
I haven't yet heard anyone saying, yeah, I've dropped it.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:51.330
I'm following, I'm going into a data science role yet, but I've still got my fingers crossed.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.530
Lisa's the closest one.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.460
But even then, I think what's her title?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.860
I'll ask her in a minute.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.990
Yes.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.990
Right.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.390
Where was I?

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.390
Thank you very much, Connor.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.390
We're glad to have you on board.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.390
We'll grab our help once in a while.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.390
Emma.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.390
Hello, everyone.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.550
Hello.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.550
Can you hear me?

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.550
Yes.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.640
Yes.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640
Congratulations to this episode.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.640
This is my first time live with you.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.640
I'm very interested in modern testing.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:32.640
I'm following your video in YouTube and also in Slack channel.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:44.640
I have good news that I'll speak about modern testing in a conference, in IEEE DTS conference

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640
next.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:55.640
I'll talk about the transition from traditional agile and modern testing, also the role of

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.640
a Gila coach.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:06.640
So, I'm very glad to be here and hope to, it's a challenge, modern testing, really a big

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640
challenge for me.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.640
And I'm learning a lot when following you.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.020
Thank you, everyone.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:21.020
I'm so excited to hear about, this is not the first time, but I'm loving that other

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.020
people are talking about modern testing.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.020
It's exciting to me.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.020
It's fantastic.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.020
Grant, we made a thing.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.020
Yeah, I know, right?

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.020
It's really cool.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.020
We're very excited.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.020
Please let us know how it goes.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.020
I'm both flattered and excited and all those things.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:43.020
Yeah, I'd love to, when you've done the presentation, I'd love to have the, to get

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:50.650
the deck up on the Slack channel and as well as hear your sense of how it went.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:51.650
Awesome.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:52.650
Thank you, Emna.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.750
Glad to have you here.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:25:01.750
And then someone who gets name dropped on the show more than once, Lisa Crispin.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.580
It's so exciting to be here.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.580
Congratulations on number 100.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.580
Yeah.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.580
Thank you, Lisa.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:14.580
I'm trying to remember why I started listening to your podcast.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.580
I'm not going to say that.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.580
I'm not going to say that.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.580
I'm going to say that.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.580
But I happened to start listening right at episode 60, I think.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.580
And you did that.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:27.580
You did mention me and Janet in our book and I was like, wow, they have, they have

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.580
found value in our book.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.580
And of course all the other people who contributed to our books.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.580
And so that was exciting.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.580
And of course, flattery gets you everywhere.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.580
So I started listening, but, but really truly, you know, I was listening to that justice.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.580
Like I had just heard Angie Jones on a different podcast talking about testing

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.580
artificial intelligence and machine learning.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.580
And, you know, I was getting interested in data science.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.580
And hearing this hearing you talk about the next step after being an agile

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.580
tester, you really need to learn this data science thing.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.580
You need to ramp up the coaching thing.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.580
And the coaching thing helped me right away in the job I was in because, you

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.580
know, I was supporting up to 20 developers at one time and kind of switched

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.580
over to that test consultant role there, which is something Janet and I

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.580
always had promoted, but not to that extent.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.580
And that worked really well.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.580
And then just getting interested in the data science and machine learning

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.580
led me into my current job.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:28.580
I was testing advocate for a vendor whose tool uses data science and machine

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.580
learning.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.580
And I have not learned about enough about those things yet, but it's super fun.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.580
So thank you.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.580
You've like helped me transform my career, which is really exciting.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.580
Well, yeah.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.580
As you know, we stole a great deal from it.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:48.580
You know, in a lot of contexts, we do frame what we're talking about as sort

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.580
of the next logical step from agile testing.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.580
Right.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.580
They're not mutually exclusive by any means.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.580
Exactly.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.580
And then one thing I wanted to mention, I mentioned this once before on the

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.580
podcast.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.580
It's worth mentioning again because I mentioned my community, my quality

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.580
community at Unity.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.580
And it was about maybe two or three months into my role there.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.580
I started there over two years ago when I realized, oh, I really have a

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.580
community, this matrix organization.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.580
I'm big on building communities, as Brent knows, and that's helped connect

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.580
people.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.580
But it was then like maybe three or four months later, I was rereading

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.580
agile testing.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.580
And then right there, maybe it's chapter three, the book on managing

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.580
teams talks about the manager runs a community.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.580
Totally paraphrased.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.060
I thought, yes, yes.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.060
And maybe, I don't know if it was something I'd read and forgot about,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.060
something that was like in my subconscious.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.060
But I love when I read a book and it reaches the same conclusions I

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.060
reached on my own.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.060
It feels validating.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.060
Worth mentioning because I mentioned community earlier.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.060
Well, that is nice to hear.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.060
And it's nice to hear it works for other people.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.060
Yeah.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.060
That's exactly what we think about modern testing.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.350
Very cool.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.350
Thank you for listening, Lisa.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.350
It means a lot to us.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.350
Thank you.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:11.350
And Lisa, let me know how I can help you on understanding the

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.350
data science part deeper.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.410
Awesome.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.410
Thank you.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:16.410
Yeah.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.410
We will.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.410
But happy to make that happen.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:19.800
Cool.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.180
Matt.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.620
Matt Dills.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.620
He might have fell asleep.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.620
Can I come back to Matt?

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.620
He says he doesn't have a mic.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.620
Oh, that's cool.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.620
Cool.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.620
Thank you for listening.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.620
Thanks for being here.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.620
Thanks for listening in.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.620
If you have anything you want to say, you can check it in chat

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.620
and someone can read it to me.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:44.620
But it looks like there's a Real Salt Lake fan on the podcast.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.620
And as you all know in our prediction episode, I predicted

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.620
good things for the sounders who are doing very well as opposed

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.620
to Real Salt Lake.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.620
But Michael Richards, what do you have to say?

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.620
You had to bring that up, didn't you?

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.620
Yeah.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.840
Long time listener, first time caller here.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.840
But not first time on the podcast.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.840
That's correct.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.840
Yeah.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.840
Yeah.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.840
Considering that, you know, happy 99th, Brent.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840
Anyway.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840
Yeah.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840
So we're done.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.910
Long time listeners.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.910
We did like in the 40s.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:17.910
I was at Test Bash Philly and I recorded a whole episode of AB

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:18.910
testing podcast without Brent.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:19.910
That just means I get to do this twice.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:20.910
So I'll do it next episode.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.910
Percy and Michael and Vernon joined me for a podcast recording.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.910
It was a lot of fun.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:24.910
Anyway, go on.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:25.910
At some point, Brent, you're going to be doing a test

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.160
test.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160
We're going to be doing a, a podcast recording.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.660
It was a lot of fun anyway, go on.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.160
At some point, you're going to have a deal.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.160
And without, without Alan somehow some way you can't figure out how to use the equipment.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.600
No, I can figure it out.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:49.120
I have a teenager and we started the equipment in my office.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.540
So maybe that's what I'll do.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:54.480
Is I'll just meet him, we'll just record one.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.480
Sure.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.880
Anyway, please go ahead.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.920
I really appreciate all the, the guidance on that.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.920
That's the best thing I can say.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.920
Alan, you specifically have been kind of a mentor to me,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.080
and I appreciate that because it's really helped drive

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.500
the last three to five years of my experiences

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.880
in the testing world and where I've come

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.920
and where things are going.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.440
And I really vividly see how the industry

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.800
is gonna change in the next five years,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.320
and it can't be stopped.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.680
And I really appreciate everything that you have done

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.460
and how you kind of coalesce all the ideas

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.160
that are out there into one central point.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.200
I love how he phrased that.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.500
One of the things that I think we've been trying to do

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:40.360
for the last five years is just get people to see this

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.460
and that it's not a negative thing.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.320
It is, in my humble opinion, just a matter of time.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.800
It really can't be stopped

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.440
because it doesn't make business sense.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.360
There's context, as we covered with Chris's question,

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.300
there's context where it makes sense and it doesn't today,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.690
but I think even then it's gonna change over time.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:06.690
And so hopefully we've inspired several people to,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.370
there's a phrase I use,

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.270
you can either be the butterfly or you can be the wind.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.210
And I'm hoping we've inspired a lot of folks

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.340
to be the wind instead of the butterfly.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.340
And I will say in my closing is,

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.640
let's hope there's a hundred more.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.320
Here's 200 more episodes.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.320
Ooh, another five years with Alan.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.320
Another five years.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.320
Oh my God.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.440
Yeah.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.210
Luckily it's only once every two weeks.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.530
So we may be able to survive.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.690
As long as you don't die before then.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.530
Or you.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.290
All right, back on positive notes, Mohammed.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.600
Hi, I just wanted to say thank you for the hundredth episode.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.720
I've been hearing your podcasts since a while

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.040
and has been amazing.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.120
And I just want to say to Alan that is article fear factor

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.520
and the sentence for making the job obsolete

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.600
and I just have like been an eye opener for myself.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.160
So thanks for that.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.730
And can you hear me by the way?

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.090
Yeah, we gotcha.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:04.930
Awesome.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.290
And the modern testing principles,

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.450
I mean, they're quite interesting because you know,

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:12.290
we've never met and this is how somehow we drive

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.370
our testing in the company I work for,

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.890
which was like quite interesting.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.690
So thanks for that as well.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.610
Yeah, this is everything I have to say.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.450
Thanks.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.970
Hey, Mohammed, just making sure,

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.810
I think I know who you are from the Slack channel.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.770
Are you a developer now?

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.330
No, no, no, I don't think you know me.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.290
No, I work for a company called Acres Global.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.560
I'm a key principle guy there.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.880
Okay.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.840
All right.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.160
Wrong fellow, but thank you for listening.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.430
Glad we're able to help.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.430
On the podcast for the second time ever,

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.070
along with Michael Richards, Percy.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.030
Hey, hey.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.100
Hey, Percy from New Jersey.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.460
Percy from Jersey.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.260
Thanks for getting that dad joke.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.860
Of course, takes one to know on, right?

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.020
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.100
Love dad jokes.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.580
All right, man.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.900
So I actually remember when I started listening

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.340
to AB testing, I'm gonna give credit for,

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.540
credit is due and that's to Michael Larson

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.300
for putting up a blog post on,

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.420
I think he wrote like an end of year blog post that says,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.140
these are the best podcasts that you need

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.660
to be able to listen to for the incoming year.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.460
And on that list is AB testing.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.860
And I think you guys just put out

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.940
the last episode of 2014.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.780
So that would be somewhere in the teens still.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.620
So that was the first time I actually-

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.280
It wasn't even very good back then.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.840
Well, that was like, I got lucky with that episode

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.520
because I think you guys were talking about,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.000
you know, the fundamental differences

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.920
between generalizing specialists

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.120
and specializing generalists.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.760
And then it kind of, my interest just kind of

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.160
ballooned from there.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.440
Was that the one where Alan and I finally close

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.980
on the debate between him and I on this one?

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.860
It might have been.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.980
I mean, you guys were still both in Microsoft

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.460
and well, of course, it kind of was a tangent fest too.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.020
So it was a typical episode.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.140
I must say, right?

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.000
But yeah, I can't thank you guys enough for,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.320
you know, the amount of work that you guys have put in,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.640
you know, the fact that you guys listened to us

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.760
or even take the time to listen to us

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.440
with our really highly opinionated,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.960
you know, ideas sometimes completely canner

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.960
against what you guys are thinking about.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.400
It did force me to think about a lot of stuff.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.920
And I've gone to apply specifically a lot

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.240
within the data science stuff

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.640
that Brent has been talking about,

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.080
you know, how we were able to improve,

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.360
you know, simplifying our regression strategy

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.040
and looking into, you know, customer usage data

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.160
as well as performance testing.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.620
Actually that did streamline a lot of the stuff

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.020
that we work when it comes to performance test design

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.900
and looking into how our customers actually use the product

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.260
instead of just thinking,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.380
maybe this is how they will use our product.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.780
So we have, you know, very decent source of truth,

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.620
you know, from there.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.460
Man, I can go on forever,

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.020
but I'm going to yield the floor to whoever's next.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.140
Again, thank you so much for, you know,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.420
putting up with everyone else

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.180
and making sure your ideas are being known

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.540
to the rest of the world.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:33.580
I will say before Alan has a chance that of all the three,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.820
I actually think Percy has personally put more effort

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.780
into the podcast than Alan or I have.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.380
He created the Slack channel.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.900
He actually even invented the hashtag one of the three.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.660
Thanks for being with us all this time, Percy,

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.320
and thanks for being such an active participant.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.280
Yeah, thanks, thank you, thank you.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.960
And I would also say that, you know,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.120
you thank us for like listening to the community,

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.880
but we can't do it without you.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.040
So we need, we rely on your feedback.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.560
We rely on your strong opinions.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.400
We rely on what you like and don't like.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.630
That's, it's principle number five.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.990
We, only you, our customer,

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.190
are able to evaluate the quality of what we produce.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.030
So we want to take your feedback

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.870
and use that to answer questions,

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.110
to figure out topics we need to explain better,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.750
where we need to dive deeper.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.110
Which reminds me, I have to make an announcement later,

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.660
I forgot, but remind me.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.500
Okay.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.500
It just popped up, that was a tangent.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.100
I didn't go down there, I shelved it.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.380
It's an A-B testing first.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.540
Yeah, this is hard.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.120
I was going to give an introduction,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.040
but I will wait till after he talks,

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.080
and then I'll talk about some stuff that Rob's been doing.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.940
So Rob.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.820
Hello?

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.660
Oh, you can hear me.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.380
Am I the only Rob?

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.780
You're the only Rob.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.020
Oh, okay, yeah.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.580
So I love the podcast actually, guys.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.740
So I wanted to thank you, like everyone else.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.300
And weirdly enough, I think I was doing modern testing

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.500
before I even knew what modern testing was.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.060
So I started hearing some interesting things around

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.980
about modern testing, now rent and stuff.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.390
I think I'm doing color actually.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:25.830
I've introduced the modern testing podcast to me.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.750
You know, I've had huge interest in testability

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.550
and a huge interest in quality coaching and test coaching.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.510
And I've been working as a test coach now probably

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.430
for two years.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:37.710
Talk a lot about that.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.790
Connor as well works on that kind of stuff with me

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:40.830
and quality engineering.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.270
And what we've been doing is working together

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.150
to build a vision for the future of testing

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.070
in our organization and the principles

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.510
and your podcasts have influenced that greatly as well.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.350
So it's been a big, big factor for us.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.350
So I just really wanted to thank you for that.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.110
Really, really cool ideas, pushing the boundaries

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.030
and there's so much in common with my own beliefs

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.990
and thoughts around testing that I had to be

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:11.030
on the call today to just say thanks as well.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.310
Totally appreciate that.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:16.990
Where are you in your business culture change?

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.630
So yeah, so as I said, I'm head of testing

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.150
and a quality coach.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.030
So I work with a team of testers

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.910
and we're trying to influence the change

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.510
and testing across the organization.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.550
So I actually work with the development teams

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:35.510
to actually build testability into the product,

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:40.510
identify quality goals and I'm more influenced

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.430
to teams rather than actually test anymore.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.790
So I do very little testing anymore, unfortunately,

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:48.670
but it's more around strategy and direction

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.060
and developing, identifying goals

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.820
and building good practices that allow our teams

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.580
to deliver quality quicker.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.980
Awesome, love it.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.660
That's a such a.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.260
That mantra, I think is the single most important thing,

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.540
what you just said is, right?

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:12.260
So for so long, test has been accused of slowing things down

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.620
or stopping ship and we need to change that direction.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:21.460
It needs to be quality and speed, not or.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.380
Yeah, yeah, so the maintenance.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.820
So what's great for us now is we've moved away

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.020
from the area from focusing primarily on automation,

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.540
maintaining debugging and automation.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.100
And we're going and doing the things

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.140
that you're discussing like the looking at data analytics,

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.100
driving our understanding the user using the data analytics

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.940
but also things like ethnographic research, things like that.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.820
So we go and use the research talk directly to them.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.660
We were very big, I pushed user story mapping

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.100
in a big way so we get different elements

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.940
of the business involved in the conversation

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.220
before we build anything

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.660
and getting those diverse perspectives involved

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.580
is hugely important to understanding quality,

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.740
not just from a user's perspective

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.180
but from the perspectives of everyone

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.780
who interacts with the product.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.660
So there's also things around building skills

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.820
across the teams in deep exploratory testing

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:16.020
and risk analysis and a whole host of things.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.180
Very cool to hear.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.060
And the introduction I was going to add is like,

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.660
I know from talks you've done, I think at Test Bash.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.180
Yeah.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.020
That you're doing that,

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.940
you're into that coaching consulting world,

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.060
which I think is at some point,

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.460
maybe that's the next talk I give about modern testing

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.980
is postmodern testing

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.340
and talk about what roles people move into.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.940
I can talk about myself of course.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.100
There are other people like,

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.860
I can talk about Brent moving into a data science role.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.020
I can talk about you moving into a coaching role.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.660
I think there may be something there.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.540
So I'm glad you're doing what we're doing.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.180
Yeah, it's very interesting

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.220
because Test just have these critical thinking skills

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.940
and analysis skills that can be applied

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.460
in a fractal manner across businesses

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.260
with different layers in different ways.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.940
So whether you start with hypothesis driven development

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.700
and others just loads of stuff that we can use.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.700
I love everything you're saying, Rob.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.700
Everything.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.140
Brent's giggling.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:15.980
All right, man.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.820
Thanks a lot.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.660
Thank you very much.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.260
Is this so cool to hear?

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.940
We should have 100th episode more often.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.980
We could do it next time.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.580
It'll be mine apparently.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.420
Yeah.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.420
There'll be one, we'll move on.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.690
We have the infamous and up.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.090
I guess it's not too late in Europe.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.970
As Brent refers to him, Pratrick.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.810
That is the rest of us calling him

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:48.210
the test pappy himself, Patrick Prill.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:49.050
Hi guys.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:49.890
Hi Patrick.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.130
Or Pratrick.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:53.730
Pratrick.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.570
Hi, Pills.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:55.410
No.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.800
Cheers guys.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.960
No, thank you guys for 100 episodes.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.200
It's really great to be there from, I don't know.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.760
I think I started around episode 15 or so.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.910
So it's really great how you evolve the podcast.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.230
And I really have to say that the six little words

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.350
of accelerate the achievement of show up with quality

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.490
really changed my world.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:22.450
And these six little words really influenced my attitude

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.930
and how to approach my daily work and my decisions.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.860
So thank you for those.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.860
You're welcome.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:37.110
I think that was a breakthrough for a lot of folks.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.510
Certainly was for me.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.700
Yeah, it definitely was a change in the discussions

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.020
in the podcast.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:51.020
When you guys found that very short summary

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.140
and you were, I remember that you were very happy

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.980
when you found that.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.780
And I think that influenced all that modern testing

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.140
principle idea.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.540
So that was really, really great.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.140
I was just, my mind was wandering back

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.840
and of course you've been listening for a long time.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.240
You've kind of seen, just seeing it guys know,

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:20.400
Brent and I rarely talk outside of the podcast recording,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.080
especially since I left Microsoft.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.680
Occasionally there'll be a message back and forth on Slack.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.680
Maybe I have something I want feedback on or an idea.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.680
But really everything we've, you've witnessed as listeners

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.840
the development of everything we've done

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:39.180
because we've done 99% of it recorded

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.500
and then published to the internet.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.940
So I just kind of thinking back,

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.240
I remember having the notion,

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.160
I think I just read Ray Dalio's principles

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.400
and having a notion that we should have modern,

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.720
we've been talking about modern testing for a while,

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.480
we should have principles.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.960
And then I wrote some out and Brent-

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.000
Slaughtered them.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.040
Yeah, which I love.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:05.040
I think I really believe in good ideas

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.640
coming from fierce debate.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.080
And then we brought them to the community

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.120
and there was more debate.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.480
Then we talked about them and they got tweaked more.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.520
And we thought they would keep on changing

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.440
and changing and changing,

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.680
but they've been solid now for like a year?

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.840
No, more than a year.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.940
As I get older, I refuse to stop,

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.180
to look back in time and go,

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.660
how long has it been since?

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.940
No, I'm just, the reflection was not the time.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.780
It's just the...

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:39.060
When you see something come as the evolution,

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.380
it's like, how did these start?

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.020
What's the origin story of these?

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.300
And how did they evolve into this?

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.140
I don't really recall all the details.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.180
I'd have to go back.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.380
But the cool thing is I could go back

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.860
and listen to all of our episodes and figure it out.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.140
Yeah, and I still think it's a living document.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:56.980
For sure.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.460
The thing is, as mentioned,

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.420
for a lot of folks,

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.660
modern testing principles are the past already,

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.020
but for a lot of folks,

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:12.020
it is still very much sort of a North Star visionary

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.220
statement.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.100
And so I think it'll probably still change

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.640
as the world shifts towards, well duh,

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.480
on where it stands.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.340
So for Patrick,

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.420
one of my favorite things is,

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.460
yeah, he joined the Slack channel early on.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.300
And

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.380
if there was,

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.620
I'll just put it this way,

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.380
if there was something stupid, Alan and I said on the podcast,

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:49.660
I could always count on Patrick to call us out.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.700
And then we could fix it,

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.980
adjust it or clarify.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.980
Early on in the formative days,

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:02.980
Patrick was super important to us.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.460
Thank you for that, Patrick.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.700
You're very welcome.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:12.100
I hope you stick around for the next 100 or 10 or one even.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.320
Of course.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.240
Cool.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.840
I'm gonna mispronounce his name,

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.040
so please correct me.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:19.880
Is it Yuros?

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.840
It's Yuros, but

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.400
thanks for trying.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.240
Okay.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.680
First of all, I want to congratulate you guys

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.280
on a 100 episode.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.120
Thank you.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.280
And I was introduced to ABA testing podcast by Patrick

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.760
as a matter of speaking.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.060
So thank you, Patrick, for that.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.740
And it was right around when you started talking

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.410
about modern testing.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.610
And what struck me most about it is

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:58.770
that I felt like I was doing a lot of things already

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.850
that you were already talking about,

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.710
but you put it so nicely into the words.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.950
And to be honest,

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:12.070
I'm still distilling all the principles

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.950
and all the, let's say, important details

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.280
that you are talking about them.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.360
And if you're okay,

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.200
I would like to also contact you in the future

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.480
about some things that I have in my mind.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.880
So maybe some details to discuss about.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.200
Of course, of course.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.100
Okay, thank you.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.420
And the last thing I wanted to say,

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.860
I enjoy your banter at the beginning of the episodes.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.180
I learned some important stuff about cooking,

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.660
about music and whatnot.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.900
So thank you for that as well.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.140
And I wish you many more episodes.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.020
Thank you very much.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.100
I do have to admit,

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.420
sometimes they go on a little bit too long.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.660
Yeah.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.580
I do know there are listeners,

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.500
probably none of you,

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.660
but I do know there are listeners

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.260
that kind of skip the first 10 minutes

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.380
and wait for us to talk about something interesting.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.990
And that's fine.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.830
I will say,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:08.110
like one of the first reviews we ever got

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.550
for A-B testing was something along the lines of,

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:15.110
it's two guys babbling about,

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:20.350
their vibe was two guys babbling about testing over beers.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:23.580
We've never actually had beers here,

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.940
but I do like that spirit.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.460
I do think it's part of the charisma of the...

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.860
That was Michael Larson.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.860
That was the post from Michael Larson.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.100
I was like, two guys having beers.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.700
Not knowing we recorded eight o'clock in the morning.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.150
No.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.990
Thank you.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.830
Thank you, Eros.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:44.110
And one thing I wanted to mention,

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:48.790
and before, I'll make sure I haven't missed anybody,

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.310
but it was Test Bash one year ago,

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:55.390
almost exactly where I first gave a talk on modern testing.

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:56.630
We haven't talked about it for a while,

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:58.670
but we've been talking about it when I submitted,

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.030
and I'm glad they accepted the talk.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.220
And it was fun to talk about,

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.220
and this is on the dojo.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.180
It's their only,

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.020
as far as I know,

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:09.060
it's still the only ministry attest talk on their dojo

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.500
with an explicit tag on it.

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:13.670
I got excited.

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:17.510
And when I gave that talk,

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.980
the thing that really struck me,

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.820
and people came up to me,

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.940
they weren't freaked out,

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.820
but I had people come up to me and say that,

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.140
thank you for giving a label

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.820
to the thing I've already been doing.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.340
I thought, oh my gosh,

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.040
it's not, I'm not scaring the crap out of people.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.400
This is something they're actually,

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.880
they see happening, something they're already doing.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.200
So that was really great.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.520
Then the one, actually, did I skip anybody?

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.880
If I skipped you because I'm blind,

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.560
please unmute and talk.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:54.690
Otherwise, I'll make a quick announcement.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:55.650
Okay, I'm good.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.970
I mentioned Ministry of Test for Big Fans,

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.810
Ministry of Testing, Test Bash,

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:01.570
big fans of that conference.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.130
I don't know if I've even mentioned this to you, Brent,

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.490
but I am working with Ministry of Testing,

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.410
literally as we speak.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:11.090
Sometime in 2019,

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:13.170
Ministry of Testing will debut

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:17.050
a nine-part course on modern testing.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.930
Whoa, cool.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:21.930
An introduction episode, one for each principle,

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.570
and then a recap on post,

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:25.730
or talk about post-modern testing, as we call it,

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.570
what happens after modern testing.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.330
So there'll be, the plan is,

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:32.300
each is only about five minutes long,

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.420
and the idea is to give people a lot more.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.860
It'll be, I expect it will be,

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:41.500
each course will be the super condensed version

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.500
of the deep dives we did on the podcast,

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.540
and I'll use those for resources.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:47.820
Lesson plans are done,

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.260
that course is planned is done,

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.580
working through those,

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.780
it'll take a while to get the work done,

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.300
but I'm pretty excited about that.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.860
Do you wanna send that to me?

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.980
I will send you a link to the lesson plans,

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.660
you can start giving me feedback.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.220
Okay, cause one of the things

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.380
that I intend to do this weekend,

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.940
and I'll do it just before we publish,

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.180
I've decided to,

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.380
that my penultimate blog post

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.900
on Testastic will be this weekend.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.060
It will be the document we've been

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:21.260
working on around modern testing.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.120
That will be,

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.160
I will write up my final words on that one,

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.480
post it as a blog post,

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.280
and that I intend to be the last

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.360
blog post I ever do on Testastic.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.640
When was the last blog post ever on Testastic?

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.680
Wasn't that a long time ago?

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.650
It's two or three years now.

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:43.860
It's the,

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.940
it doesn't, the brand is a great brand,

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:52.940
but it's not who I am anymore.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.190
And your announcement?

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.110
That was it.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:56.950
Oh, okay.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:57.790
That was it.

00:51:57.790 --> 00:51:58.830
And also one big shout out,

00:51:58.830 --> 00:51:59.950
not on the podcast today,

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.190
but one thing,

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:04.190
again, our community and you guys are

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.590
just huge for us.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:08.430
And if you're not on the Slack group,

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:09.390
you should really get on there,

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:11.870
cause I'm gonna totally butcher this thing.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.900
It's Massiej Rodek,

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.900
and that's probably wrong,

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.620
but that's the best I can do.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:21.740
He listened to all of our principles episodes

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:22.900
and the follow ups,

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.060
and made a magnificent and huge

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.500
and detailed mind map of modern testing.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.340
And that will get referenced and credited

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.540
throughout this course I'm building,

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.780
cause it's just a really nice,

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.460
it's just a fantastic job.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.020
So thank you.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.860
As you listen to this,

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.500
please accept my thanks,

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.220
even though I probably pronounced your name horribly.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.620
It's really incredible.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.060
It did a fantastic job.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:54.500
I recently saw that he did a post on it as well.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.460
I haven't yet gotten Google to go and translate it,

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.180
cause he wrote it in,

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.140
I think he's Polish.

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.540
Check out the Microsoft employees in Google.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.620
That's nice.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.940
Oh, we're a different company now, dude.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.620
It's all about what it takes to get it done.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.700
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.940
We'll talk about other things later.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.860
This was fun.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.300
I just wanna thank all of you.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.220
You can unmute and yell stuff at us in a minute.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.940
But just for being a part of this

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.140
and kind of taking this crazy idea

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:27.260
to have a bunch of listeners talk to us on the show.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.620
And I would say this even if a lot of you

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.580
didn't give us praise.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.180
Just, I'm glad it worked out.

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.260
Hopefully the recording comes out.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.060
Otherwise, this is just a private show

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.420
for about 20 people and we call it good.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.900
Or we can do it again next week on The Real 100.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.660
But really appreciate it.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.420
This is, it's, we never thought it would be,

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.540
the podcast would be a thing.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.900
So it's just super exciting.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.340
And really, I just have a lot of gratitude

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.180
for everyone who's even listened to one episode.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.020
So thank you.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.770
Yes, absolutely.

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:03.490
All right, we're gonna call that good

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:05.410
and I'll get this edited and published

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.050
to the Slack channel hopefully tonight,

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:08.170
but over the weekend for sure.

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:10.330
And then out to the masses on Monday.

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:13.410
Hopefully it includes all three of our voices,

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:15.290
or 20, whatever they were.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.010
And we'll see you next time for 101.

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.690
Do we wanna let the, you wanna unmute all of them?

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.290
Let the three do the sign off.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.450
All right, three, sign on and give everyone a big goodbye.

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:28.290
Good luck.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:32.920
Just letting my dog say goodbye.

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.560
All right, goodbye everyone.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.400
Thanks.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.920
See you guys next week for The Real 100 and 101.
