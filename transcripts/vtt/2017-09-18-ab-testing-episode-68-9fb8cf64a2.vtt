WEBVTT

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.630
Howdy, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're here for another episode of AB testing. I think we're at 68.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.430
68.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.430
Welcome to episode 68.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.870
We are way ahead of schedule. No, we're not. We predicted in the year episode would be I think 70. Yeah, we're not doing anymore.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.250
No, this is the last one. I'm divorcing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.600
Meanwhile three people on the internet are going, no, no.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.740
Are they? Are they? Are they going?

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.540
Yeah, okay.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.300
Potentially. Potentially.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.740
Okay, so how you been? What's new? Anything new and exciting in the Jensen household?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.380
It's been a rough week this last week

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.980
working lots of hours and then to top it all off

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.380
at around 3 o'clock in the morning

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.020
woke up with a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.280
massive leg cramp. I'm tired. I'm in pain. Okay, so Brent. This should be an amusing episode.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.380
Bad mood and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
we have some things to get through and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.260
because Brent's slow we're starting a little late because did you sleep in your office? Did I wake you up when I got here?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.460
No, no, I had my text. I was I was

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
having a one-on-one with an employee.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.940
You are you are an even earlier riser than me. So you may recall those you'd listen to episode 67.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.970
We talked about oh wait, what's new with me? Nothing.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.250
Back on the show

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.910
we did a little role playing not that kind of role playing but Brent took on his former persona of a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.250
traditional test manager. Yep. And we had a discussion with Alan modern test manager and we stated our points we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.810
dug on each other a little bit and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.960
Generated some discussion at least among the three on the one of the three slack channel and on Twitter as well

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.520
Yeah, there was a lot of I mean a lot more than usual activity on on Twitter when we post a new episode

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.180
You know, it's not uncommon to have several people

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.720
Retweet the announcement. No, it's all good. I absolutely love the feedback

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.370
for me the the slack channels become a just a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.890
Fantastic resource for the production of the episodes

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.350
Yeah, it definitely is a way for us to make sure it's way to connect with our fans

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.110
No, it's a way for

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.230
Brett and I to figure out what people like and what people don't like and one thing

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.830
Where we were confusing

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.630
Where we were extra confusing and where we just plain sounded stupid a couple things

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.790
I learned that I mentioned this on the last episode and worth bringing up again is

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.430
One revelation I had at the end of maybe in the middle of our recording

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.750
I thought about a lot since then and I don't have an answer yet, but I'll bring it up is

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:18.460
Coming up with a better elevator pitch on just what the heck I do and and and the value of a modern test manager and how and

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.580
expressing the value of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.780
what I do to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.500
connect testers and set vision and strategy and build my community of quality and testing expert to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.940
accelerate the achievement of shippable quality

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.240
It's visible to those I work with I think if not, I definitely work harder on it

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.080
but in explaining it to someone off the street, it's a

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.670
Little bit more difficult when so much of the value I bring

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.430
Maybe not as much as I think of but I think a lot of value I bring is

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.710
intangible sort of that player on the team who tries to make people around him better, but I

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.150
Bet there are some tangible things too. I'm just not this don't come consciously to mind

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.430
it even within the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.390
Definition that we talk about if our job is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.110
Right. How do you measure acceleration? Spenometer?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Is there a?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.760
Unity developed a test speedometer. No

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.080
That's the interesting thing. So what do you?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.000
What are saying that this is rhetorical because I don't know the answers

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.820
But what are some things that you can measure to tell if you're accelerating and I actually I think this is

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.140
Going back to Doug Hubbard how to measure anything. I think it's a measurable thing, but it's

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.260
It would take some time and experiments figure out which things are the right things and which things could are

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.180
more or less likely to be gamed, but

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.330
It's you can

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.170
Maybe even before you have the tangible measurements on that you certainly can

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.270
Feel that it's apparent that we're accelerating the ship the shipment of achievable quality

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.790
Which is a whole new thing. Yeah

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.230
Accelerating

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.470
quality you can tell when that's happening on the team if you you see things happening, but

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.990
It'll take me all come up with to come up with and to figure out if I need to measure specific things for that

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.870
Well, first off, I think you do

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.750
you as

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.910
the director of the the QA organization you are

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.670
somewhat accountable for the business of QA and

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.890
Here I literally mean the business side of it the ROI

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.630
Yeah, we we've we've talked about this before shot

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.150
QA is in most organizations perceived as a cost

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.950
Yes, right. Yes, and it's definitely more on that later in the episode. Yeah a deep dive

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.260
I'm thinking through things like like if we're an accelerant and our goal is to accelerate quality

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.620
Then in today's world, I think about Lytle's law

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.650
Yeah, I don't think I know Lytle's law is Lytle. How does it felt? LIDLE? I think

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.450
it may be little slaw I think it's spelled exactly the same as as

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.650
Little all right, but it's okay. It's it's one of the ways you measure the

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.490
productivity of a of a Kanban team, okay, and

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.420
you a

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.420
mature Kanban team over time

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.320
Their work ends up being roughly same sized

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.640
It is just a phenomenon that ends up

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.270
happening and

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.630
As you tighten and tighten your work gets smaller and smaller and then all you're doing is you're measuring

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.310
The rate at which you start new items. Ah

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.920
Interesting

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.110
Kanban

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.590
Right if this is only in a pure Kanban system where you have whip on

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.050
I don't want to get today's on an agile episode I think

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.890
Thinking we know what our episodes are about right?

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.350
I've learned what they're about as I'm editing and getting ready to post gotcha

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.590
So there's in a Kanban board you have this thing called whip which stands for work in progress

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.750
And it's a limit on how many items are allowed to be in that column at any given time

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.510
It sort of forces you to not

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.230
forces your team to not

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.930
multitask

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.930
Lidle's law is

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.010
essentially how they figure out

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.750
When you when you go to a restaurant and they have a wait time

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.070
Have you ever wondered how they figure it out how long the wait is?

00:07:53.630 --> 00:08:00.330
That gives so much complexity you got shifts you get you got chefs you may have two you may have three

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.850
They have a but after a while they learn that they know no, it's actually really easy

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:11.330
All you have to measure is the time delta between when you sit people down

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.000
So that yeah, that doesn't make any sense. So Kanban when you have no no go back go back to the restaurant

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.760
So okay, what I think you maybe missed a word in there

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.640
When so, let's say I get to the restaurant and they tell me it's a 20 minute wait for a table. When do they have?

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.630
When do they have wait times?

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.590
When there are too many customers for the tables to have available

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.780
Correct so that everyone inside the restaurant the restaurant

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:48.740
10 tables their their whip is 10 right perfect. So what they do

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.810
when they seat a

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:59.480
Person that means capacity is opened up, right when they seat a person

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.260
When they seat a family or a bunch of visitors, they're seating them because a capacity is opened up

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.300
What they do is they measure the time Delta

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.670
Between when they last sat somebody. Oh, so if it took them if the

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.830
Person in front of me took 20 minutes to get their table, then I'm gonna take 20 minutes

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.150
roughly, yeah, okay that and then as they as they I

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.310
Guess that works on on average, but let's say I have

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.350
10 tables and I had five people come in all at five o'clock cuz they wanted to have dinner early

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.830
Mm-hmm

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.230
They all got there together and then I had people trickle in over the next

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.970
Over the next hour and they all take varying times to finish

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.710
If those still is five people that got there early all finished at the same time

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.790
And there's a brief period where the wait time is very is accelerated

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.400
So the whip opened wide up

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.600
Over time it spaces out

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.700
But there are moments of burst. Okay, you can I wreck hold on

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:14.000
I wreck I wreck man just pointing out that although I agree that it over time and on average that will work

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.520
It's it's a fallible heuristic. I would call it a heuristic rather than a law because it is fallible

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.520
So no

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.560
I will leave it

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:33.180
Again, and I'm too tired to go into the math. I will just say it is an estimator

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.840
For those who understand the Poisson distribution

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:43.340
the value that you're gonna select based off of the history is what's known as the

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:51.180
Expected value, but it follows the distribution. So it's always going to be if you wanted the waitress to be precise

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:58.040
You would ask her for what's known as the expected value plus the confidence interval and then she's gonna spit in my food

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.620
Probably she's gonna look at you go. What's a confident confidence interval sir?

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:10.700
The no actually the good that where restaurants I go they fire back and say it'll be 17 minutes and 30 seconds

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.490
Well, then 80% confidence rate and then I kiss her on the lips when my wife punches me

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.380
Trying to wind this back to whatever the hell we were talking about before

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:29.160
Silly man, so like a simple way to apply a measure here would be to measure

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.140
apply land of light of law

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.000
the main parameter for Poisson distribution is known as lambda and

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.100
What you're trying to observe is are

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.580
Are the things that you're doing number one?

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.940
positively changing lambda mean which would be a measurement of

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.940
acceleration

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.460
Alan's smiling am I going way too geeky on this one? He is but I think

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.220
What's a baby sheep called a lamb? Duh? Oh

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:14.480
Man and but then the other thing is in agile particularly in in

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.880
Kanban one of the the principles

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.600
is

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.680
Optimize the whole right so you don't want to just measure how fast your team is

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800
efficiently starting new work

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.040
You also want to measure as they ship it

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:39.100
Are we delivering positive or negative results so you need a measure of quality in some regard sir?

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.300
I'm actually working on a similar problem today is

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.040
This is a common corporate problem where you want to know

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:54.140
Hey is the is support is our support process in general

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.380
creating happier or unhappier customers

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.820
Probably next week. I have several different things. I'm going to try to see if there's a correlation

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.630
because the

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:15.700
What we're trying to do is get online a bunch of self-help assets and we want to know okay

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.780
so we can measure whether or not self-help is actually

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:26.420
Causing people to not have to go through the manual process and contact our support team

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.230
but how do we know is it improving sentiment or

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.230
not

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.880
so gonna start looking for correlations between common pain signals like

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.100
Do they leave the company do they reduce their usage?

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.080
Don't want to have to resort to surveys surveys are the lowest form of quality data

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:56.040
Yeah, how do we get here? Can we go back you asked?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.800
You spoke how do we measure? Yeah, whether or not we're accelerating the achievement of shippable quality

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.040
Well, you know you need a you need a metric around acceleration

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.440
you need a metric around quality that you are constantly looking at and

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.200
distrusting to a point

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.480
That's forcing you to improve the metric. Okay. I want to go a little

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.180
deeper into some of that discussion, but I think we can just set it up with a mailbag question from the

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.400
from

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:34.320
The slack channel. Okay, and then from there. I have an article came out recently. I'd like to discuss with you. Okay

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.800
That's the plan here. So

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.120
mailbag

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.770
It's been a while since we had a mailbag so

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.490
There was a nice discussion around the role of the modern tester

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:55.870
And then there was a discussion leading up to this that maybe we'll go back to but I'll go ahead and read the the mailbag question

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:03.770
Salty says just last week. I heard a developer complaining about how the company was not supporting them because it was

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.730
Removing a quote testing resource. So they were having to do more testing

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:16.980
It seems like I'm not QA mindset and the testing is for load paid grunts mindset can be very much alive still

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.860
So how do we go about changing that mindset?

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.620
How do we show the developers that there is value to them in doing their own testing?

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.860
So it reminded me of I want to jump in here first. I have a story

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:37.660
I'm sure I've mentioned a long long time ago, but I worked on Windows CE from when from night

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.860
No about 2000 the 2004 2005

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.980
Which was an embedded version of Windows a real embedded version like super small

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.780
it could you could boot a OS with a web server and and and camera drivers off of a

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.180
1.44 inch floppy which some of our listeners can't even remember what those look like

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.300
But very small OS. So anyway, I worked on this very small OS I helped

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:10.340
Transition and teach that team to write unit tests for their code. This is back in this time

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:16.340
Believe it or not. There are many many teams. In fact, most teams at Microsoft did not even write unit tests

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.540
That was the testers job. I

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.300
helped I got the team writing unit tests and

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:30.060
Many developers came to me privately and asked this is just unit tests. I said hey if we're writing unit tests

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.180
What is the test team gonna do and?

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.950
There's a worst part of this story

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.430
Someone who hadn't seen the light yet

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:42.350
Obviously came to me a tester came to me and said hey if the developers writing unit tests, what are we gonna do?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.540
Which is a different I could solve that problem a little bit differently

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:52.020
but what we did at the time is just show value in all the other kinds of

00:16:53.570 --> 00:17:00.890
Testing work and quality work we could do the story shift a little bit, but it's the same answer my short answer for

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.730
the question is

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:11.260
Show value in all the other ways we can improve and accelerate quality in the product

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:16.400
And there's a laundry list of those which we can go through in a little bit, but I'll let you

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:24.040
Elaborate on your answer first. I think there's multiple answers to this question. No, there can be only one

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.790
No, I mean the the

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.350
So I've helped I think now

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.780
There's at least three teams that I've helped go through this this chain

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.600
and I've heard every

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:49.400
Possible I think I've heard every possible pushback from dev the one sad thing about

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.830
test is

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.870
Test sometimes by their words and definitely by their actions

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.300
over and over and over again

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.820
Proves that we are load-paid grunts. I

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.460
Didn't bring this up I should have I like a

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.300
There's a whole bunch of other things that we could have discussed in the modern versus tradition. Oh, yeah

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.660
This is discussion that was missed but one of the things

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:28.130
That that test in the old school really added value to the org

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.220
Was by being the organizationals the organization's scapegoat

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.560
We were the ones

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.360
That I think of a slide deck I saw from Alan a while ago

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:49.040
Where tests were the the people following the elephants in the parade? Yeah, I have the sequence of slides

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.000
I've shown in a few different talks. It show we are the champions of quality. I showed some superheroes and

00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.040
We are the gatekeepers that shows like some video game. They're guarding the gate. I say, you know, who else?

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.960
Guards make sure that everything is cleaned up to the end

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:10.280
I show these guys shoveling crap in a parade of just piles of horse what and no no

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.720
Organization would ever

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.040
Explicitly do this, but I've I've often just paid attention to

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.440
How are things treated? What are the actions that support the words?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.960
And the reality is is that a lot of tests their role is is really to be the scapegoat for the organization

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.120
That's that's why dev values test in this role

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:40.700
If if something gets past me, I don't have to be accountable. I can blame test that's that's why

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.160
one of the questions in the old school that

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.340
That was important for a lead was to say to be able to

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:58.300
Smartly answer why wasn't this found before? Mm-hmm because that that question comes up all the time

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.660
the accountability

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:06.700
test enables the accountability for dev for the quality of their code to

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:15.030
Go downstream, but who wouldn't want that I could write I could do whatever I want and I can blame someone else. That's fantastic

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.420
Right now

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.860
That's one of the challenges you're gonna work against

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.900
In in this world now what I did and an Allen story is a little bit different

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.580
What I did is I joined dev

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.710
right, yeah, right I I joined dev I

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.390
created a team that was a mix of dev and test and

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:46.910
Quite honestly, I kicked ass because I understood how the system actually worked

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:54.560
I understood what our goals were which was velocity and quality and I understood that bug slowed me down

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.470
Now I was very well

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.070
noticed as

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.070
doing things differently

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.220
very differently

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.520
But the results that I delivered

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.260
was also

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.340
very well noticed I

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.840
Wrote an article reminds me that I still point people to

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:22.540
It's 10 years old but called the one that got away. It's up on sticky minds. Okay about the same thing like

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.980
It's a true story. I didn't didn't even change the names

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.340
Nobody knows them. Did you claim that you change the names? I know oh

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.500
but

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.840
The story was about they released a product customer had a bug

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:44.820
They complained about it our dev director got really pissed off and and and yelled at my boss and I I was

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.140
Again, I've spent most my career sort of the technical assistant the test directors

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.000
paraphrase the article you can go read the damn thing but

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:58.500
It talks about this culture of blame and how to kind of get out of it and make sure it's a it's about

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.140
Understanding when you make mistakes, it's about learning and understanding

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:08.020
Obviously, you don't want to make bad ones that cost millions of dollars, but people have and they've learned from them

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:14.780
There's plenty of anecdotes and stories around that I have not and maybe you have Alan. I have not found

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.120
In terms of the problem of hey

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:23.680
What is test gonna do the regardless of who comes to it or or as the salty gunner asked?

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.920
You know, how do we influence dev on this front?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.000
I think it has to be through action and showing value and and data where it matters

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.560
I haven't that's what I was to say. I have not found a way of doing it

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.470
Via words and philosophizing. Absolutely not

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.200
Now and so there in is this is a catch-22

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:53.920
Right because if you if if you need approval in order to try and you need to try in order to prove

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.580
You're in a loop now what I've done in the past is I've gone dark I

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:07.310
As a manager, I would keep one or two resources my back pocket hide them from my schedules

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.310
And then I would just call them resources

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:17.270
That traditional test manager coming out there perhaps or just tired Brent it's maybe a little both I

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.350
had kick-ass employees

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:28.130
Resources in my mind actually to do a feeble backtrack I was thinking about

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.530
Capacity on on my team not necessarily actually people but

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.930
Essentially available work hours. That's alright

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:45.420
But I would I would not use them all up and I would use them on on sort of these proof projects

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.640
It's actually one of the ways that I helped

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:57.960
Get agile I did my part to get agile into the company there was multiple different people back in the day. I remember

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:04.520
Back when you were right driving Q tech you asked me to come sit on a panel for agile. Mm-hmm. That was very

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:11.280
Early on in Microsoft. I don't even call it adoption because Microsoft still hasn't adopted agile wholeheartedly

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.440
There's us. It's a lot better than it was back in those days

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:23.200
But there was certainly certainly there was a lot of questions from the audience were were really concerned about risk and and

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.160
You knew they well, how do we prove this to management? I'm like look

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:34.500
Any sort of change like this humans by nature are are resistant to change

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:40.820
We know how to make it work in this model. Yeah, it's not optimal, but we know how to make it work

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.900
and the way you

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:51.380
Break through that is you have to carve off and and I always frame it as tell you what I'm gonna carve off some of my

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.380
people

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.910
And I'm going to do a pilot

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.340
I'll take two people do a pilot for for three months and I'll report back

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.740
And I think you can go much much smaller than that it can be

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.580
Just a couple little things you do here and here and there

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.700
It doesn't have to be people carved off for three months

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:17.820
It can be part of a person for a few weeks just to start showing. Oh what you did that?

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.300
That's that's cool. Let's do more of that

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.780
So I I don't want to scare anyone to thinking it has to be even that big of an investment

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.820
but I do think that

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:35.580
You need to experiment and pilot and do things in little chunks even if you're not given permission I

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.110
have I

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:44.150
Have blogged around my experience. So I don't want to spend all of our podcast going through it again

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.680
The the most important thing that

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.480
That I did from a leadership point of view is I said, all right

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.790
Tell you what? I'm gonna run my own dev team and I'll do it with testers and

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:07.940
I've done this repeatedly the last team I left I helped I started started off that process

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.500
The guy that's now running it

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:16.020
It was a former test manager and he's known for being one of the strongest engineering teams now

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:22.760
and but he had to deal with six months of being put down even in that role because

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.070
He was just a former test manager pretending to be dev

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.170
Yeah, and he doesn't hear that anymore at all

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.820
Anyway, I was anything else practical we could

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.920
suggest on this one

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.610
Like you can't use words. It's gonna be context-sensitive

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:49.510
That's the best the main point you can't and this is a common failure across a lot of changes and we've and

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.740
without

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.900
Actually specifically avoiding a deep dive into how to do organizational change

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.780
Which I'm sure we've talked about before as well

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.430
Is

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.850
You just you need to show

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.830
Examples and people will recognize it and you need to look for

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.030
one thing

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.470
Michael Lop on

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:16.630
Ranz and her pose blog one thing he does and I do as well as what's called a trickle list

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.590
This is not stuff that goes on my combine board because not stuff that ever gets done

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.950
But it's stuff I need to do

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.820
consistently

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.820
One of the and it can be things like

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:33.020
Meet with dev dev directors and managers. It's like I don't have specific meetings

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.440
But I make sure that like once or twice a week

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:41.020
I take some time to do a drive-by or a slack chat and check in for 10 or 15 minutes things

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.820
I need to do continuously and if I don't do for a while

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:49.180
I need to notice one of the things may be on there is like show value from

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.180
QA there's some good things happening

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:58.260
I haven't shared to show to show the value of like some tools some process some

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.260
Data that represents how we are accelerating the achievement of quality

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.460
If I am going to convince people of or I feel like I need to convince people of that value

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:14.820
I need to make sure I find things to share frequently and if I'm not finding things to share

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.840
Make sure that I'm thinking about that as well. I would

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:25.340
Just think rethinking the answer piggybacking off of what you just said. There's another cash 22

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.340
How do you convince management to do this?

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.820
Right, whatever you do if you're gonna start with words

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.420
You're gonna have to align it to something that the business is concerned with

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.460
nowadays

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.020
Speed is something quality is another

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.620
Thing there's actually a list the big seven

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.640
Things for a business and it'll be like growth revenue

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.000
profit

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.120
efficiency blah blah blah you can look it up the

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:58.780
Critical thing I think that that were I in that role today. I would say okay

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:06.170
I would talk to to my executives and I say look this is what I'm gonna do you have all of these resources and

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.240
It only takes a few seconds to realize that

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.680
It is no longer the best practice

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:21.420
If you don't trust me there are I mean this is not like it was Microsoft ten years ago where there was

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.060
so many companies

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:30.100
There were so few companies that that had taken the risk and moved to agile now

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.260
It's all over you don't have you don't have to do these arguments like I did back in the day

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.590
Yeah, but I don't know if as many of

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.150
Again, I don't spend so much time trying to convince

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.950
Those above me that what I'm doing is the right thing. I just do

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.850
And and and later they go oh, yeah, of course you're doing the right

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:49.810
I think that's still better

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:56.130
But I'm trying to come up with what would be my best verbal argument on this one and if I were in your raw

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:00.890
I'd say here's this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take a portion of my resources and

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:07.930
What I'm going to do is I'm gonna have them spend their time not on doing unit testing

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:16.040
But making it friction free for dev to do their own unit testing. Yeah, and that's accelerating the right

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.600
I'm going I'm going to make it easier and easier for dev to do that's exactly

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:29.080
And that is exactly what I'd rather have my team do than write those tests themselves. The second thing I'm going to do is

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.780
I'm gonna do hands-on

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.460
Coaching and I'm gonna I'm gonna boost up

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:44.160
The the skill sets of your dev team the third thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna boost up the development skills of your test team

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.310
so I'm gonna convert your developers into

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:57.040
Specializing generalists and I'm gonna convert your testers and do specializing generalists. I'm gonna come after it a different way and

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.680
I'm gonna take point on

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.760
Leading the test side of the house as an engineering team. Let's start talking about what features my team works on

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.760
This is an example of giving people what they need versus what they want

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.360
Which is another great leadership and change organization skill if your manager were to come to you and say okay

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.920
You need to I need your team to give me test plans and write tests write all the tests of the dev team can get

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.920
Work on their features. I hear what you're saying. I

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.920
Understand we need to have tests make sure everything's done

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.560
I think I'm gonna try something a little different and I and here's why it's gonna work and then go into your thing

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.600
Right and then they get with it and they go. Oh, then you go and you go kid

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.740
Let's just do it for a week. I'm gonna have this

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:44.080
Target group one one feature teams gonna do it that way and let's just see how it goes if my way fails

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.520
If my way fails, we'll go back and do it your way, but I think it's gonna be better in the long run

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.200
You've hired me to be your manager for this QA team. I I

00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:00.480
And to own quality air quote. I think this will work and of course all listeners go

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.520
Well, of course it'll work dub, but but you but again pointing here bosses

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.760
Brent and I included sometimes have to I think we're a little more open than most but you know what I get people they're like

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.440
This is the way I've always done it. Let me show you a different way now and

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.640
Really when they say this is the way I've always done it

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:24.330
Right. What's the value in that statement? It's it's like I know this way is of no risk

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.360
right, so just realize that what you're what you're representing is is is

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.040
Some risk to them and you do just got to be proactive in communicating

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.040
Now that's when you talk with executives when you talk with dev

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.640
you're gonna have to do it a different angle because again, they value you as

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.320
the person they blame later

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.680
Mm-hmm right back to that codependency. We've talked about great good discussion

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.200
I want to tie that into something again was shared on our slack group and an article from

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.360
Penaya called the 2017 state of functional testing report

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.880
Which I've read a couple times now highlighted a few things. I just want to kind of bring it up in

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.160
context of this traditional versus modern

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:19.490
Discussion Brent's taking it from me. No, I I did not bring my own copy

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.200
So I want to share

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.240
So I'm not gonna read the whole thing

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.520
It's a survey of people at 150 companies I think largely

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:37.720
IT shops versus people shipping software to customers, but maybe actually maybe a combination

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.280
Based based on the answers, but I both think that makes a relevant difference

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.640
Maybe it doesn't I don't know how they chose the companies

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.560
I thought the the insights were both telling and

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.920
some good some

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:59.280
WTF but a few points I wanted to bring up some that are interesting and reflective of just

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.640
Testing as we've been talking about in general and some that reflect on this

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.840
modern versus traditional argument, so I I scan the art the article and

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.920
I

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.760
do think

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:17.420
It's a fantastic piece of work is it's one of those things you definitely need to read with a

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.440
a critical eye and apply your own

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:29.200
Don't take everything at face value read and see what and try and read the intent behind what was there

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.320
but I definitely think this this

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.760
document in an abstract is

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:42.390
Saying that the stuff that we've been talking about a what's coming next for test is in fact what's coming next for test

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:48.170
All right. I'm gonna go through some things. I I circled and just get your comment on them

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:53.010
It's going to be a little disjointed because it has like a section then a recap then a section then a recap

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.340
And then I think it's a little overwritten

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.450
Like someone took a little bit white papers of the source

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:09.650
Yeah, so here's the first thing I circled is test automation is coveted by all but still too costly

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.210
Even for regression testing to implement without risk

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.270
Agree coveted by all

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.570
All except except a few people

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:28.070
No, no test automate. I mean we have as a whole and test we haven't moved out of the world where where

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.880
Test automation isn't the holy grail like and

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.520
Large companies like having an automated test suite and automated integration suite is the only way to scale. Yeah. No, I know

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.520
I say it's right but the costly regression

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:48.960
I mean what the problem is is that there isn't a lot of intelligence around test selection like if

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:56.160
Some of the comments on the slack channel regarding the last episode around how can test start getting into ML

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.520
Test selection is absolutely an obvious

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.880
ML problem. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and we should deep dive into that later

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.400
But just a sentence later in the same paragraph something very cool

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:15.520
It is expected by 31 percent of participants that QA and developers roles will eventually merge

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:23.520
Yeah, and that is I love that because I think for everyone who sees that that's the path there are at this stage

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.280
Anecdotally even on Twitter which people actually pay attention to testing much less

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.220
So it's interesting that executives definitely see that that move happening

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.160
I don't think 31% of testers or developers or managers overall in the industry

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.970
See that yet

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:44.510
No, but and anyone some will dig in their heels and fight it

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:52.510
No, we must have our separate discipline to make sure that we are the checks and balances and gatekeepers for quality

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:59.190
And it really what they are doing is their their risk adverse and

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:05.270
Going on here again. These are a lot of things we're going to agree with some and if you'll get there'll be a few WTFs

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:11.950
In there, but so 31% like I would I would say like 10 years ago. That would probably have been like 3%

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:17.550
Yes, yes, right. I definitely think that's on the rise and how about this and the question is is wins the tipping point

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:23.630
I bet you soon. I bet it's within the next three years that it I think it is over. I think it is almost half

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:30.710
47% of IT leaders surveyed believe that their tests do not accurately reflect real-life production

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:37.470
Scenarios. Yep, and that number is down because I think ten years ago people thought like 90%

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:41.430
Yeah, we have our int environment, which is an exact replication of production

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:46.110
People are getting it. They go. Oh, yeah, whatever we do internally. It doesn't match the real world

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.390
I had a conversation with a dev manager here like

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:56.310
This is why the testing and production stuff we talked about is way more critical when you ship

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.710
when you ship a product and you test it in a clean room environment and

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:07.710
Then you realize when you shipped it to prod it performs entirely different and the main reason why is when you go to prod

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.310
It's exactly clean for a microsecond. Yes

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:17.230
Because during the Coase life is going to be living in a dirty dirty dirty world

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:21.230
if you'd like us to elaborate and give you a hundred examples of

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:27.910
The same sort of thing and what things fail in production that work just fine up until then we can do a whole episode

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.910
Just sharing stories. Yeah

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:37.990
Moving on in fact when asked about their top test execution challenges most testing leaders reported tools that are

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:41.310
Unfriendly to non-technical testers. Yep

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:47.260
So I I pushed my button because of the non technical tester reference

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:54.240
But I guess they exist or they maybe not maybe they're labeled that but they're not really if

00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:00.610
You want to leverage manual labor like technical people are expensive

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:07.970
Like the route that you're talking about is like look I would rather have one high paid tester on my team than ten load paid ones

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:12.610
Right. Well these guys are they're saying we want to do the opposite strategy. That's fine

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.530
I'm gonna fly through a few more quotes for you

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:20.050
This one is I'm worried that the number so low two out of three testing leaders surveyed

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:25.370
Stated that QA and testing initiatives are highly important to their organization's overall strategy

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:35.140
There's my WTF like uh, what wouldn't it be more? What about that third? They don't think it's highly important

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.300
I thought it was extremely important. I didn't read that one. I I

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.220
That's in the testing is no longer an afterthought section. Oh

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:50.350
Okay, cuz I I hear that stat with the cynical eye. Yeah, I'm like wait

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:57.810
The testing leader has told you that his QA initiatives are important to the business. Call me shocked. Yeah

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:03.770
Well, I read it as two-thirds really at also in the not surprising category

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.950
as I said as could be expected test automation is not everyone's wish list as

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:15.150
47% of test leaders predict that continuous delivery and agile adoption will lead to test automation for the majority of tests

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:18.030
Yeah, yeah

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:25.630
There's a section that says business and IT must converge and this is part of I think acceleration and and I

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.230
Think this is a critical section

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:30.750
If it's a section that I think they're talking about

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:37.230
It is about connecting business requirements business understanding with the testing effort

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:43.200
Yes that actually my summation of this section is it is it's

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.240
describing the need

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.560
for

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.360
modern testers

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:55.630
To directly associate their work to business business level

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.020
outcomes

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:04.780
Yeah, this is a section that it's overwhelming that creating a better customer experience is critical for for QA and testing

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:12.260
Yes enabling continuous delivery. This is a it is it is not our job to get to a hundred percent pass rate

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.300
No, it is our job

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.540
to

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.380
Grow CSAT or customer satisfaction by 6%

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:23.300
Yeah, I wrote in this my notes on this page of the article is all around

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.220
Accelerating. Yeah

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:32.940
Again, this is a section that says the test that did not accurately reflect real-life production scenarios at the regression suite is

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.460
Hard to create and maintain

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.420
One of the comments that came back in lower percentage was not enough developers for test automation

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.940
Which again without having some context around that may not know what they mean

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.340
So I'm not gonna comment too deeply on that. It's more of an investment

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:54.180
And again coming back to automation is too costly. I think I think the not enough developers thing for test automation

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.960
kind of reminds me of like sort of the

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.220
The old-school s-tet problem we had all the time. How do we?

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.100
Take some rockstar coders and

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.860
Seduce them into an s-tet role instead of a dev role. Mm-hmm

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:15.100
I think I think that will change over time because I do firmly think it's a mistake

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.140
And I think a couple things happen to one is that as we mentioned just a minute ago

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:26.240
That it gets easier and easier. Maybe we're already there. It's easy to write tests now. There are testing frameworks for

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.180
all over the place it's

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.600
Some set of tests and I think we'll begin to apply as we mentioned before

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:40.780
Machine learning and some and some computer generated tests to help cover additional testing. Yeah, and not just based on the code but based on

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.760
Customer patterns and tying those all together. I think in the next 10 years

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.920
I think ML is gonna do most of the testing quite honestly

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.730
the last section is on the

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:58.590
Untapped potential on test management and automation and overall there's again. There's a few

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.890
WTF moments. There's a revealing graph. I wrote yuck shows it

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:10.430
54% among these people surveyed of their functional testing is done manually. What's the point they're trying to make?

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:15.250
like 54% doesn't surprise me but

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:20.600
That seems quite high to me. Has it gone down? Is it going? That's the thing

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.760
I I bet that still improved from where it was a few years ago

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.640
Where we're at now the state of the Union is not where I think it should be. I

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.180
Know I agree, but I think the point of this argument is is essentially

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.500
Testing is undergoing a worldwide transformation

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:42.910
Yes. Yes, and it's clear. It's interesting because we're in some silos of

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.790
even you with within a company of

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:52.150
Teams that are they get it and they're advanced and they're trying to even move even faster

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.790
but you know for just from conversations on Twitter and

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:59.850
Reading articles on the internet a lot of there are many many more that just don't get it

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:02.690
so what I like in reading this article is that

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:10.620
We're seeing that there are more people who actually get it than I kind of thought there were which is good

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:15.900
We're reaching that tipping point where where the traditional tester the traditional test model is

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.540
Going to start fading more rapidly it is and we've explained this right?

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.940
it's because the the the business landscape has changed and

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:35.560
Where companies realize that they have all of these resources on testing that aren't necessarily needed

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:38.750
sticking to the old model

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.390
Is a Darwinistic risk?

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:49.340
Meaning yeah, right. Yeah, and then I'm gonna still part of one paragraph which reflects some of our discussion

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:56.140
Test cases based on business knowledge of the relevant cases to automate is the way forward say yeah

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:04.440
So there's some pretty good insight in here. Normally. I hate these survey based. This is confirmation bias

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:12.300
I may be because normally I hate these survey based articles, but this one there's a few like head knotters in here

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.200
It's I'll put a link up to you have to it's one of those places

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.560
One of those reports where you give that to give them their email address to get the report

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.840
Ball put a link up for it if you want to check it out yourself like I said it's a little

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.560
overwritten and a little

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.440
bombastic

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.600
but

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.120
Still I think an interesting read and worth

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:38.160
Maybe use your throwaway email address you all have one if you don't you gotta have that throw away

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:43.160
You just sign up for shit with right right if you don't have one then just go to you know

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.320
Google and create another one. Yeah, I recommend Google for that one so that

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.640
Microsoft doesn't have to pay for everybody's crappy

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.460
Advertisements only email addresses

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:01.110
Anyway, I think that I think the nutshell on this one is yeah, this is an interesting doc

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.270
I would not hold it as you know the holy truth

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:11.790
nothing in fact nothing you read or hear should you ever hold us the holy truth, but I

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.380
I

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:18.400
Would take it seriously, and I think I like it and again

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.500
This is confirmation bias flying through and I recognize that it's that double comfort. I'm confirming confirmation bias what happens there

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.380
I think I just exploded

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.720
You're running late for a meeting but it proves to me that

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:37.660
the direction that we see and the direction that many of our listeners see is I

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:44.380
Get some validation in that because I think it's not just me in my little world and in fact I meet people who go well

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:51.060
I'm in QA, but it's not like everyone else's QA then we have a discussion go. Oh, yeah, we're on the same page

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:57.260
Welcome welcome to the world. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and I've seen that more and more and it's kind of fantastic. I

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:05.350
I see the dots connecting. I do think that there's a risk of confirmation bias. I wouldn't use this I

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.150
Would I use this as hey?

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.980
this survey seems to see a

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:18.220
Similar future as to what I see and it does

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.020
sort of

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.990
See a similar timeline, I think yep, and the future so bright we got to wear shades

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.700
Yeah, and less you know you can

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:37.320
You're holding on with white knuckles to 1990s. Yeah, and there are those out there

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.860
No time to dig into today, but I read another article

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:48.540
Recently of for it seems like every one of these I read we just talked about there's another two articles of people holding on tight

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.020
to

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.400
traditional testing

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.880
Yeah, it's I've been in both I

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.800
Think the biggest problem is when when people are having these polarized arguments

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:07.160
They really from where they stand they really can't see where the other person is coming from absolutely

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.200
I've been in both that last week, and I I

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.770
I remember the first day

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:21.970
I was doing the Kanban, and I'm like shipping things in small little packets that seems so odd to me

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:28.130
But then the first day I shipped something and I brought the product on the floor. I'm like oh my god

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:31.480
All I have to do is spend 15 minutes and revert this

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:39.600
Whereas every other time in the old-school world it was weeks of trying to figure out what the hell the problem was

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.560
Yeah, yeah, it's a good world. It is all right. I'm gonna book out of here

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:50.110
And I'm not and I'm not Brent. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. See ya
