00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.320
The modern testing podcast join your hosts Alan and Brent I am mindless agile

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.550
robot I must iterate as we talk about software engineering software quality

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.340
leadership and whatever else comes to mind now on with the show good morning

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.710
Brent good morning Alan it's been a while since we've been together been a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.220
month was reunited I'm not gonna sing on you that's a bad idea bad bad bad I know how you been?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.960
yeah now I got that song in my head I know you do how you been I'll tell you how you been

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.800
yeah you're wearing one shoe today tell me a story I broke my foot last Sunday and how

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:10.160
bad did the other guy did it? the the brick is just fine so the story I tell people the punch line is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.080
is I broke my foot by sitting and what happened is I was sitting cross-legged on my front patio

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:27.370
unbeknownst to me I had put my foot to sleep and it was time for me to get up to go do something

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.450
and in the process of getting up and walking I had failed to notice that my foot was paralyzed

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.250
right the the tingling hadn't started to make it a clear sign that oh there's something problem

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:50.250
so I started walking failed lost balance attempted to adjust my balance by shifting my foot sideways

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.340
straight on an edge of a brick which broke I don't know if you've ever seen an x-ray of a foot

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.710
but your your foot when you look at an x-ray the bones look very much like a hand where the little

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.710
tips of them end up being your toes and doesn't work very well on a podcast

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.670
brent brent's pointing to his hand right now but I essentially broke this knuckle

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.840
so you can think of it as as um the bone as it extends into the big part or the big bone on your

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:36.100
foot the pinky toe bone reaches into a knuckle and it's that knuckle I broke so you're a deuces I am

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:46.420
it made a very concrete noise I remember in mid-flight I heard the noise and I said

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.020
very quickly oh my god that's going to be a problem but first I need to make sure I do not fall over

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.390
because after I hit that brick I lost my balance again and started tilting the other way and almost

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:12.330
landed in a bunch of um bushes I successfully blocked that fall my son asks uh hey why don't

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.850
you just put your hand out and just stop the fall and I said oh because I had my phone in my hand and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:28.700
I was also trying to protect my phone so it is you are an idiot on so many levels I'm not sure

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.180
which one to make fun of the most so first off when you are uh in a situation like that it

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.740
is all muscle memory there's no conscious thought no I would have I would have superhero

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:50.550
rolled out of it all right then I'm just overall your muscle memory I mean I uh is that thing I've

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.470
told you before I'm a black belt and take one though I've done superhero roles multiple times

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.880
yeah how did those help you in this situation it did not good protect my phone crack and the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:13.240
I guess on that front I have I have destroyed many a brick with with uh in karate with with hands

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.560
and feet but this time the brick one so this was brick revenge it might have been and I just just

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.370
a quick question do you just have bricks randomly laying around your yard no this was uh edging

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.140
you can imagine yeah sidewalk and I hit it that master of coordination ladies and gentlemen

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:42.680
brain jensen yeah a b test how long where the empathy so at least you don't have like a big

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.160
old cast on you have like a foot uh what's it called a not even a boot you have a you have a

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.720
wrapper around your foot this is how long do you wear that uh another three to seven weeks

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.200
okay what do you do when you go to put a shoe back on and uh your shoes are worn unevenly

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:11.900
buy new shoes no you break the other foot to even it out no no that that does not happen

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.260
I don't have a cast I would like the three to put odds on that

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.540
given the story you just told given the time you know depending on the timeline like ever in my life

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.810
I won't take that bet but yeah and the bone is not castable that that particular break is not

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:36.460
castable so that's the reason why so what this this thing I'm wearing now what it does is it

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:47.340
adds support to my foot I can I have crutches out in my car I don't need them per se at least not

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:55.180
yet I can walk as long as I put the pressure on the inside of my foot not the outside where the

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:04.470
brake is so really the way to fix your foot is the same thing as the root cause of breaking your foot

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.530
you should sit more all right on yeah I don't know where I'm gonna go here

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.650
yeah welcome to episode 104 so we have a guest today don't we Brett yes yes we have

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.770
all the way from London England author of an upcoming book called leading quality

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:32.170
Ron Cummings John Ron welcome to the A B testing podcast hello it's so it's so lovely to be here

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.970
you guys are like the funniest pair talking all the time so yeah I'm excited about today

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:45.290
I'm I kind of feel sorry for you because we're not that funny no we've been accused of this

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.210
I know it's weird there is reminds me first tangent of the day I listen to this podcast

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.930
called tech talk y'all which is interesting because it's a good way for me to catch up on

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:04.250
the pop culture of tech but these guys describe themselves as a tech comedy podcast but they don't

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.250
tell any jokes they're not funny all they do is make a few funny voices once in a while and act

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:17.850
excited so compared to them we are funny so this is this is a testing comedy podcast you only you

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:25.030
keep the bar very low yes all right back back to our guest we are I'm excited to have you I have

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:31.270
read a preview of Ron's book and I have a bunch of questions out in front of me but first of all

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.030
just tell us a little bit about yourself Ron and and what you've been up to and what you do

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:45.430
and what kind of led you to writing this book yes so I am a co-founder of a crowd processing

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.910
company I've been working with my my co-founder a guy called always pissed about 11 years now

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:58.630
and we originally weren't from the tech or the the the testing well we were actually in the

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:04.230
process of building a search engine for beauty products and we got backed by our investors to

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:11.770
build that and as we were going about this process of building a search engine oh my goodness QA

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:19.290
and just dealing with quality was a nightmare and um I remember we went back to our investor one day

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:25.770
and said look I know finding the right beauty product is a problem but I mean I think that

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:32.360
the testing could be a bigger one and that's how we got into the space that I'm you know fast forward

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.720
five years we now work with some of the coolest tech companies in the world which is super fun

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.120
and and what that did is it gave us this opportunity to understand how do some of the top companies

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.080
the world like your faithless you google your your etch and all these guys how do they

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.280
how do they test how they look at tests and how does that differ from what we see from other companies

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.640
and so we came to get an ask this question by people you know what should my QA strategy be

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.440
and we we originally thought that we could we could work that out and write a book on it in about

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:12.650
six months little did we know it took us on a two and a half year journey of basically just

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:17.610
meets lots of people finding out you know the truth behind what really happens in company

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:23.370
and this led us to to complete a book which is uh the summer called living quality which really

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:31.110
the summary if I was to say to someone is really that we in the testing space need to ensure

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:39.400
that we elevate our conversation and are providing as much value to the business by focusing on what's

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.440
happening for our customers and the QA and quality and test teams there are many ways to do that

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.860
which is the kind of things that we end up talking about yeah I really like there's a quote

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.260
in the book which you just uh talked all the way around I'm going to read uh which is as we came

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.740
to the end of the book we realized that there was a much deeper question than what should my QA

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:05.020
strategy be the question was how can I better lead quality inside my company which aligns a lot with

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.780
we have these modern testing principles of course modern testing dot org check them out

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.460
and our fourth principle is we care deeply about the quality culture of the team and coach lead

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.740
and nurture this team towards a more mature quality culture the thing I like is how he just said

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:27.450
he basically said principle one in his synopsis of the book yes which is our priority is improving

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.170
the business and that's that's prevalent a lot that's uh I was as I was reading through your

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.570
book I was kind of oh okay that aligns with that principle that aligns with that principle so

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:45.990
congratulations on on agreeing with us so I I just privileged to have been on the same score

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:51.830
pattern yeah I was going to say um you said you thought you were going to pound out this book in

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:58.150
six months and I'm like in this particular community I'm not certain you could accurately define

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:05.450
testing in six months oh man you know what let me tell you let me show you what really happened

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.730
right yeah we wrote the first version of the book and um we gave it to a couple people and

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:16.730
they were like no because one thing that that you probably know about the testing community

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:22.410
is we love debate and arguing and the accuracy of everything that's that's said we test the idea

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:28.010
to its empty group so the first version of the book basically got destroyed um and then we wrote it

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:36.900
again and once again the level of uh questioning and justifying that has to happen before we could

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:43.350
get to a releasable state was um was emotional and character building

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:56.280
that which doesn't kill you right ron exactly so I guess the first question I I didn't

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.520
I didn't make uh the short list of the the pre-read um

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:09.720
um I actually thought that was on purpose I wanted I wanted Brent to come in

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.720
cold and kind of hear all this for the first time no so we call it a b testing and we tell people

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:22.360
it's because of Alan and Brent but uh you know a lot of the times it becomes clear and clear

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:31.080
it's the a team and the b team yeah uh anyway before we continue I Alan has

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.880
standing in front of him he has a long list of questions he wants to ask but the very first

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:48.460
question is potential questions that I may ask is sum up when you say leading quality can you sum

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:54.730
up the definition of quality in that case you know I feel like every time I talk to people

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.490
that's the first question that they want to ask so what do you mean by quality you know

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:09.210
and my continual answer is thank you for asking a loaded question um we it depends on how long you

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:14.330
would like to continue the debate for um but really you know I think that the term and the

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:21.050
word quality can be continued right because we we all get it right it's important everyone says

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:28.650
they care about it but it has quite a nebulous definition of of itself and when I think about

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:34.010
it I always say there's there's two facts that I guess everyone can agree on fact number one

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:39.930
is that quality is subjective which means determined by whoever using it at that point in time which

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:45.130
is obviously why the idea of making sure we're building things that customers care about is so

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:50.410
important and then the second thing is that is relative right the idea of what quality is

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:57.820
for you and I can change over time I often think back to yesterday years when I used to

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:05.160
I used to sit and wait for things to a page to load on dialogue and you know that was that was

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.080
fine you know I could wait 10 minutes it's perfectly subliminal however if that happened now

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.640
my perception is if things were taking 10 minutes to load I I'm probably carrying my hair out and if

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.480
you can see me realize I don't have much of that so it's interesting how not only is it subjective

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:29.240
but it changes over time and so I often do support myself to uh Michael Bolton definition which is

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.280
quality is value to some person at some time who matters and then every time I say that people

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.240
are like well you know but Michael didn't actually set that he actually did it as an expansion of

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:45.320
jerry and and this is why I think the book expanded and doubled in size because you have to qualify

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:52.180
everything that you write before you explain it to anyone in the past week yeah so the problem with

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.800
and Alan and I know this quite well the problem of doing anything that targets that community

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:06.090
you got to expect the testing community to test that's that's the issue

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:14.090
speaking of community you uh you quote Malcolm Gladwell on the book and you say if you want

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.650
this is a global quote if you want to bring a fundamental change in people's beliefs and behavior

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.970
you need to create a community around them where these new beliefs can be practiced and expressed

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.850
and nurtured so tell me about your thoughts on community and how they lead how they help you

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:37.380
with leading a quality culture well I think one of the things that is incredibly important

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:44.860
when you're thinking about being a leader of quality is that we have to be good at influence

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:51.000
those leaders and yes we're nodding we're nodding our heads loudly good because because

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.800
there's like the people from the sales background that love selling and then oftentimes with people

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.760
from a technical background who are like I don't sell that's not my thing that there's

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:07.260
a thought that to sell is like uh not as good because sometimes it's a little bit more fluffy

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:15.350
it's not as accurate and I truly believe that that thinking will limit people in the in the

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.070
quality in the testing space in order to make the change they want to make happen inside their

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:27.210
company because Daniel Pink has a book to sell as human and yes I think he pointed out we're huge

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:33.770
Dan Pink fans here on the AB test yes good good because you know he did this whole

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.490
study where he was like well it turns out that if you look at it the majority of your life is

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:46.410
selling something to someone whether that's your kid your partner your wife your boss and so we

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.330
all naturally sell but sometimes we don't think we should so coming back to your question of

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:56.330
you know how do I believe that the community can can help us as we inside our companies for

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.770
leaders and shape and quality it's really that if you are the only person in your company

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:08.580
trying to make that change it's going to be tough you need other people around you whether that is

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:14.740
your your peers your boss people in below you and your team you're going to need to start

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:20.900
influencing and persuading other people inside the organization to to almost think in the same way

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:26.020
as you but where I find people often go wrong and this is kind of what we found when we were

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.660
talking to the different people is that they believe that everyone else cares about the things

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:38.100
that they care about so when I hear people say oh you know the management team aren't listening to

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.780
me when I'm explaining this thing around quality I asked them what they explained and the thing

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:49.860
that always well it didn't surprise me but the thing that hurts me I guess is that often what

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.980
they describe has nothing to do with what management teams care about they're not talking

00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:02.420
in the context of how it sits from a revenue perspective or the potential uh monetary saving

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.580
they might talk about things like risk mitigation which is something we talk about in in the test

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:14.340
of quality space but on the spectrum of what's pressing for that executive you need to make

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:20.230
sure that you are attuning and saying things in the light that they care about and so this whole

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.670
idea of utilizing community inside your company so to make the changes that are changed I think

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:31.110
we always have to look at ourselves as leaders to work out how are we conveying the message and

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:36.710
what I like to call the quality narrative inside our company so that we can help make that change

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:44.150
happen and and sometimes I find that a blocker to change inside a company can be the existing

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:50.630
narrative that that is that if you're inside a company right now where you know there's what we

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.870
call that a poor ownership narrative so people believe that it's just the testing team that

00:18:54.870 --> 00:19:00.780
should own quality you've got to have trouble trying to get everyone to do to do stuff

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.740
around quality in order to get that change where everyone is involved in quality and is thinking

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.060
about quality there's going to need to be a narrative inside your business that hey ownership

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.900
is part of everybody's responsibility everyone has a part to play in making sure we have a good

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:21.420
quality product and so coming back to the whole Martin Gladwell quote it was really just trying to

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:27.500
encapsulate that when we are trying to make influence happen inside our company we have to

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:33.340
make sure that we are evolving multiple people and we have to also look at the narratives and the

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.380
stories that are being told inside our company and work out how to adjust more favor to get people

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:48.100
thinking about quality yeah um I have no so that that whole discussion you just had just reminded me

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:54.900
of all kinds of things I've said similar things in the past right the the one thing that I will call

00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:02.100
out is in order to influence in order to lead you have to have followers and and I find that this is

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:12.020
the this is the single most important thing people forget leadership is influence and and everyone

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.580
thinks it's a tautology but I'm like no if you don't have followers you're not leading now the

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:23.700
question this is how to get followers and and that is essentially by setting the narrative such that

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:31.800
that individual makes a choice that the direction that they're going to go is in your direction

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:39.820
because it is beneficial to them um you just thought I'd talk about some exciting stuff yes

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:48.540
right it's it's you can't go to the executive and say hey we need to stop shipping bugs

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:58.540
and and then fall back to old tired stories around you know bugs are bad or customers shouldn't be

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:05.500
testing you know principle-based things um if those principles aren't clearly aligned with

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:15.830
a business goals or how the business wants to run uh you're gonna be you're gonna waste less time just

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:23.340
banging your head against the wall uh literally yeah right because it's if you want to move forward

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:30.870
you how you express the narrative and how you communicate it in a way that the person you're

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:38.410
trying to influence cares is what matters yeah I can't wait to read the book and you know what you

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.930
just got me excited on something yeah because there's this there's this concept um that we

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:49.290
talk a lot about internally in our company which is right there of vision which is that you know

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.690
every company needs to have a vision of what they're doing where they go and then oftentimes

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.930
people like oh my goodness I'm not the vision for this company that's why I want to join etc

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:02.810
but the truth is I don't believe anyone cares about any company's vision whatsoever what they

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:08.010
care about is the vision for themselves and the company is just a vehicle by which they plan to

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:15.210
achieve that vision and so if you understand what the vision and direction of motivation

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.940
of the people that you're trying to influence you and you can talk about things that help them

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.300
understand that what you've just said to them will help move them in the direction of their

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:30.600
own personal vision they're going to be so much more involved yes for sure completely yeah

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:38.310
it there's a there was a multiple books pink did one and then there's a book that's one of my

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:44.710
favorites called influencer where they say if you can target yes extrinsic motivation

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:52.150
moves things along but if you can target an intrinsic motivator what personally drives that

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:58.420
individual it's 10 times more powerful what's your next question fully agreed fully agreed hey

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:06.580
uh I have a couple more to get to uh and all surprises for Brent of course um you in the book

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:13.860
you have a section that talks about growth metrics with a shout out to another our principles are

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.780
pretty much entirely based or largely based on uh the lean startup and you have a call out to

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:26.020
Eric reason they're uh talking about vanity metrics of course and growth metrics and which ties

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.940
again really strongly with our first principle our priority is improving the business so what's your

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.940
advice to testers who work in a company without good growth metrics how do they get started what

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.620
are they what do they do what if you're they read your book and go yeah we need some of these

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:46.170
growth metrics what do they do you know that's true because sometimes people in situations where

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.090
either their company isn't clear on the growth metric and they're not in a position to influence

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:59.580
the core company's growth metric but what we have to say is even if your company

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:05.850
doesn't have a clear metric for you to use you can still work out what yours is and and use it

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:12.650
as the basis of a the work that you do and being how you drive communication so for example

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:18.280
we often say that there are three main types of growth metrics that exist in product companies

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.360
and and for those that have no idea what a growth metric is it's really just the idea

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.200
what is the one metric inside your business that will help roll the business moving forward and

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.400
oftentimes it's not just we need more money because that's not really a very valuable useful

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.520
growth metric for the whole business it's usually where the customer derives value from

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.040
your product and so there are three broad categories that we often talk about when we

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.040
think of growth metrics the first one is attention-based growth metrics so companies that are B2C

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.040
where it's like media or gaming or entertainment they're often trying to grab people's attention

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.480
as for example this would be a company like Facebook where their core metric is the number

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:08.040
of daily active users so a lot of the work that their teams do is driven around how can

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:14.520
we increase the number of daily active users so while that team is testing instead of them just

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.840
testing and doing some triaging and you know I think this is critical that they're actually

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:27.610
going if we work on this problem if we solve or fix this bubble or prioritize it do we believe that

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:35.210
we'll have a big impact on increasing the number of daily active users in this um in the product

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.210
as a whole or if you're just working on a subset of the product whatever the the core

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:45.670
metrics that you're trying to push off at that point and by by having that kind of focus you

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:51.350
end up attuning your work to what the business cares about which is going to be the improvement

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.390
of that metric which is going to be like more users etc and you also start to have other people

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:01.590
in the business start to understand the value that you could bring and I often have arguments

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:06.870
with people and they're like no no the people in the community shouldn't be focused on the core

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:11.990
metrics for the business and I'm like that's probably why you're struggling to communicate

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:16.470
with the rest of the business because you're not you don't care about the things that they care

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.470
about and it all comes back to what we were talking about before when we were talking about

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:25.270
um influence etc so what I've been saying is that the first the first growth metric that

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.670
you might look at in an attention-based metric the the second part that you might look at

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:36.630
is a a transaction-based growth metric so if you have a e-commerce website or a a marketplace of

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:41.910
some kind there's often a transaction that has to happen so companies like airbnb their growth

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:47.030
metric is around the number of night books because when when someone books a night it's the moment

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:52.230
that the person that owns that property gets value and it's the time when the person who wants to

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:57.750
be in that property gets better value but but there's also this whole section of growth

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:03.270
metrics that is around productivity when you say productivity it's often for the the b2b space

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:10.950
because when we have b2b software it's usually a workflow design or some kind of improvement in

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:18.170
some sort of digital task that someone was trying to use that b2b software for and I love when I

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:24.890
looked at like what slack were doing where they had worked out that if they could get a a company

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:33.370
2 000 messages then they knew that it was something like 97 98 percent more likely to

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:39.370
go on to actually upgrade onto their school plan so everyone in their teams was so focused around

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:45.530
making sure that they hit that 2 000 they can work on the problems or solve the issues or do more

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:51.980
testing around the things that would improve that 2 000 number and so this whole idea of

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:58.940
growth metric is really about making sure that you are focusing on activity that if you can change

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.500
an effect have the biggest impact to the rest of the business and then when I talk about this I

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.380
sometimes have people argue and they say well but you shouldn't just focus on one metric because

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:13.500
loads of metrics to focus on and yes of course there are lots of other metrics for people to

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:19.900
focus on but if you're trying to have the biggest impact in your role in the business

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.180
that you're in beginning to think about what's going to drive our business and always have that

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.660
at the back of your mind if you're making decisions will only make you more valuable

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:36.570
as a tester and even if the stuff that you work on a day-to-day basis you haven't been able to find

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.730
something that's going to move that needle incredibly well but you're still talking in

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:47.130
the business about this idea unless the rest of the business know that you understand and care about

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:52.970
driving a business forward whereas most times when people have conversations that I find when

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:59.560
they're talking about testing they keep it so technical and testing related that it becomes

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:05.880
hard for others to really engage and so coming back to this whole idea of leaving quality it's

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:12.440
really just about ensuring that what we're talking about and the messages that people hear from our

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.960
part of the business is we understand and care about the business and we think that there are

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.080
certain things that we might be able to do to help push and affect that the more that anyone can

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.920
have that narrative in their personal role or inside their department the more value like people

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:34.120
are going to find for the work that they do and this is really what we believe from what we see

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:43.380
Yeah, I... Brent was nodding his head a lot. Yeah, I've said many of the many things that you've

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:51.540
talked about. Dow-MOW, daily active users divided by monthly active users I use all the time. It's a

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:58.980
fantastic measure of stickiness whether or not your customers are coming back and they're finding

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:06.580
value in your thing or are you just having a... you're able to constantly bring in new

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:14.500
customers but they don't stick around right? What's that? Sorry, I was just saying when you look at that

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.020
you know those are the most important questions that we need to be asking and one of the things

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.780
I love about the testing community they always ask incredible questions. Yes. And ensuring that

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.100
they're asking some of these business context questions which come down to the fundamentals

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.260
should we be rebuilding this sometimes. You know the value that we can bring in our questioning

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.740
is incredible so it's just ensuring that we're using the skill sets we already have

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:45.860
but ensuring that we're adding the business side to the conversation that we have around the business.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:54.260
Yeah, it's one of the things... so the old definition of quality, the traditional point of

00:30:54.260 --> 00:31:03.300
view of quality is essentially bugs. It's what I now call code correctness. I won't talk about

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:12.180
bugs and code as a quality issue. Quality in my view can only be defined by the actual

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:21.030
consumer of the product that you're building. But it can be measured by people within the product,

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:27.190
it can be evaluated, it can be improved. I completely agree with you that one of the

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:32.310
strengths in the test community is its systems thinking and its critical thinking skills.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:39.510
And I do in fact dream of the day and where the community at large, I've converted multiple

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:45.510
test teams myself, but the community at large realizes that applying that skills towards the

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:55.910
definition of quality that you are suggesting is... and I'm a data scientist by trade so I'm making

00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:02.870
up numbers now, but I do believe it's an order of magnitude difference in the value proposition

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:12.870
that these same individuals can use with their same skills. It is much more valuable to go in

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:18.780
this new direction in this man's humble opinion. So I don't know if you're done with your questions,

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:25.980
but I do want to ask Ron one of the common questions we get all the time on this. I'd

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:33.110
love to hear your answer. So Ron, that's all nice and good, but that's the PM's job.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.790
I guess that wasn't a question.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:45.910
I can't worry about the business. My job is to find bugs. That's someone else's responsibility.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.260
I abstain. So I'm wondering...

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:58.460
My response to that is actually just good luck. Good luck for your long-term career prospects.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.470
So he doesn't have a better answer than we do.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:13.030
So I do have some thoughts, right? So I was sitting down with Haseen and Zet the other day,

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:21.370
and we were talking about defining roles versus gray area. And oftentimes people are like,

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:28.250
oh, I really, I just feel like we need to define my role a bit more. I feel like I need to be clearer

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:34.170
what I'm doing and where I'm going. And she said something, she said, here's the thing.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:42.180
If I work with someone and they are so stringent on I will only do the thing that pertains to my

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:48.100
role, then I know I've got a problem with that person. Because in life, in business, there's

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.540
always new things happening. There's always changes that happen. So if you're not comfortable with

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:59.900
gray, you probably shouldn't be working with a company. And it is the gray where you actually

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:05.100
get to provide a big different amount of value. And so this question of, hey, that is not my

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:10.940
responsibility to look at what we're doing in this business. I think it's everyone's responsibility.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:18.620
I would much rather be in a company where every single person down to from the CEO down to the

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:25.820
janitor is going, that doesn't look right. I should probably raise that. If you don't have

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.260
that mentality in your business, and you're not a person that has that mentality,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.900
there is probably somebody out there who could do your same role and add that additional value.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:41.980
And the business that you're in would probably be promoting them faster and be having them do even

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.420
more interesting things because they're going to be trying to make sure that person's mind is

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:51.180
attuned and they're going to just work with them harder. I hate working with people that

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:59.100
aren't looking at their role and asking themselves about that role in context of the whole business.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:05.910
Even when I work with developers and meet developers, I would much rather work with a developer who is

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.470
asking critical questions about where we're going as a business than someone that just agrees to

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:15.750
code the thing that I told them to go. Because no one has all the context and knowledge in their

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:19.750
mind. It's this collective knowledge, these cross-functional teams that have the most value.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:25.750
So if someone actually began saying that to me, I think I'd begin a rant with them

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:29.110
on how much value they're truly providing and where do they think their life is going.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:36.220
But yeah, maybe I don't have a good answer. No, no, no. So that one is more aligned. One of

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:43.850
the things you went a different direction, but one I still agree with is one of the things

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:53.610
that I've seen lately is a rise in the number of companies making an explicit shift away from,

00:35:54.490 --> 00:36:05.320
particularly in the tech world, away from specialist roles. Because the need for a specialist

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:17.420
is sort of Moore's law of software development or personnel in the software world. You hire a deep

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:24.440
database expert and then realize, oh, our product is now going in a new direction where we don't

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:33.320
require a database. If that's all that guy can do, you've got a problem. And so there's definitely a

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:42.360
move towards what's known as a versatility or a tee sheet person. So people who are deeply knowledgeable

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:51.420
in two to three areas and are adaptable. And I'm now at a point when someone, I will probe them on

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:59.350
two or three questions. And if I determine, no, this guy's closed-minded and his content being a

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:06.870
specialist, then I just go, okay, I'm done with the conversation, right? Please come back to me when

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:16.150
you realize you actually need me and don't want to just argue. Some people don't want to be helped.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:26.650
That's my question. One last question. I think we all have a hard stop coming up here, but

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:34.120
in reading your book and then in our conversations, you saw like we did that your book aligned with

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:40.360
a few of the modern testing principles. And believe it or not, these principles have been

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:46.040
controversial to some and some principles more controversial than others. One I wanted to bring

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:52.360
up was you said that your book aligned with our fifth principle, which believe it or not has been

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:59.880
controversial. We believe the customer is the only one who can judge quality is the customer as king

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:07.640
principle, which we fully believe. But believe it or not, we have had rather severe pushback from

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.280
some people in the test community on this principle. I'm just curious on your thoughts on

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:19.480
how your thoughts align with the customer being the only one who can value equality.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:32.630
When I'm actually, I'm not one who actually fits and argues with people who are adamant that they're

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:37.670
right, because it's not worth the energy. It's not worth the time. When it comes to this whole

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:42.790
idea of influence, one thing that I personally learned is if someone categorically does not

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:47.670
want to change or want to be influenced, there is nothing that I can say that's going to help them.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:52.390
I would much rather work with someone that is ready to hear an idea. And yes, they may have

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:58.790
questions around it or they don't agree, but still have taken the time to understand what

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:03.990
had been said. So usually in cases where people are like arguing some ideas, I just don't have the

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:08.790
time. I'd rather sit and talk to someone who is on the path that needs a bit of context to help them

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:13.110
move forward. I think that's how we make a bigger change. And then by that point, we have enough

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:19.080
people that means the person who could, who wouldn't listen, no longer could not listen.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:25.960
But on the idea of the customer being the main person of Jonas Quality,

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:33.880
I believe this is so wholeheartedly. I often think about the idea of customer personas that are

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:41.480
created by marketing and product. And companies would create these personas like Eileen Enterprise,

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:48.200
who works at Enterprise, and she does this. And these personas are awesome for the product,

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.200
for the product and marketing team, for them to generalize something.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:58.600
But the truth is, when we actually start to look at quality, there are quite an infinite number of

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:05.160
personas because every single person who picks up that application or who logs on to that

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.760
application to use it, they expect it to work perfectly for them in their conditions.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.520
Which means, in my mind, there isn't just a small two or three personas that we have to deal

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.400
with in our company. There's actually loads of them. And we call them local personas because

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.760
every single device, every single location, all the different presentations become unique personas

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.430
that we have to end up looking at. And then once again, coming back to this whole idea,

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:36.470
it was really going to drive value for our company. You can start to look at your personas

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:42.950
and go, okay, so out of our customer base, we have right now, what are the locations or devices

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:48.310
or the usage patterns that they're seeing where we should actually focus our testing to make sure

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:52.630
the people we care about the most, we can have the biggest impact on.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:56.230
And that's in the case where you're trying to look at your existing personas. But oftentimes,

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.870
and this is all about thinking about streaming from a business perspective,

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:04.390
but when you look at the quality, oftentimes, the customers that you want in the future are not

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.350
like your existing customers. They might not be on the same devices. They might not be in

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:11.910
the same location. So you actually now need to test differently. You need to think about

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.590
testing from a different perspective because you're now dealing with new personas that you're

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:22.730
not currently looking at. And so I look at this whole thing in the same way the manufacturing

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:27.450
industry went. There was a time in the manufacturing industry where they spent all of their time just

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:34.090
focused on optimizing the production flow. And then after a couple of years, total quality

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:38.570
management movement came along and they were like, guys, I think we should be caring about

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.090
how these products work for our customers. And people were like, what are you talking about?

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:48.010
What was your idea? And then over time, people were like, wow, if we build

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:54.070
products that a customer actually wants to use, we can sell more business. And I almost

00:41:54.070 --> 00:42:00.870
feel like we have an industry that's going on. That's crazy talk. Crazy talk, customer.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:03.910
Yeah. I feel like we're in the same journey.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:12.310
Your manufacturing paradigm is spot on. We still hear it today. The single most important thing

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:21.350
is that we make sure that our devs times are efficiently utilized. And then you find out,

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:30.520
okay, they're not producing at fast rates. And even then, there's no idea of what value

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:36.840
is of the thing that they produce. Right. Great. You have a machine that produces code like crazy

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:44.660
that no one uses. Congrats. Exactly. And the reason why I know this following a similar trend

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.380
is because every single methodology that we use inside software development right now

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:54.980
has its roots in the manufacturing process. All of these Kaizen lead manufacturing, oh,

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:59.700
let's look at DevOps. Let's look at Agile. All of these come from manufacturing processes.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:06.740
I say history repeats itself. We're going through the exact same evolution. I know in 10 years' time,

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.460
people are going to be like, well, of course, we need to make sure the quality is defined

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.500
by the customer. What else would you do? But hey, it takes time for people to change and adjust

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.940
their thinking. Now, if you spend 50 years of your life with one paradigm, it is hard naturally

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:27.370
to have a new paradigm. But over time, the ground will happen and change happens.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:36.010
We got to go. When does your book come out? And so Ron's book is Leading Quality. It comes out when?

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.860
So it comes out the beginning of August. So actually just about a month away.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.460
Okay. And where can our three listeners buy it?

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:53.300
So your listeners can go to Amazon.com or .co.uk or whatever your URL is in your local location.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:58.340
And you can order it there. You can also go to leadingqualitybooks.com.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.180
And you can request a free chapter. And actually, I think you can sign up now.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:08.180
In the first week of the book being released, we give the Kindle version away for free as part

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.860
of our own promotion to just make sure that people understand these ideas.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.780
People just need to hear the stories and have the new reference points about what they can

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.660
do to lead quality. And I honestly believe I'm going to spend a large part of my life,

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.460
as well as my co-founder, just preaching and messaging about how do we lead quality.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.700
And I honestly believe in 10 years time, people who listen to this podcast is being like,

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:39.130
well, those guys will listen to the future. Yes. It's a great book. I've read it. Ron

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.930
Cummings, John, the book again, it's called Leading Quality. I'll put some links to it

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:46.570
in the show notes. Thank you very much for taking some time out of your day to recur

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:53.290
with us today. And we will look forward to rereading the book, Brent reading it,

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:58.250
and to the three people who listen to our podcast, reading it and getting the word out.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:02.310
Thank you, Ron. Thank you so much. All right. See you.
