WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Hey, thanks for listening to the show today, this is Alan, and before the show starts I

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.880
wanted to warn you that we had some audio issues arise during editing.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.720
I lost a microphone, had to try and make up for that with some level changes, and with

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.520
that I got extra sounds of Brent breathing, some microphone rumbling, and in the end

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.920
a lot of clicks and pops in the last third of the show.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920
Good content, I hope you enjoy.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920
Thanks again for listening.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:40.220
Hey everybody, hello, I'm Alan, I'm Brent, and it is episode 42 of a video.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.420
I'm going to be testing, how about that, 42.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.100
Yes, and unlike the usual reference to 42, this episode will not be the answer to life,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.500
the universe, and everything.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500
No, it'll be the answer to, hey Alan, why angry weasel?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.540
I'm going to kick off episode 42 with some good old fashioned venting.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.660
Yes.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.020
First of all, Brent.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.300
I understand the angry part, and I know you've told me the story approximately 50,000 times,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.860
I don't get the weasel part.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.260
There is a story on, hey, I resemble that comment.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.420
There is a story I've posted on the long, long story, I'll give you the paraphrase

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:31.230
version, but if you go to AngryWeasel.com, the sponsor of AB testing, if you go there,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.190
there is a story about the weasel or something like that along the banner at the top of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.320
the blog.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.080
It talks about the fact that many, many, many years ago, I was playing in this rock funk

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.200
band and we were trying to decide on a band name.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.040
One time we had some temporary names, one of these bands had a different name for every

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.960
show for a while.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.360
Then we're talking to someone after a show and they're telling a story about how they

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.760
were driving through Germany and got some car trouble because they're stuck by the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.440
side of the road.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.080
Someone pulled over to help them, this kind of strange German, this is right out of a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.430
weird movie.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.150
Stephen King.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.300
Not maybe Stephen King, maybe more Kevin Smith.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.010
But they started talking about the weasels and said, beware of the tooth of the weasel.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.170
It's not a very good German accent, but they heard the story about the tooth of the weasel

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.010
and they talked about Angry Weasel and that's it.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.010
That's it.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.700
That's the band name, Angry Weasel.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.900
Even the band said, yeah.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.660
Our guitar player said, no, I don't like it.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.300
I said, screw you, I am getting angryweasel.com, I'm going to keep it.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.700
I owned angryweasel.com for about three or four years before I finally moved my blog

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.820
over to angryweasel.com.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.020
It was originally going to be a band name, I just took over the name and have a logo

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.180
now and everything, that's where Angry Weasel came from.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.140
So nothing to do with Pauly Shore?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.780
Nothing to do with me actually being angry except for today.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.380
Because let me tell you just a couple things.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.100
It's been a while since I talked about dumb things Microsofties do.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.300
Alan, soapbox, box, box, box, box.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.680
So this is not really it.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.150
No sound effects.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.910
So Brent and I are meeting two floors below my floor.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.910
Why?

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.910
Do you ask?

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.910
Oh, why?

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.790
Because the meeting rooms on my floor are all booked.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.150
Even weirdly, we're in the middle of a move and there are only 10 people on my

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.590
entire floor, yet our meeting rooms are booked all morning.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.150
Why?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.060
Because people, who I won't use adjectives to describe, we have a lot of Microsoft

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.980
employees just decide to have, it would be fun to go have a meeting in Lincoln Square

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.020
so they come over to Lincoln Square now meetings.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.460
Okay, fine, done it before.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.980
And then we have other people who book meeting rooms like recurring meetings, big

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.980
long meetings and just never show up.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.460
So you can't actually book the room.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.810
Understand, there's 10 people on the floor, the meeting room right next to my office

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.530
that I want to use all the time.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.250
I can never use because somebody I don't even know or work with or have seen before

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.820
takes up claim for a four hour meeting in that meeting room.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.180
Do you have, you think you have enough clout to take that meeting room offline?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.660
I can't, but I do have enough clout to, there's a, I try not to do this

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.500
because I can, but I can actually, one thing, career advice for everybody in the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.260
world, career advice for everybody.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
If you have an admin on your team, be nice to them.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.420
Oh gosh, yes.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.910
Because they actually run the organization.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.670
So I have enough clout to go to our admin and say, you can do this at Microsoft.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.070
You can say, can you please restrict meeting rooms on our floor to our

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.870
organization so other teams can't book them.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.670
They can do that.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.350
They can do that.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.640
How?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.920
It's just a, I'm going to have to go talk to my admin.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.480
Yes, it can be done.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.000
I can't have it for myself, but I can have it for my org.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.800
I've recently, recently moved buildings.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.520
We haven't done a podcast in that one yet, but there is only one

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.140
conference room on my floor.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.980
And for the longest time, it was locked out.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.880
It was the, it, it was under exact lock out.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.630
Yeah, that was cool.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.620
All right, so rant number two.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.960
I think the secret to dealing with the meeting rooms is just have no meetings.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.360
Honestly, it's a really a first world problem.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.750
It's really, I mostly use meeting rooms for podcasts.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.350
We do our stand up just next to our desks.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.610
When you come to our building the next time, I'll show you my office.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.090
Coolest, biggest office I've ever had.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.650
And now whenever I have like team meetings, I just do it in my office.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.070
I'm just angry as a weasel because-

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.350
I'm really feeling the anger emotion.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.350
Yeah, I was.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.550
I wanted to use the room and I thought I had a book, but I guess I did.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.190
And the guys that were in there were kind of dickish, so

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.870
they kind of pushed my buttons a little bit.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.670
Hey.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.390
Hey, so that room next to you?

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.070
Yeah.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.470
I have a suggestion for you.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.470
Yeah.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.740
Hang up a scrum board right on the wall outside of that conference room.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.700
And just do spontaneous and very loud stand up every half hour until

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.940
people start unbooking that room.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.020
We're out of stage at our product where I kind of knew this would happen.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.380
And I haven't played the game if I told you so.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.460
I'm playing the game of dig ourselves out.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.900
Where things were going swimmingly and

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.340
we are pushing towards a big milestone and our GPM,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.540
GPM and our ship room meeting said,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.580
really important we have these features done for this milestone.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.290
And I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.890
The past tells me that when you make statements like that,

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.450
people will shove in stuff without doing their due diligence about quality.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.450
Just those features need to be done.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.580
It's critical for the product.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.020
And I said, OK, because it wasn't a fight.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.140
What are you going to say?

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.100
I wanted to have it.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.260
It wasn't going to go anywhere.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.500
I believe in discussion and even disagreement

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.660
as a method of getting to an end.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.740
I think it inspires creativity in this case.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.610
There wasn't anything to do at that point.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:49.100
So anyway, what happened is we have what I'm calling feature jam.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.810
And we just took a snap of our product has

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.130
been getting progressively worse.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.270
Shocking.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.790
I'm not shocked.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.950
All I can do is do my best to make sure we get out of the hole.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.270
But it is we took a snap.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.310
I'm a little angry to start off with this morning because we took a snap last

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:16.230
night from our sea environment to our pre-production environment,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.390
where normally we can sit for like a day and be OK.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.990
It's good.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.510
Let's stop this to broad.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.270
It is for the last three weeks, especially this one.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.910
Just awful.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.270
I've just I'm really frustrated and almost embarrassed about how every time I see

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.590
people make these type of mistakes, right?

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:42.070
The other mistake that I see is that they don't use it as an opportunity to

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.850
to make this a learning org.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.370
Right. So what are you doing to make sure the next time doesn't do this shit?

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.130
That is absolutely what I'm doing.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.330
So lots of stuff going on.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.810
Trying to do a lot of the work to make sure some of these things don't happen

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.330
again, as well as just there's two things lacking, I think.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.010
One is lack of developer testing, even trying their thing out before they check

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.930
it in, they're getting better at that.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:15.260
And where the learning is going to come from is in an org that up until

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.820
the pressure kind of hit was a very open org with lots of communication.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.740
Everybody knew what was going on in the last, I don't know,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.580
some amount of time, month or so.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.900
As the products become more real and more something that we're going to ship

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:36.900
to real people in a fairly soon timeframe, the pressure has made them silo

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.180
a little bit and that communication has gone away.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.340
I think the key to being successful, you cannot ship a product as often as we

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.380
want to ship without very transparent communication across the org.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.740
So we have teams breaking other teams with their changes, feature teams

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.540
breaking other features with their changes.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.260
I think primarily due to lack of communication, hey, I didn't know you were

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.180
going to do that, or why did you do that, or should have had a discussion

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.540
about that, sorts of things.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.700
So those things are happening, they would always happen, but they're

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.900
happening noticeably faster, in fact, exponentially faster than before.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.460
So to me, that's the key part of the problem.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.020
That's the key thing.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.620
So that's a good thing.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.980
That we're trying to, I believe that communication could solve the

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.700
majority of the issues that I have seen over the last few weeks.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:31.820
Your story reminds me of how I execute my Kanban board on my team.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:40.020
We have these tickets, as the three well know, I haven't had a bug

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.700
database in years, we have these tickets we call swarm tickets, and

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:51.060
periodically we go through a period where essentially all the work that

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.860
we're doing is nothing but swarm tickets.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.340
Swarm tickets, when they come up on the board, they're treated like

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.220
bugs, and when they come up on the board, we have to knock them down

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.300
in 48 hours, and that means we're not doing feature work.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.060
So you can, for those who are familiar with the concept of bug jail,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.000
it's like we have a zero bug bug jail.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.800
One of the nifty things as a tool of having these tickets in this process

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:23.520
and a very visible board is that we can very readily see when we're in the

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.320
midst of what we've now come to term as swarm storm, where it's essentially

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.160
we're going on for a large period of time and all we're doing is knocking

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.080
down swarm tickets.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:45.400
And one of the insights that I learned from the author of Personal Kanban,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.280
Oh yeah, Benson, Jim Benson.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.450
Jim Benson, I always think of Jim Henson, but that's not the right guy,

00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:02.850
was that too many swarm tickets is actually a sign of going too fast.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:10.460
And I have used that over and over again to slow the team down, do the

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.380
proper root cause analysis, do the proper retrospective to figure out what

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.840
shortcut have we been making that we should not be, and fix it.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:29.760
And then almost always that causes a near order of magnitude boost in productivity.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.760
And it's counterintuitive, but once you work through what the board is doing

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.190
is telling you what the crappy bottleneck on your team is.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.150
But if I can be briefly optimistic, I would say that when we dig ourselves out,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.310
the team will be better than they were before.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:53.580
Cause now there's a lot of learning from mistakes as we all know,

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.550
and we're doing a lot of learning right now.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:04.070
Yeah, I'm not as optimistic as you are because I've seen broken window theory

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.790
happen over and over again in exactly the same situation.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.870
I've seen it too.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.950
What I've seen is the GPM gets too much power,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:19.030
and then your next six month milestone, what he's going to communicate is,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.430
this is how we ship product.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.950
This is just the world we live in.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:31.270
Devs should buck up Buttercup and figure out how to cram in these extra features

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.450
and quit screwing the customer.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.250
The thing I hate about this power struggle,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.170
cause the way you tell the story, and I hope it's not true,

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.890
but the way you tell the story is you got like an old school GPM,

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.050
and those guys get reviewed on their ability to cram in additional features.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.180
So let me add something now that I'll probably edit out.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.260
Alan here, we cut that part.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.490
All right, back to the show.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.490
I think all of the three are on Twitter.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.090
And if you've been on Twitter, you've noticed over the last week or two,

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:12.410
a lot of talk about the context driven testing community.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.410
I have this weird take on context driven testing.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.120
I'm not against it.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.440
I'm all for it, but the thing is with me is I'm a little bit removed

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.920
from the conversation or the concept,

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.320
because I don't really believe in context driven testing, not directly.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.320
I do believe, in fact, the difference is I believe that I don't believe

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.960
in schools of testing.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.840
Sure, there are people that get paid to push buttons all day,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.920
and you can say they're the factory school or whatever,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.640
but I just believe that all good testing and all good software

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.520
development in general and all knowledge work,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.370
anyone who is good at any sort of knowledge work is context driven by

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.330
necessity.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.610
So I don't understand the need to say, well, I'm in the context driven school.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.730
Just like, what the, I don't even get it.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.250
So just the whole concept alienates me.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.410
So it's hard for me to figure out where I stand in this conversation.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.130
I have my opinions of James Bach.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.290
Again, I can talk to him.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.010
There's there have been psychological studies.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.690
Obviously, we don't prep on this show.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:20.210
So I'm not going to give any references that shows that as your EQ or

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.770
is your IQ goes up, your EQ goes down.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:30.340
So it's very, it's not uncommon where super smart people,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:39.820
they're extremely logical, don't have much room for compassion in some regards.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.380
Right.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.140
What the point is this way is I choose to ignore James.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.980
I know he's deaf.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.020
I read his blog post, but I just kind of ignore him.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:16:00.100
Is he is his loud, not physically loud, but is his leadership damaging testing in any way?

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.340
Is question A for you, Brent?

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:08.500
And B is by not standing up to him more and

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.540
not involving myself in the discussion more, am I damaging testing?

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.830
I think on the CDT front, right?

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:26.270
The whole school's topic in from my world view is done, is over, right?

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.750
It doesn't make sense.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:35.270
The I also strongly disagree with the content,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.550
the CDT, the context driven testing.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:43.830
Because testing in my view is context driven.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:48.230
It is entirely redundant having a separate school.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.430
That one now famous slide that we've talked about, right?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:59.540
James is potentially attacking the agile movement.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:05.820
It's one of those things where that movement that is successful,

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.820
it is helping businesses build value.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:15.180
And my point is, my view is his leadership,

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.500
if there are people kind of viewing

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:27.660
James's role in the testing community, quite honestly,

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.020
it used to be important.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.180
Its importance has shrunk dramatically.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.770
I think people like Elizabeth Hendrickson and

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:47.650
Lisa Crispin are much better leaders for testing in this new world.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.770
And I think the importance of his content has shrunk to,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.510
I don't know, cult size.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.020
It is, and I sort of, I don't know if we're ganging up on James,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.300
but I'm glad we're talking about him in this context.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.500
Because I think his, to me,

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:15.080
his influence on testing has been diminishing for some time.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.900
The size of the population of testers that can benefit from RST,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.820
Rapid Software Testing, his primary source of income, as far as I can tell,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.140
is still a huge pool out there.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.900
But it's not the people I hang out with that's not diminishing.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.140
So I, like people say stupid stuff on the internet every day.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.740
Every day.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:46.540
When James says something stupid, because he has a larger following than most of the other people saying stupid stuff,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.740
does it make a bigger difference?

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.220
Part of me says I should just call him out when he's being,

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.500
when he's out of context.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.860
I don't have time for that crap either.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:01.700
My advice to you, Alan, is, right, you're already doing it.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:08.130
Look, I've coined what I call Jensen's law of politics.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.730
And it is essentially this.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:14.620
He who is defensive loses always.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:21.660
And his response, his abrasiveness, in my view, is an act of defensiveness.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.340
That last slide is an act of defensiveness.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.380
It is...

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.740
It challenges his world.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.580
It challenges his world.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:37.940
Some people get defensive by getting defensive, and others get defensive by going on the attack.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.500
He's more on the attack style.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:47.860
We have been very good on this show, as well as before we were doing the show,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:55.860
of aligning with the momentum of the future, future, future, future.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.980
Right?

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.300
Well, let me interrupt there.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.300
And I think we're fairly decent at it.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.700
I think so too.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:14.900
And I think that one thing is, this is going to sound weird, but by those of us that look at the future and adapt,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.300
we talked about software being predictive, iterative, adaptive,

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:26.020
adapting to what's needed for the context of shipping software is more context driven

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.750
than a lot of what happens in the CDT air quote community.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.430
So those of you, and I'm just going to add this right now,

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:39.870
those of you right now getting tired of the boom, boom, boom in the background,

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:44.190
Brent is like fondling the heck out of his microphone stand and won't stop.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.790
It's awkward.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.630
It's...

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.870
Sigmund Freud is like watching right now to see what happens.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.000
And I'm freaking out a little.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.560
All right, where were we?

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.790
I'm sorry, Dylan.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:03.750
So the one last thing on the subject is there was some talk about James and...

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.030
Whoa.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:11.270
James and Michael Bolton wrote a paper on the context driven...

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.310
context driven testers guide to automation or something like that.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.030
I was a reviewer on it earlier, almost exactly a year ago.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.710
I blogged about this.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.150
My name is listed as a reviewer.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.910
I didn't know it.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:27.910
The paper is my feedback is mostly grammatical and flow and like, no, this isn't what you called it, etc.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:33.070
And then there was some feedback around the approach used.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:38.910
What that paper is about, and I'll summarize it, it's about how we use some tools to help us test this product,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.190
which I think is a good thing to do.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.550
I use that all the time.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.750
It wasn't a paper about test automation.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.910
They use some tools to help them test the product.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.470
They didn't actually automate anything of value.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.430
So it's...

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.510
If you want to learn about test automation, not the paper to read.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:58.150
But it's a fine paper on, oh, hey, we use some random tools that weren't quite appropriate,

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.700
but we made them work to test some random software to show that we could do it.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.700
Yeah. I mean...

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.380
So I...

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.700
And this paper was published a year ago?

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.220
No, I reviewed it a year ago.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.910
I think it came out like three or four months ago.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.390
Maybe six months ago.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:21.990
Three or four months ago, a paper that describes essentially a manual STE world that,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.390
hey, look at the nifty tool that we just learned about that makes our life easier.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.030
Three or four months ago?

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.190
Really?

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:37.500
Yeah. Going back to your last question, Alan, my advice to you is just take the high road.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.660
These guys are just on the wrong path.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.500
I think so too.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.460
And it's just a waste of your time.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.380
Right. So I think the answer is I should just ignore them.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:54.900
I'm not doing a huge disservice by not standing up, but I probably will if I'm ever bored.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.620
Yeah. Your last blog post seemed to be about this drama.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.060
Yeah. And somebody called you out and wanted you to push back.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.940
Oh, Chris McMahon said, hey, you're reviewing this paper. What's your take on it?

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.300
I said, I don't think it's a very good paper. I reviewed it. Sure.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:15.500
So is Chris asking you to take Michael and James on?

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:23.290
I don't know. Chris and Noah Sussman, two people who I respect the shit out of are both

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.730
they have both been attacked directly by James. So they're and I'm full of support of them.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:34.210
I would support them. So I will do I will do what they much as they ask me to do within

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.180
my ethics and time.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:45.180
So, hey, we have a few minutes left. Let's talk about something you're doing like data

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:51.610
driven change. So I don't know if we have enough time to really flesh out this topic.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:56.330
Thanks, everybody. Yeah. But let's give us an overview. It'll inspire some questions

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:05.420
that we use those 43. So one of the the just another shout out those who are listening

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:15.420
in and want to be attached to more of the A.B. testing community. Right. We do have a

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:25.900
Slack channel. You can you can direct message per Z P.E.R.Z.E.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.860
I think you and I are admins on the site, too. Yeah, but I like it. Percy as our admin.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:43.380
So I'm going to keep advertising you per Z until you you you cry uncle enjoying one of the

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:51.700
questions that has popped up on the slack channel quite often is hey, great. We're big believers

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:57.260
in this data driven culture, this data driven change. But how do we do it? I think that's

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:06.460
probably a full episode. Alan recently went through a similar thing. I don't. I did. You

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:13.580
did in my view where essentially you had a PM who was the way you described it initially.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:21.900
You had a PM who was building yet another. The metrics scorecard. Yeah. Stoplight scorecard

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.300
filled with entity metrics, none of which are useful. And that's how you initially

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.940
described it. And then we talked later and he's like, oh, no, this guy's on the board.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.140
So what was the difference for you there? Like initially you're like, oh, my God, is

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.780
a PM. This is what he's going to build. Yes, there was a lot of talk about the default

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:46.220
built. Start talking about building dashboards from telemetry. The default they seem to

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:53.620
always fall into is, oh, let's record how many people use our feature. How many people

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:58.300
click this button? That's great. But you don't learn anything from that. There's no

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:04.140
insights from that other than vanity stroking. So I was worried there was a lot of talk about

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.700
this. I went and talked to the PM. I said, hey, I didn't want to tell him he was wrong.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.380
I just want to figure out where he's coming from, blah, blah, blah. Turns out he actually

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:18.880
has a good background in experimentation and he knows that those metrics have some but little

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:26.720
value. But he also knows he's a good PM because he knows that at first to get people to shut

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.080
up, he was going to give them what they wanted, which were the dashboards that show their

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:36.280
little vanity metrics and when they go, oh, look, I have a dashboard. But in parallel,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:43.640
help make sure they build dashboards that show customer value and business value and

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:52.340
get some insights as well to eventually be used instead of usage metrics have limited.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:58.060
I won't say no value, limited value, but he is actually on the board as far as how

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.420
for two things I wanted to follow up on. One, building scorecards, for lack of a

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:10.220
better word, dashboards that show business value and customer value of a feature. And

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:18.070
then also did not blink an eye when I said I want I believe in experimentation culture

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:22.190
where everything's an experiment. He nodded his head said, yes, that's absolutely where

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:27.430
I want to go to. And when I get that agreement, I go, okay, we're cool. Move along. I have

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.230
other things to worry about. I have confidence in you to take this forward. So it was

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.870
going into discussion. I was worried as hell coming out. I said, okay, he's got it covered.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.070
Time will tell whether I have false confidence or not, but I feel good about it now.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.870
So the PM is building the scorecard. It's a good thing. Because the first thing that

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:48.790
you're trying to do is create an asset that drives the business. Create convergence where

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:56.190
everybody's eyeballs are looking at this, knowing full well that in a few months, you're

00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:03.150
going to push, you're going to self push back on the metric that you built. Because oh my

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:09.510
God, I just realized there's a better one or oh my God, I just realized it's wrong. Okay,

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:16.590
the first the step one is to create a site that people converge towards. Then the next

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:22.610
that that creates a vernacular creates a language creates something that people are concerned

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:28.210
with. Okay, you use the motivation that they're already used to and people are already used

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:36.990
to you can't ship until the scorecard shows all green. Okay, then what I will often do

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:48.400
is create a companion site that's a bit more actionable and then link these two together.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.280
So you have this one scorecard that shows all these yellow numbers. Then you create this

00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:00.480
other companion site where people can drill down and see what's known as Pareto order.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.900
What's the biggest bang for the buck that we should go after in order to turn this

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:18.120
green? The challenge with your strategy that this PM is executing is that you constantly

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:25.010
have to change these KPIs if you want to get there. I don't one of the things that scares

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.050
me about that is I don't want to over index on the on the stoplight, red, yellow, green

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:39.090
dashboards. To me, in my experience, insight is addictive. Yes. And by that I mean to explain

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.730
Brett gets it but the moment like you look at how they could use like it. How much

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.570
time they push the button. Okay, oh, great. It was 500 years today 600 today. That's

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:50.330
great. It means nothing. There's no insight from that. But when I can start to connect

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:57.450
some things go okay, this number went up here. The same time we added this feature at night.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:02.610
And I look at some different metrics together and I go, ah, ha, well, people find an insight

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:09.650
they go, oh, I want to find another one. It's awesome drug. Oh, it is. So I want to

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:15.010
get people to a stage where the dashboards or whatever met however they're looking at

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.370
the metrics, I'll stick with the dashboards for now, but it can lead them to insights.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:24.050
Because right the vanity metrics, there's no insights that come from those. But if I

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:29.130
can find a way for them to get the right data in front of them, where they can start to

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:35.410
find first find insights and then search for insights. This doesn't require business

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:41.600
intelligence require data science or statistics necessarily. Brent's rolling his eyes a little

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.480
bit to be some of the more advanced stuff, air quotes again, yeah, we'll take that.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.360
But any PM without a math degree should be able to any engineer any knowledge worker

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:58.280
without a math degree should be able to look at some set of data and begin to find some

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.640
insights. And once you find insights, you will begin to search for insights. And once

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.680
you search for insights, your path to the dark side is clear. I mean, the good the

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.760
forest the good side. So I recently pulled together a deck on how to build a data centric

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.600
culture. And there are three phases I would say a team goes through. And the first one

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:27.920
is data oblivious and data oblivious essentially means I've talked to actual customers, I

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:34.490
know what they want. Anyway, oblivious, then what happens? Then it's data centric. And

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:39.130
that's really what you're building when you build this scorecard. Yeah, sure. It's

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:47.670
okay. Now we need to have data driving the course of the business and it's here driving

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.870
with data centric is different than data driven. I assume you're going there. Yeah,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:57.870
data driven is the last one. So the one of the key markers, I like how you frame the

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.350
story. But one of the key markers that when you're in a data centric is you're starting

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:11.490
to see insights being built and those insights becoming addictive. And an insight is really

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:18.290
nothing more than an unexpected relationship between two different data sets. That feels

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:23.810
good. I mean, it comes with euphoria to a little bit, a little bit of if I had a meeting,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.910
if there's a scientist in the three, could you please do a study on what happens chemically

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:35.200
in the brain when you have an insight? It's you found a discovery. It's it is fully addictive.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:43.630
It's like I get to play Easter egg hunts all day long with the data. What is lacking though

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.870
is great, you have an addiction around insights. But what is lacking is which of these are

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:57.160
interesting. I like the idea of that insights can be interesting or not interesting. And

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:07.160
it's the amount it makes you go, huh, or huh. For me, the you can tie it back. But what

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:15.320
really drives interesting is how easily and readily you could connect it to a useful business

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.480
KPI. And a useful business KPI is essentially does it help me grow? Does it help me earn

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:29.320
more revenue? Does it help me reduce costs? Does it help me reduce time? Those so if

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:38.420
you can connect the dots to something that the business as a whole cares about. It's

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:48.320
interesting. I have seen. So for example, last week I was sitting with one of our interns,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:54.960
and he drew together a history and talking about data science stuff like 80% of what

00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:00.920
I am doing nowadays is just pulling together histograms and interesting ways and looking

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:09.440
at the patterns. I know how to analyze histograms. A lot of PMs don't like when should you look

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:15.400
at the outliers? When should you not disclosure? I don't either. Yes, teach me. Okay, happy

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:21.440
to do this. I've seen histograms. I don't know if I can get an insight from one. You'll

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:29.520
be surprised. Once you play with histograms and you learn how to use them. I'll give

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:35.440
you an example. A lot of the histograms are head tail curves. You can do a simple

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:42.500
transformation of a head tail curve to turn it into a normal distribution. And that normal

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:52.570
distribution will give you a much greater detail of insight than the head tail distribution.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:35:01.510
The other thing with head tail distributions, generally there's between two to five times

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:06.510
additional whatevers depending on what the head tail distribution is measuring in the

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:13.330
tail than in the head. But almost everyone focuses on the head. So that's one of the

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:20.280
reasons why I will often convert it to a normal distribution, a bell curve distribution.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:29.110
Because it eases the seduction around, oh we must focus on the head. They're the customers

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:43.070
that everyone cares about. Where was it going? Hit a pothole. Oh, so this intern

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:56.790
drew together a histogram and he found that 80% of the results he was looking at was divisible

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:04.210
by five exactly. And he's like, does that bother you? And I tortured him on a bunch of questions

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:17.570
around. So one of the things for me, it is immediately initially interesting when it

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:27.050
doesn't line up with your expectation of the data. What makes it super interesting, I guess,

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:33.370
to try to disambiguate the term of interesting I used before is when you find a pattern that

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:38.930
you can connect the dots to a business KPI. But the first thing is if the data shows something

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:47.360
that you don't expect, that is something you should follow up on. Time box it. Don't get,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.680
because the other thing with these insight addictions, it can be a rabbit hole. It can

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:59.360
be something that gets sucked you into a spiral of figuring out, well why? Well why? Well

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:09.280
why? You always have to be able to have something in the back of your head of if I answer this

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:23.850
question why will I care? There's more on this topic. I think we can go into deeper,

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:30.130
like the Slack channel. One of the things I think our listeners have asked for is,

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:38.860
hey how do I get the execs to stop being stupid? Oh, let's do a whole episode 43 on how to stop

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.140
people, including execs, from being stupid. As you know, I don't know if you, I'll mention

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.100
this again in 43, but I once, been about 10 years since I first did this, but I once described

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:53.500
my job as I stop people from being stupid. I do less of that now, but it's still something

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.220
I've always done. Why do you do less of it now? That's a good question. Let's explore that.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:03.380
I'm pretty certain the amount of stupid people have not gone down. Maybe I just do it so subconsciously

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:09.710
now that I don't notice. Alright. That's what we're talking about. Thank you for listening.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:15.310
If you've made it this far, yes thanks. I'll thank you anyway. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. We'll

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.190
see you next time. Bye.
