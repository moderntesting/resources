00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:11.620
Welcome to AVE testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.500
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Happy New Year, Brent

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.200
Happy New Year to you Alan. Alright, if you're gonna type

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.020
do it while you're not talking don't type and talk at the same time because

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.100
Normally when you type during the podcast I can strip it out later

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.620
But if you're talking off strip out you're talking to you and in fact, I wonder if we should just do a podcast

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.380
Without you what that would be like

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.020
I don't know if I would have enough things to say because you inspire me so much anyway

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.740
as I was saying Happy New Year and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.560
Try and try and make my editing job a little easier if you would okay. Yeah, welcome to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.400
22 1 everyone. Oh

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.290
My god, yeah, we had this discussion last time I I want to talk about you know, I'm not big into

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.490
Gifts in this time here. In fact, we barely exchanged any gifts at all, but I bought myself some presents

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.460
one thing

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.620
Similar to Microsoft, you know Microsoft had a

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.020
What'd they call it?

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.980
What's the budget that paid for your gym membership?

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.030
You took Microsoft. What was that called?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.980
That's now called a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.860
Base health wellness something like that budget

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.860
We have a health wellness thing, but especially with the gyms all being closed

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.820
They got very lenient on what we're allowed to purchase with that allotment

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.500
Step counters or watches that do step counting are good. So I have a new you can see it in the oh

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.500
And the zoom which only brain can see but it's a nice new galaxy s3

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.100
I also picked up a set of the galaxy buds, which I really which is the their version of the air pods

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.220
I really really like I wear them all the time a lot of fun

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.660
So I'm pretty happy there. Those were my presents. I think I bought some about some

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.380
Shorts and stuff and it was pretty cool. That was my Christmas to myself or

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.940
holiday whatever

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.220
Flavor you wish to observe. Oh, oh and before I forget, you know

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.420
I'm just gonna put words in your mouth the whole time. Remember when you said that

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.540
Trump would win and America would burn and I said no Biden will win and America will burn and so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.140
I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.300
You were half right and I was entirely right

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620
Yeah, yeah

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.280
Yay America America. Hell yeah

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.280
Since we're waxing political

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
Just briefly briefly

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.210
The one is not people for pressing that fast-forward 30 seconds button too often. I will say

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300
That at this moment in time

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.730
I'm not a fan of Georgia. I think it is universally a bad thing in

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.770
In a world where there's a two-party system

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.090
where

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.490
One party has all of the power. I am fully confident that will change in two years

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.320
multiple things to disagree with there one is

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.800
we have a former president who is

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.630
Entirely at fault for losing all those things if he wouldn't have been such a shithead

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.590
Perhaps that wouldn't have happened

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.940
Second of all to do

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.510
Second of all

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.510
remember libertarian

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.630
Anytime you bash any of the parties I'm gonna wholly agree with ya. I know small. Yeah. Yeah, I get that but it's

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.870
Which again being a libertarian the two-party system is is I've got to watch my language here broken for you

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.070
I mean you can vote for your candidate, but you want you want more than anyone ranked choice voting

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.260
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.260
Unfortunately even having I mean Republicans do not want ranked choice voting

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.620
Look what it did to them in Georgia

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.270
Their candidates were ahead, but they had to have the runoff because they didn't get 50% and not exactly ranked choice

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.070
But but a variant of it their candidates were ahead and they had to have the runoff and their candidates got beat

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.550
Republicans do not want anything that remotely looks like ranked choice voting

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.230
Unfortunately electoral college anything to do with the Constitution

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.670
Voting like to rank choice voting is not gonna happen with the mere 50% of the Senate

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.510
So nothing's changing despite having one party in charge of all three things

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.270
But I mean, this is the way the system works if one party

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.350
craps all over the bed in Congress in the Senate in the house and the

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.310
Presidency, of course, they're gonna lose all three of those. It's inevitable. What's gonna happen as a result of it. Not a whole lot

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.170
unfortunately, I think I do not go to the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.950
Extremist I'll just teasing you of libertarianism. I never even considered myself a political party

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.350
Until I was called a libtard for believing everyone should be treated fairly

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.510
Whatever every time presidential election comes about and primaries come about I take the little quiz

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:43.390
Offered by so many sites that tells me which candidate I mostly align with and that's who I align with until I know they have

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.550
No chance of winning for whatever reasons. I don't care about identifying with the political party

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.390
but unfortunately the last four years I've been told by

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.470
People on the internet, of course that I belong to a party only because I think things should be fair

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.490
So that bugs me I don't care if you're libertarian Democrat communist Republican socialist, whatever

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.350
I just want to be able to vote for people who share the views of what I want to have happen to the environment

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.860
I live in. Yeah, no the issue already is that

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.700
that the

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.700
The way you've defined it

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.540
It's unknowable because the dip the each party has their own definition of what is fair

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.820
Right. That's that's the issue

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.390
From so from my perspective the the Democrat Party

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.270
they define

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:47.190
Fairness sort of from an equivalency of experience. Yeah, and again, I don't want to go into this

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.430
I I am NOT I'm not like yeah, Biden. He's gonna be awesome. I'm not in that camp

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.370
I'm in the camp of thank God the idiot is out of there the

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.570
senile

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.570
narcissistic

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:08.010
Homophobic racist idiot is out of the office and we could have somebody forgot misogynistic. I didn't forget it. I was just

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.650
Trying to trying to get on from the topic. But got it. Yeah, I I

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.050
Unfortunately, the painful part is I don't expect a big change

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.320
I do hope some things get better. That's the best I can hope for

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.080
so

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.140
Yeah, anything I got topics

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.040
I got like four topics written down on my notebook for us to fly through in an order

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.680
It topics that we have briefly mentioned to each other but not in an order you're expecting so

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160
You have some things you want to cover first before we get into the the meat and this is where we if you fast

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.720
Forwarded to here. We're almost ready to start go ahead

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.140
Right. The the only thing I'll cover is

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.580
Hey everyone, welcome to the the new year or the the first episode of the year

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.300
episode number 132

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.940
It is 132 and this is not an ad break because we're not breaking anywhere

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:10.820
But one thing I'm happy went seamless as far as I can tell without screwing anybody up is I

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.380
Migrated the podcast away from self hosting on angry weasel calm

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:23.180
You can't tell there's a 301 redirect that sends your RSS feed to anchor FM where our podcast is now hosted

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:30.920
It makes some things a little bit easier for us. We'll talk about those throughout the year one is I guess the main one is

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:40.120
I don't end up overflowing my allotted disk space because anchor will host it for free and they'll take care of all the stuff of

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.600
Propagating the podcast to whatever podcast

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:52.320
Site you'd like to download your podcast from so all that's cool in the longer term if and when we do have advertising

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.080
Or if we do have a listener

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.920
Sponsorship in any way they'll take a little cut of that which is why they do all that for free

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.200
But in the meantime, it's just free. We'll figure out all the rest as we go as we mentioned in 131

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.800
AB testing is an LLC. I

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.240
We collect any money I get from modern testing things related or Brent gets

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:21.480
Put it into our bank account that Brent doesn't have access to and we'll use that money for we're pretty set on equipment for now

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.760
But we can do we'll spend now that we don't have hosting costs

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.440
I guess we'll use that money for again for scholarships for things that come up things ways we can give back to the community

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.520
So that's my not and my ad not an ad anchor FM

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.360
Let's go ahead and get into the meat of the show should have like a theme that goes right here and

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.660
Then when people want to fast forward to a match start talking about things they care about

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.880
They know to listen for that music. I have podcasts where I do that. So

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.880
What I wrote down these one-word hints on what I was going to talk to you about

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.580
But now I can't tell what they say. Give me a moment

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:07.220
So the first thing is I can't remember if this was out when we did our last podcast or not

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.820
But I gave did we talk about my talk at test flicks? Yeah

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.940
I'm pretty sure we talked about you were about

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.500
To deliver it. Okay. Well, it was just a recording the idea was it's really cool

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.700
A hundred or so eight-minute talks they just didn't so you could binge on short test talks

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.100
I gave one on teaching developers how to test

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.560
Based on years of practice and experience nothing I've making up. It's all practical knowledge

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.000
things I mentioned on the podcast before it's I called the caring sharing and pairing or something like that, but

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:52.260
Pairing with them learning to coach them ask the right question teach them how to test I posted on LinkedIn

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.370
That my talk is now available

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.950
Lots of positive reactions positive comments and I got a few

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.250
Comments worth talking about here. I don't know if you're watching on Twitter for me to talk about this

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.670
So this may be all new for you. Did you observe any of this?

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:15.530
No, I saw I saw reference to it on the select channel. Yeah. Yeah

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.570
What yeah, what happened was

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.330
First off someone jumped on and said

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.450
This talk would be a lot more effective. We talked about what testing is

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.890
And I

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:40.010
To me, I mean that from a mile away is clickbait for the testing checking conversation

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:46.570
And that's where it went. Yeah, okay, and a couple people jumped all over it and

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.930
They posted the link to the checking versus testing article, which I want to talk about in a little bit

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.760
and

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.680
various other

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.420
B&B articles and I wasn't sure like I

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.700
Don't agree with these articles, but what relevance do they have and

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.660
What it came down to and I finally dug through the game of 20 questions

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.580
was

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.980
There was a belief among these folks and I know exactly where this comes from

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.460
But I want to get your opinion before we dive into it

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.180
Yeah, but the general belief was that if you think of

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:36.460
And again, I have to get I have to start ahead here. It's not testing versus checking. Of course

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.380
We've known for decades that some testing is purely

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.080
Confirmatory and some testing is investigative big

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.980
Whoop I get it to me. That's

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.580
Basic knowledge, I don't understand the excitement and glee over this distinction

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.000
But the gist of the feedback was that developers

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.720
programmers of code are

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.400
more or less

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.200
incapable of

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.240
Investigative testing they can only do checking or verification testing

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:17.000
Sure before I dive into that and some of the reasons people believe that way and when my reactions to that

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.120
I'd like to leave that part for some feedback from my trusted colleague

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.820
That's you Brett. Oh

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.900
I'm like, oh we have a guest today

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.900
So it's interesting you're asking me this question, you know just coming out of the holidays

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.820
I've drained all of all

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.460
Spent the last four weeks draining all of my hatred levels

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.860
And willingness to go into Hulk mode on stupidity

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.980
so, you know, it's it's

00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:01.650
It means I'm able to refill that battery in this particular case. I'm coming from a more empathetic place

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:10.290
Right the testing versus checking discussion. This is I'm gonna go I'm gonna do a drive a psychological answer

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:15.410
right the that conversation and the tenant that

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.840
That

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.000
devs are incapable of

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.320
Doing this work

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:30.680
Right that that's where testing versus checking comes from that that's that's the point of that conversation. It's not a semantic one

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.760
It's it's one built around

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.820
Cementing

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.660
that

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:47.060
Separation of this work into a special specialized discipline is critical

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:54.430
right and as as I'm sure your talk called out even in the face of

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.270
data and evidence that

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.270
shows the contrary

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.550
Which at this point in time like this argument has been out for what two decades?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:11.630
Right. There is so much. It doesn't take any effort at all to find evidence on the internet to the contrary here

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.990
so to me this is this is

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.040
Testing versus checking is

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.220
Is a belief system? It's a religion?

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.020
It's not

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.020
bounded in

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.010
in any sort of evidence based

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:38.850
System structure and it's it's an EQ argument

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:44.010
It's essentially I need people to hold this to be true

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:49.650
True because that's how I protect my identity

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.700
There you go. So I'm trying to find the right quote here and I'll edit out my keystrokes later

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.220
Yes, and yes, I think

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.820
it really comes down to

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.340
See if I can I have a story in my head here. I want to weave

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.340
I want to see if I can make it happen

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.340
The argument is a lot about those other people can't do my job

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:20.430
Which is really it's a flavor of my job is unique. I'm a specialist

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.150
We need specialists. I'm a snowflake specialist. My job's not going away

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.870
If it if if these things aren't distinct my job loses meaning

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.880
Right which comes back to I in one of the discussions on Twitter

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.680
What am I there's this one person that follows me on Twitter?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.360
Every time he comes out

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.000
I know he's gonna go down one of these paths and I forget what I was talking about and he

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.560
his comment was and I

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.180
Think he meant to push my buttons, but I don't really care but he said

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.180
Alan I'm sure you were an expert at some things but you were not an expert at testing

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.900
And I said I wouldn't claim myself to be an expert at anything

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.900
I do have you know, I do have a lot of experience but a lot of practical experience and

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.190
And then later he or in that same thread he pointed out like for example

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:20.630
I don't think what you're doing with modern testing is doing any favors for testing. I'm completely paraphrasing

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.390
I know he won't listen to the podcast and it reminded me

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:31.560
It reminded me that the modern testing principles as we've said aren't modern. They aren't about testing

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.780
But Brent and I began talking about modern testing not to invent something

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:44.100
Not to talk about something new. We wanted to see people do it was not aspirational

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.860
It was talking about things that we were already

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.300
seeing

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.060
Yes, and how can you be against the notions?

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:59.980
I have in pushing things away or we have with modern testing when modern testing is just and

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.460
Which goes back to the whole this ties together with the

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:11.620
Please protect my job and differentiate checking versus testing. It's important for me because we started off talking about the podcast

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.820
Sex coming up on seven years ago

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.100
Because we wanted to talk about the changes that we were already

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:26.620
Seeing and give people some knowledge and mental tools and ideas to help navigate that change

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:33.310
Shoving your head under a rock for anything does not help

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.270
The the thing that you're saying hey modern testing is not doing anything for testing

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.300
We've we've had that conversation before I don't recall

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:50.440
Like on most things on this topic. I can have great confidence that we are at least 90% aligned

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.220
But when it comes to testing I'll state my view up front in

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.170
No way shape or form am I trying?

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.010
to help testing

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.800
What I am trying to do is help

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.800
number first and foremost is help improve the state of

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.720
quality in the world quality is and and

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.800
for the rest of my life

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.640
Going to be a

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:28.280
Important concern I grew up in tests, but right as as Whitaker one of my favorite snappy quotes is

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.160
All of this testing is getting in the way of quality

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.480
100% agreed I have

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.360
Very little interest in in any sort of thing of trying to protect testing. Okay, I

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.380
am

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.900
trying to

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.500
Grow and improve quality and I am

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:58.420
Trying to grow and improve the lives of those folks in a peer testing role and

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.740
Say look you don't have to follow us. You don't have to believe in these principles

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.760
But if there's anything we can ask you to do is

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.880
Look behind the curtain and

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.720
Observe what's there instead of what you believe is there?

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.120
Or as you put it get your head out from underneath the rock

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.160
Because the world has changed

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.960
So that aside and I can't find the quote so I'm gonna paraphrase it but one of Bolton's articles

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.440
I thought it was the one on checking versus testing

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.960
But after a while the articles all kind of read the same, but it makes

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.240
a point that I I'm actually writing an

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.200
Article on this to read to indirectly rebut this passively aggressively about this. There's a point he makes

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.680
Some

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.200
That I think is the gist of the problem here

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.750
Paragraph in question reads something like

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.870
when I'm

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:11.470
Developing software or writing this article as he says I'm in a builder's mindset

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:18.360
when I'm deeply testing or when I'm deeply investigating software, I'm in a

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.430
testers mindset and

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:27.830
Changing between these two mindsets is possible but extremely difficult and

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:35.590
And some other adjective as I read that it just didn't feel right and it reminded me

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:41.110
I like I was one of the first people to read mindset when it came out the idea that there is a growth mindset

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:48.030
And a fixed mindset. Yeah, and that took me back to of course Drucker came up with the term knowledge worker

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.150
But it reminded me, you know, Dan pink is famous for Drive

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:56.610
But the book if I believe the one right before that called a whole new world or something

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:01.430
It's about it's really about the rise of knowledge workers in the industry when I read that

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:08.430
I realized that all these arguments folks are making about well testing is very special because you have to think and learn at the same

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.150
time and all these little things like that all described

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.110
Knowledge work I realized Oh software testing software development

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:22.470
They're just knowledge work and they require to be good at them. It requires a growth mindset

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:29.940
What I believe has been confused in this in the definition of this article

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:37.940
I just I discussed on checking versus testing is checking is it a builder a builder and a tester are not separate

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.220
mindsets they're separate skill sets and

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.160
while they may require a mental shift I

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:54.240
Have seen enough and I'm talking about dozens if not hundreds of people who can pretty seamlessly shift between

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.780
building and evaluating and investigating whatever it is they're doing at the same time I

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:06.200
I honestly cannot count the number of people who can do that in a moment's notice without a

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.240
Without even a conscious shift it takes practice. Yeah

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:16.760
I know plenty of developers and I've been there myself where you get that tunnel vision you stop thinking about how things are going to work

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.920
But it doesn't take much to knock me out of it. I'm not even near the best in doing this

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.640
So I sort of fundamentally disagree that it requires a huge

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.160
Effort to shift from a builder's mindset to a tester's mindset

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.760
I believe those are skill sets and the more fluent you are on each skill

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.820
The more fluid you can be and moving between them accurately. I'm curious what your take is on that

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.450
So I'm absolutely in agreement

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.960
That on on builder versus testing like in the in the

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.680
An allergy where he talks about his blog post

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320
Right. I think of it as

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.940
You know writer versus editor. Okay, and

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:14.320
And I think although the myriad blog posts I've written or the docs I've done okay. Yeah

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:25.100
In any way shape or form do I believe that I cannot I cannot fulfill

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.220
The editor role on my own content

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.150
No, I absolutely can

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.470
Does it benefit from an objective observer?

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:44.990
You bet right? So for example, like you've seen my blog posts. I am NOT known for my Tersody

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.560
right and

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.200
If I had an editor, I'm fairly certain that like hey this

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.560
15 page paragraph you wrote and couldn't you express the same thing in three sentences

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.870
Right and it's that requires more effort

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:07.240
It does it does but if you hire an editor and that's sort of their job, right? They'll provide that effort

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.410
however, if you don't care

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.640
like in the case of a blog post

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.290
I'm not the best of my ability. I'm not gaining or losing

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.330
readers and and actually gaining or losing readers aren't even a goal the goal was

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.360
Get my ideas out on the internet, right? The

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.580
There are people that I have observed

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.540
that have a

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:45.670
They have a preference to stay tightly focused and if you ask them to change their focus

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.370
They can do it

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:54.970
But it's gonna take them time because once they're in a deep focus, it's hard to move over to me. That is a

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.850
symptom of being more of a fixed mindset than a growth mindset I

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:08.170
So that part of it I agree with you as well, but here I'm talking about something even deeper. It's essentially

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:16.440
So there are multiple ways to carve humanity often that into polar opposites, right? And in this particular one I

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.400
Have found that there are two types of folks obviously

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:28.360
Ones that have a preference to see all the details and then and then sort of build things up

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:36.680
Figure out okay. I got all these details. What does that mean? Okay, the other ones and here's where I think you and I align

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:42.840
Elton is we're more top-down. Hey, what's the goal? What's the goal? We're trying to achieve? Okay

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:49.100
How do we break that down and a lot of times our approach will lead while we're missing a bunch of stuff now

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.980
Are we then go? Oh, that's a get the fill. Let's get that funded blah blah blah

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.920
And in this case, I'm not gonna dispute that Mike

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:04.820
Has has a challenge flipping between these these mindsets or skill sets

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.160
Right if and I think in both cases it starts being a mindset

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.200
And my point is I think probably a lot of people have a problem. It's difficult to switch between those

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:23.480
It is a learned skill and if you practice it again as with some of the growth mindset as you should do

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.320
The more you do it the better you'll get at it. It's it's not it's not a fixed

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:34.680
Oh, this is always gonna take 15 minutes for me to do to a lot of work. I need to just stay in my in my niche

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.440
Yes

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.440
Here I am reminded of

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.840
When one way I used to describe my two boys

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.920
okay, and

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.240
The on certain topics my oldest

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.840
He very much identifies with what he is

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.220
What he is today and and there's an underpinning theme to him

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.180
That that's what he will always be

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.080
okay, and

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.680
He would go you can't tell me

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.880
You can't tell me that I can do this because I've never tried it before so he pivoted on these new experiences

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.530
He pivoted pessimistically up front my middle son pivots the other way

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.880
You can't tell me that I can't do this because I've never done it

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.600
but and so here I actually viewed that is probably more of a

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.990
of

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:38.850
Basically how your brain is is wired up front if you're a if you're a pessimist

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:43.430
And this is a hypothesis if you're a pessimist you may view

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.930
That

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.600
It's impossible

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.600
Whereas you and I go

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.800
We're more on change agents

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:59.040
Yeah, I picking something up and going a whole new direction is something we do on a daily basis

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.600
Is it pessimism versus optimism or just fixed mindset versus growth mindset?

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:11.500
It might be it might be fixing and growth right? I think that actually more aligns with the story I was saying

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.660
Yeah, I just don't like the idea that these

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.180
arbitrary things are mindsets

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:22.380
I do believe the mindset is one where you're and I believe all good knowledge workers are

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:28.660
On the growth mindset side of things. It's difficult to be a knowledge worker if you're a fixed mindset

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:34.030
So but the skill sets the ability to shift gears

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:42.190
Between different skill sets that you have that is difficult, but it is a learned quality and that's my point

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.030
Yeah, but I do think again

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.110
Where you stand

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.520
intrinsically upfront

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.800
Plays into it like one of my favorite Henry Ford quotes is

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.160
Whether you think you can or you think you can't

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.400
You're right

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:13.160
Yep, hundred percent hundred percent. Anyway, I I've been working an article for that. It's almost done. I thought about

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.060
You know, I should do a blog post again

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.700
Longer tangents on that on what we do with modern testing org

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.720
but in the short term, I'm doing an article for a

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:32.320
Test tool company. I said I do one for their website and they said I could write an opinion piece and I have this one

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.480
I have another one. I'm working on that. We'll talk about another time. I

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.080
Think maybe in 2021. I'll do a little bit more writing besides the five for Fridays. I think I'll find a

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.040
venue for that and get that going I

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:51.190
Love the five for Friday. So don't drop that. I got one coming out today. I got some I talk about my buds

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:57.230
I got some other things in there too, which I'm sure I'll get to so the other thing

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.590
I wanted to talk about and if you're on one of the three dot slack comm

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.750
Which costs exactly zero dollars to join

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:11.790
Maybe we should charge a dollar a year. No people wouldn't join. It's free. It will always be free

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:15.190
I posted a little bit of information about

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:21.230
Project delivery in my organ grants been busy and didn't get a chance to reply

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.630
But I just thought it was interesting and inspired some good some good feedback

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:30.550
But I think you'll have a different kind of feedback because of course you've helped me on the stuff before maybe about a year ago

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:35.550
exactly, but as you all know part of my job is

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.210
Managing delivery program management figuring out

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:46.070
Keeping track of dependencies between projects. Of course. I have a team now to do this as my org has grown

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.580
But looking at delivery what I want to do is make sure that

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.700
Maybe we haven't talked about the way we do estimates in my org

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:01.000
Estimates, of course is predicting the future. So maybe I should start with that one rule we have is

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.620
only

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:08.420
Only the dev leads only the dev team and the dev leads in particular can give an estimate for a date

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.980
product management isn't allowed to say how does

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:20.200
January 21st look or can you have a stomach January 21st? They get absolutely no say in the date of our estimate

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.220
is it absolutely no say

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.740
no say in the

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:30.700
One exception if we have something like GDPR where we have a deadline

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:37.340
Then they get to say but 99.9% of the time we avoid using the word deadline

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.970
So only devs can give estimates

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:45.170
the the next step which you're gonna wonder how do you ever ship is

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:50.970
We asked for a p50 estimate meaning is a 50% probability. They'll hit that date

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.410
Where does that come from? It is a balance between

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:03.410
Putting some thought into what you're doing before you begin to build it and not over planning my experience is that

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:09.490
If you go for a date, you have 50% confidence level in you're probably not gonna over plan

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:14.410
but you're probably gonna put some thought into what you're doing before you start and of course the

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:21.170
The Hubbard book how to measure anything. I have my own copy is a very good book

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:24.410
on deep diving into how well

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:29.210
Confidence levels which is what these are having a confidence level about

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:36.010
When something will be done will help you and and he has a brilliant chapter on

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.850
Exactly

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.130
Why you are doing what you're doing? Yeah

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:47.930
So p50 estimates by the dev team and then if they miss a date and someone called me out like every time like half

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.690
the time they're gonna miss a date, but our teams do retros pretty regularly, but

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:57.170
We ask if they're late on a date or even ridiculously early that in their retro

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.870
They cover that like what what didn't we know that we know now?

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:05.250
I look for output from those retros if the date is off by more than 20%

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:10.830
Just so I can look for general advice. I can give the org. So that's it. They give dates

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.810
they hit him or they don't in fact, they miss them half the time and

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.910
We try and learn from that. So given the size of our org and the size of our projects. Yes

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.630
Do they actually miss them half a time? Yep

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:28.110
Almost exactly so p50 are pretty good on right now our p50 as far as delay is that is one day?

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:34.600
For the year so half of our projects are done in one day or miss their date by one day

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:41.340
Half or or less half missed by one day or more. Okay. Good question though

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:48.820
I don't know if I put that in the data I posted there. So we finished about 350 projects across our org in 2020 and

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.700
a project worth defining is a

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.300
Chunk of work. It has to have a customer outcome or a customer impact

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.960
So it has to be it can be anything from available to customers

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.140
We'll track the rollout a little bit differently or it can be as small as an experiment

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:12.560
Where we may do something and then not go any farther because the experiment failed. So we track all those things and

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.560
One exception internal projects like something that's affecting some other team trying to get a customer deliverable

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.400
We track those because we want to be able to track dependencies and things like that. So

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.400
350 of those through the year

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.720
The range was anywhere from five days to five months on the estimate. Of course

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.300
My advice to teams is to try and make things shorter

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.300
anecdotally and historically I've seen six weeks as

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:46.260
Sort of a sweet spot as the as the upper limit because it's big enough to do something significant and small enough to see

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.220
the end from the beginning

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.220
definitely

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:56.840
Try and push things smaller if I can some projects end up being bigger because they can't have a customer outcome until more work's been

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.840
Done that's expected

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.020
originally, I had a goal of

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:06.060
Set while I had a goal that 75% of our projects would be six weeks or less

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:12.340
That p75 actually ended up being closer to eight and a half weeks as far as the delivery numbers go

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.940
This is where the interesting stuff came in

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.300
projects from one to three weeks

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:23.500
Huge sweet spot 97% of the projects that were originally estimate of that length of time shipped on time

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:29.000
Another almost the entire amount of the rest of them were within a week

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.260
That was it like if that was the project size

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:39.060
You were gonna be golden. We were closer on projects from three weeks to a month where

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:46.820
64% were on time and the mass but the the mass remainder of those were also only a week late

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.110
Okay, and just to be clear on time means on time or earlier, right?

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.850
No, actually we tracked on time because when I get that p50, right?

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.990
I want to make sure people weren't padding

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:05.990
So if someone was it was two weeks early on a project, I actually count that as a missed estimate. Okay, got it

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:11.810
So what's interesting is I have data for everything from a month and longer

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.930
But guess I think you have the data in front of you

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:19.370
But of our projects that were a month or longer and remember up to a month

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.630
65% on time a month or longer

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.160
Exactly zero projects shipped on time

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.780
What some so your other category was?

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:35.070
21 to 30 days and there are multiple months

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:42.680
That fit in 30 days. So what is there are multiple months that have 30 days? Yes

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.540
Yes, there are. Thank you. Good. I'm glad we're

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.740
Projects don't necessarily align on a month. So I'm not sure. No, I know I'm trying to so

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:58.180
What I'm trying to distinguish in my head you said over a month. So when you when you say over a month

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.740
What exactly do you mean? You mean 31 days or longer? Okay. All right

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.040
Got it

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.660
One thing if we bring Hawthorne effect in here

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:12.820
It it when or I shared this with the team and of course by doing that

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:20.860
I have wrecked that one to three week estimate because people will try and fit their estimates in there because they know they'll be on time and

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:26.590
Inevitably, they won't be they won't if I tell you that

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:32.790
If you're if you're what if your estimate is within one to three weeks, it's very likely to be on time

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:37.950
Wouldn't you as a dev lead in charge of that estimate think well, I said four weeks

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.950
But if I make it three weeks, it'll be on time

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.870
Yeah, there's a

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.660
Yeah, if they go that way

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.740
Yeah, you were on the risk right is

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.380
right cuz then

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.530
Yeah, if instead though they say

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:03.670
Hey, if it goes beyond four weeks, maybe I shouldn't

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:10.190
Entirely trust myself and rethink this that might that would be a beneficial output here

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:17.670
But yeah, if they take the intellectual lazy approach, yeah, I expect to see I don't think they'll be fun to call out

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:21.990
Yeah, that I may I may skew future data by showing current data

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:28.390
Yeah, that this is one of the reasons why I like Fibonacci sequences and plenty poker though

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.990
Right at your data

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:37.350
Because it was run as a semi objective experiment. It doesn't surprise me that it kind of aligns with

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:41.750
The the reasoning behind that that the bigger the project

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.270
the the more

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.710
you actually

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:52.550
Don't really know the estimate because it's too much complexity for

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.700
people to handle up upfront and

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:04.420
And also the bigger the project the more likely there's there's going to be the the oh shit gotcha in the middle

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.900
Discovered in the middle that wasn't planned for well the interesting

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:14.940
statement I can make going forward because we have new projects start every week and

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:22.700
Things the way we track stuff is when we commit to something like we're gonna do this or we say active planning has begun

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:29.800
That is a planning phase that the result of that is it is the project moves from planning into in progress

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.540
And there's a date assigned to it or that p50 estimate is done

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:39.460
The purpose of our planning is to be able to come up with the p50 estimate. That's the output of our planning process

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.690
Okay

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:45.930
Last year we had roughly a some glance again numbers here a third

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:52.890
Little less of our maybe a third or so of our projects were original estimate was six weeks or longer

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.720
Knowing what I know now

00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:03.020
I know every single one of those p50 estimates is wrong actually the I can go farther than that because by

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.500
definition almost every single p50 estimate is wrong

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:13.680
but I know when you have the longer the project is I know this anecdotally as many of us have forever is

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.120
Your as your longer estimates are more likely to be wrong

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:24.080
I have some significant data now that shows me that your longer estimates are wrong

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:30.570
So the work then is not to just acknowledge that and pad that I don't want them to pad it. I think

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:36.890
Remember my goal of p50 estimate is I think it's the sweet spot between

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.490
knowing enough to get going and not over planning I

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:47.010
think my takeaway is on these larger projects that they are being under planned a little bit and

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:54.210
It's a fine line because it's certainly possible to over plan these things and still miss the date

00:41:54.690 --> 00:42:00.530
But from the retro stuff I have I do know that those dates are being missed because of an unrecognized dependency

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.650
Even simple things like not taking vacations or holidays into account

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.290
When you do the original estimate

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.930
Right in and of course with a longer estimate that's more of a risk

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:16.850
Absolutely one of the things though. It's interesting that you concluded that that there's insufficient planning

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:24.050
Because I don't think that I honestly don't think that's the case because even if you spent the extra time on planning

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:31.370
Shit changes I can tell cuz again I get I get information from a retro on anything

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:38.090
It's more than 20% over the original estimate and it really comes down to didn't account for some risk

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:43.090
Whether that risk could have been known up front is questionable

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.010
But we did but basically comes down to why was it late?

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:53.530
We didn't account for some risk or some set of risks right and the larger the project the more likely of

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:58.970
That being the case is true, right? Because you can't you don't know what's gonna happen

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:03.130
I don't I'm having so many meetings this week where I don't remember what I said in December

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:06.570
That I don't know how I would ever manage a six-week project

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.030
Yeah, it could be age could be age. I was gonna say wait till you get to be my age

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.890
It just gets worse Alan. Yeah, remember I'm older than you

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.030
Only physically correct

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.510
but I'm curious about is I

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:29.930
Don't think moving forward with this idea that these things are being under

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:37.090
Under planned is is the right way to go. Why was it not your your initial statement saying?

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:39.730
Hey, these guys need to work

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.450
through how to

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:50.530
These ones with the larger projects, how do we keep the aspect that is something that still has customer impact

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.010
but so does

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:57.230
Really start to scale back on the internal definition of an MVP

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:02.770
Yeah, it could be some of that too to be clear what I what I meant by under planned

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.330
It's just again because I have that data from retros. It's

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.130
They're missing

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:13.450
Recognizing risks some of which could be done during the planning phase of the project

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:20.130
But absolutely a bigger thing to work on or at least an equal thing to work on with the team is how to take this

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:26.770
Eight this 10-week project and break it down into multiple pieces that each can have a customer outcome

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:34.770
Or a customer impact right right the one thing I really like about what you've done here is you allow

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:45.260
different projects to take different time ranges, right one of the things that's a problem with with Kanban a lot of times

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:50.540
Right is they want each ticket to have a customer outcome and take no more than two weeks

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:56.620
well, sometimes I mean I've in it hasn't it occurs rarely but

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.130
That can be a challenge. It can be a full

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.770
half-day planning event figuring out

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:08.250
What to cut what the scope out in order to make a two-week timeline

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.990
Right and and then it walk you walk away with

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:17.970
But all we're doing is we're splitting the work between two tickets because we're gonna do both of this work

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:22.250
Ticket number one is gonna be this and ticket number two is gonna be that so

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:28.110
Why did we even spend all this planning time? Yeah, I don't want I don't want this to be gained like that

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:33.470
And I don't know if you've read shape up the book by base camp. It's nope it is

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:41.230
Good, but I think too prescriptive one of the things they mandate that book what's worked for them

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:46.230
Which is great. And again, I don't think they're pushing it because everyone's context is different take it with a grain of salt

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.230
but their stance is

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.390
Every project is six weeks long

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.710
That that's a horribly brief summary of the book

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:59.990
I think there is a lot to that because anecdotally I found there's a pretty good sweet spot at six weeks for making a

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.270
Significant impact and being able to hit those dates, but

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.470
my data shows that a little shorter is better and

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.470
what and again, like you said what I found is

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:16.510
When we're sometimes we have to do longer projects and it's the length is fine there

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:20.990
I do I am gonna push again this year to get the

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:29.230
bulk of the projects get that p75 or p80 number of project length to be under six weeks or six weeks or under

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:33.310
Maybe even less but with with with your data

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:42.210
Like I'd be pushing for three weeks. I think I could do p50 at three weeks

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.860
I have to think about this. I have to float it around for all in my head, but

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.740
Anyway, but the interesting thing is is I've mentioned

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.460
probably on this podcast

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.660
years ago

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.860
When I was at Microsoft and doing we didn't call it DevOps

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:07.740
Basically when I ran DevOps for teams is that I never had as much control over quality is when I ran this infrastructure and tools team

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:12.820
As I did ever in a quality manager or test architect or quality position

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.420
what I've discovered in the last 18 months is

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:22.980
Never have I had more control and more influence on quality for our customers

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.420
then when I

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.940
was in charge of

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:33.170
Infrastructure tools analysis and delivery of our software products

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:40.050
It's fascinating. I think it's part. I think delivery is part of quality. I think I

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.420
Didn't have to get a new skill set or change

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.620
Mindset in order to do this

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:53.220
I just had to care about quality be not be afraid to learn and try new stuff and it's been a fascinating little journey

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.500
You had to apply

00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:03.740
Your existing mindset to a new problem. Sure. Yes, exactly it. It's thinking which by the way is

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.980
You may have heard this

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.980
This is where new ideas come from

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.860
Favorite authors

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.820
Where good ideas come from from Steven?

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.640
What's Steven's last name? Oh

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.120
something Steven, dude

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.440
Yeah, we're good ideas come from you look that up a very good book

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.560
I've read his entire catalog Johnson Johnson Stephen Johnson

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.320
Who I got to meet once like I have his autograph on a book somewhere. Oh

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.390
sweet

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:41.070
That was one of the advantages working at Microsoft as he actually had

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:45.030
Sort of industry luminaries just show up and give free talks

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.710
Yeah, I I mean I have a book at home

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.710
by Daniel Kaufman who's a

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:58.350
Nobel laureate and I have his I have an autograph book by him, right?

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.780
Yeah, I I miss that actually

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.980
Not HR

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:12.780
It was research MSR MSR. Yeah MSR. They had this recurring series and it was for me

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:18.700
It was fantastic because they it actually didn't even matter who was coming and talk

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.100
because

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.380
because

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:28.500
New ideas come from old ideas coming together and and it was a one one hour a month

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:34.660
Where I would be swimming in a pool of ideas. I may or may not have ever heard of before

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:42.380
I'm surprised that Microsoft isn't doing like regular teams events with those folks, but sure during pandemic

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.540
like we've had a lot of guest speakers everything from

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.300
inspirational speakers to

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:52.700
Magicians and musical groups and comedy comedians

00:49:53.540 --> 00:50:00.900
Give like zoom calls. They're like once a month. We have a big zoom meeting with all kinds of fun entertainment

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.020
There might be teams doing that

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.620
They're not inviting me

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:13.860
And as you well know that could be for entirely different reasons I can I can probably put in a good word for you

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.120
I did a science team. Oh

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.680
Sure

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.570
Stocks at 146. Oh, I forgot you guys went public

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.810
Yeah, I

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:35.090
Hope you're not looking at the Microsoft stock. I'm not okay that that's probably good for your sanity. Is it super high?

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.920
Yeah, just last five years. I wonder I wonder what my I don't remember how many options

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.600
I left on the table when I left what was the date that you left? Oh

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:52.080
It was almost exactly four years ago Barack Obama and I both quit our jobs on the same day

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.980
So January 17th

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.500
January 17th. Yeah

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.020
So far the stock has only gone up

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:09.970
Four times since that all right, it's came I'd be I'd be dead if I wouldn't have survived

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:15.650
I think you would have I don't think I would have survived

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.800
You are absolutely you're right. You know what? I'm gonna practice my EQ. You're right it turned into

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:28.200
This horrible mess that you tell them if they give me all my stock back

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.360
I'll come back for six months just long enough for it to vest and then I'll quit again

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.780
Yeah

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:39.500
You're not at 55. So you'd probably wait. I am. Oh, are you now?

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.620
I'm at the magic age. I if I would have stayed till now I could have quit and been rich. I

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:48.940
Thought you were only three years older than me. No, I just turned double nickel in December

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:53.420
Just before our last podcast. I'm sure we talked about this. No, we did

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.460
I'm I'm about to turn 51

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:03.060
But for some reason I had in my head that you were three years old or not four now. I was born in 65

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.700
Now aren't them?

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:11.500
Let's let's call it a day good good round of topics. Thanks for listening in

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:17.780
I'm gonna go off to my next meeting but a good seeing you happy new year. Happy new year to the three happy to have you

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:18.980
on board

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:25.220
One of the three dot one of the three dot slack calm. There's an invite up on modern testing org

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:30.340
I think that's it. All right. Thanks break. See you. Bye everyone
