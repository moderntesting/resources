00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.140
Good morning. Hello. For whatever time you're listening, I guess good morning is presumption something.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.140
You should listen in the morning. Okay, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're here for episode 70...72! 72.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.200
Of A-B testing and probably now because we have no strict agenda, I want to pre-plug 73,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.200
which will be our annual Reflections and Predictions episode.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.200
Yep. I have to go back and look, find last year's episode and write down what our predictions were.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
Well, I think the predictions got cut off because that recording went to shit.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.330
Oh. If I remember right. So then I have to go back and make up what our predictions were.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Yeah, exactly. I think I predicted there would be exactly 73 shows.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:06.550
It's one of the shows that actually requires prep from both of us. It requires some pre-thinking.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.550
So it's kind of fun. So that episode will be way better than this one. I'm pretty sure.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.550
If you downloaded both, I would just skip this one probably.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.710
Yeah. I mean, in general, it's a good idea.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.710
One of my employees came up to me just two days ago and said,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.710
Hey, I listened to your podcast. I said, Oh, which episode? One. I said, Oh, don't start with one. That one's awful.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.710
Well, I'm sure it gets better.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.940
Exactly. There's only a couple I think is that are worse than one.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.940
And I forget we have always one for sure.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:59.160
There was one. I can't remember one time in the Slack group, one of the three dot Slack dot com.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
You can DM me on Twitter and I'll add you. One time in that channel, we had a discussion of like,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.260
what's the best episode to start on? I think it was somewhere in the thirties, forties.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.350
You don't have to look at it. It's okay. You can go all the way back. It's cool.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.800
I want to. I want to. I want to. I thought it was like in the sixties, but yeah, it was there was a there was a dispute.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.800
It could have been 60. Yeah. Now, I mean, it depends on the context. Like we've been we've been doing this, what, four years now.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.800
No coming up on our four year anniversary. Yeah. In April. I'll bring flowers.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.800
The industry has changed. And we've changed. Why the bit? It would be in a perfect world where I retired tomorrow.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.800
Maybe I'd go back from the day job. I still keep podcasting till I till I die on the air.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:57.800
But I would like to sort of plot our progression. You'd have to die after you finish editing. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:07.800
Plotting our progression. Like how have our views changed? Like what is what has been the the made a story of A B testing over the last three point seven two years.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:16.800
That's a good topic for next episode. That requires way more. The episodes have horrible titles, which Brandon's promised to fix someday.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.020
But there are short descriptions there. Maybe I'll maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll try to see if I come up in the mid story of the story of A B testing.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:36.340
I think we'll find that they haven't changed much. We firmed it up things. We've created language like modern testers.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.050
I think I think we used to talk much more about testing and we talked much more about quality now. That's my my hunch.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.050
My prediction for the prediction show. What I'll come up with.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:55.050
If you replay when we started this, the majority of our listeners and I think it's no longer true. The majority of our listeners were internal to Microsoft.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:04.050
Yeah, that is no longer true. And we were talking about to at least half of the members of the A B podcasting testing crew no longer work at Microsoft.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:23.540
It's true. When we started this, we were talking about this as I recall, we're talking about the similar things, but the context was different because then Microsoft was going to undergoing the transformation and that we are now seeing the rest of the world undergoing.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.310
That's how I kind of view it.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.920
I don't view it that way because there was a there were a lot of companies going under that transformation and then Microsoft then did it mostly wrong.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:47.370
And we talked about that a lot and they've sort of bounced back. A lot of the big changes around it's not HR, but around organization or yeah, I'll call it organization.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:56.780
How to organize a team have been very Microsoft. My experience was very much a pendulum shifting like it was all in on one of the other.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:08.450
It was OK, every testers in Estet and then 10 years later, OK, every tester is a developer without exploring the path of the pendulum.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:18.580
How you get from one extreme to the other. I would say when we first started, I think a lot more of our discussions were around agile.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:49.780
We should we still talk about that a great deal. The other aspect is back then we were expressing an element of fearlessness around the change, but now it's a lot more around validation because back then we were like, no, we don't know where we're going, but we do know everything will be fine because we see the system.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:58.850
We see the patterns and now we can look back and go. Yeah, we were right. So let's let's talk even more about that next time.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.850
You have questions about that ping us on Twitter or if you're in the Slack channel, ping us there and we can dive deeper in there.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.850
But let's spend a little bit of time on that next time. Yeah, so it is December getting towards the end of the year.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:19.710
I am off to Moscow on Tuesday speaking at the Heisenberg conference. Looking forward to it.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:29.940
I'm confident it will be a good conference because they are very what's the word I should use particular. They follow up a lot.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:39.100
They asked for I gave him my slides, which I'm giving. I mentioned last time giving two talks, a track talk and the closing keynote.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.450
And I will definitely adapt the closing keynote based on what I see during the week.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:07:01.510
But for giving a talk on the abuse and misuse of test automation, which will be largely interactive because when I if I do a track talk and I actually rarely do track talks and I will get up in my pedestal and I'm too I'm just too freaking old to do track talks most of the time.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.510
But since I'm already there for the keynote and they're paying my way there and they're taking me on a tour of Moscow, I figure I owe them a little payback.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:17.510
I'm very much I would feel bad if I said no, although they did ask me to do a tutorial as well. I said no to that because I do limit out on things.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:25.510
Anyway, when I give a track talk, I make sure it's largely interactive, one for two main reasons.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:33.510
One is I think there is more learning that happens if you can get people involved and get them to interact. So we will design some tests.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.510
We will write some test automation, kind of predicting what they will write. And now I've written it already.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.510
But we'll use the numbers app.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.510
I was going to ask, are you going to give everyone their own copy of numbers?

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.510
Numbers is on my slide deck and I'll put it up in the show notes or on my blog.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:55.510
But it is up on GitHub. You can just go to github.com, angryweasel. It's all there. You can look at it.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.510
But the main reason, maybe the second reason, maybe not the main reason, main reason is learning.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:05.510
The second reason is because I just don't want to talk for an hour if I don't have to.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:14.900
The last track talk I gave was maybe five years ago at a star. And James Whitaker came to my talk just sitting in the back, you know, watch.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.900
I don't know why he was there. And he comes up to me afterwards and he goes, I can't do the James Whitaker draw.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.150
He goes, dude, you had the audience give the whole talk.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:31.220
And I said, yeah, that's my jam.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.220
So I think conferences are a great place to learn from each other.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:41.220
So if I can facilitate that versus me reading off some bullet points, then that's much better.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.340
So what they freaked out about is, hey, you only have like 14 slides for this hour long talk.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.570
I said, yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah, it might be too many.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:59.570
So the difference is, and it's just a difference in approach, is for a track talk, I'm planning on interacting.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.570
We're going to have a few slides. We're going to talk a lot.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:10.570
And in fact, I will do a tutorial, a workshop on web testing tools at star east in May.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:20.210
May. And I will probably have 20 slides for a four hour workshop because it's all it's interactive and demonstrations.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.210
And we're going to do stuff together with hands on when I do a keynote.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.530
My keynote is like 50 slides. Really?

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.530
I use a lot of slides. Some you only see for about five seconds.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.530
Some I'll park on and talk about for two or three minutes.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.530
But I use a lot of slides for a keynote.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.530
I don't think I've ever seen a slide deck from you that was more than 20 slides.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.530
Yeah. I have my keynotes are usually pretty big. In fact, I'm sure you have.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.530
You didn't realize they were that big because you just flipped by some because they were just some picture.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:10:01.420
Yeah. No, I'm thinking about the one where you had the the Avengers and the the janitors with the elephants.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.520
Maybe that was that that was probably at least 30. OK. Anyway, so that's coming up.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.520
That's the story there. I calmed them down. I said, look, interactive, blah, blah, blah.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.520
They said, OK. And they will be there in the audience watching me go.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.520
You make sure you fill this time. We will have a good time.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:26.810
I did a lot more work on the test for numbers, the automated test.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:34.810
And it is I think it's a good example of how to use automation or one way to use automation.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:45.000
There are 100 ways to use it. I am, as I've mentioned many times before, not a fan of UI automation and becoming less and less of a fan.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.220
As I feel like there's this this is balance. The world is falling deeper in love with UI automation.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:11:03.220
That statement is based entirely on tweets and blog posts and the massive number of UI test automation tools.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.220
I still I still see being created. So as the world falls more in love with it, I hate it even more.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:19.220
Why do you think that is? Because the test tools much better. No, the problems that we face back in the day.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.220
I think the problem is, is this we're going back to our transition into modern testing and agile testing.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:31.220
There's a world of crummy testers out there who think their way out is to.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.220
And this is the way they put it. I'm a manual tester and I want to get into automation.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:43.830
And they go, here's a tool for you. There are hundreds of thousands of those people who, as you know,

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.830
the industry will take a long time to get where we're going and to reflect the testing pyramid.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:54.830
And I read Mike Cohen's original paper from 10 years ago, eight years ago on the testing pyramid.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:00.630
And when he points to the top, he says you should write as few of these as possible.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:09.300
Yet people invest all their time. It drives me nuts. It I don't know why it is.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:16.720
But it appears that it's just what we're proposing is just blatantly counterintuitive.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:24.720
No, I think it is. But then I see people I respect agreeing. Maybe not wholeheartedly, but agreeing.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:36.170
When Richard Bradshaw, who gives workshops on test automation, I went on a tweet storm about this and he fully agrees.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.170
It's like, oh, but it turns out that it is that test automation term, which can often,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:47.170
which means to a lot of people writing code to automatically manipulate the UI of the application.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:54.390
And if you in his world, he calls it automation and test, I think, or we need a little better terms

00:12:54.390 --> 00:13:00.620
because I think there is a lot of code we can write to make our testing easier.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.620
And if you call that automation, it often gets lumped in with that UI automation and gets lost.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.620
I almost think we need a new term for that. Canar calls it tool assisted testing.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:18.190
I just call it testing. It's a slippery road. Anyway, he agrees.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:26.190
There are a lot of people who I think the people I see who are experienced in testing, they get it.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:32.190
It's the up and comers. And this is a gross generalization, but the up and comers who are,

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:39.190
quote, getting into automation are the ones who want to dive into manipulating the UI

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:45.190
and living with the pain themselves and driving their teams to live in that pain.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:51.190
I just, I just, there's so much better use of your time as a tester.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:56.190
I could see some influencing or influencers on this topic, right?

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:03.540
The we've talked about this before. There's reason to believe that the rest of the world,

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.540
at least in my view, there's reason to believe that the rest of the world is

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:19.860
following down the path of a unified engineering model or the reduction of a separate test team.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:30.860
We still see a lot of folks on in the Twitterverse talking about manual testing still being a dominant thing.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:38.860
One hypothesis is that these guys are, they're constantly under threat by, by, by the

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:46.860
phrasing of not technical enough. And so in a world where you're accused of not being technical enough

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.860
and you're moving towards a unified engineering model, then you,

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:57.060
I think you start looking around trying to find how do I make myself valuable?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.440
And you go, oh, automation. And I've been doing UI testing.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:11.700
So the next obvious step for me is to automate my job, which I mean, you and I have talked about this.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.700
We agree with that approach.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.700
And it is in fact, this path you're going down is in fact, what my keynote is about at,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:29.820
Oh, is it? Heisenberg. Gotcha. Yeah. And so I actually, and it's because,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.820
and that's probably it is because there's a high demand for this space.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:41.820
People are willing to sell it, even though those of us who are, have experienced in this space,

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:48.820
which is probably not the universe of manual testers, don't realize that these problems are

00:15:48.820 --> 00:16:00.330
significantly harder than the majority of our, of our testing problems, or at least automation ones.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:07.840
I'm being distracted by Alan monkeying with. So I had to pause because windows made by,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.840
I got paid by me. Screw you. And I'm going to keep this in the podcast.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:21.190
But of all the teams I worked in at Microsoft over 22 years, by far the most dysfunctional and Steve Rosen exception.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:30.860
He knows what he's doing. But what a piece of junk. I'm just so frustrated. Anyway, God, it just pop up.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:36.860
It's galore. I'm trying to record a podcast. That's awesome. Really happy with that. Really, really happy.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:45.860
So where were we? I just saw an article written this week talking about testers staying irrelevant in the new world.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.860
But over, you know, I was generalizing earlier, but over gross generalizations things,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:59.340
the article saying things like some teams think they can improve testing by firing all the testers and hiring just developers.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.340
I guess if you squint and back way up, you can look at it that way.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:09.340
But and I'm sure some pointy haired boss somewhere will say, oh, that makes sense to me. That's what I'm doing.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:18.340
But that's just kind of a stupid way to look at it. I know I could. And I'm not I'm not getting.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:25.600
But it is not. I mean, it's just you have to have the talent to be able to do that. Sure.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.600
And I'm in and I have seen that same approach implemented by idiots.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:42.050
And I have said this before and I'm and I'm sure I'll say it again, but I have told my boss and his boss that if I do my job right, I work myself out of a job.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:53.050
And I'm working. I am slowly embedding my team in development teams, not just as a member of my team, working for them as a member of their team working for them.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:18:01.140
So I am shrinking the size of my org slowly but surely while growing the size of my community.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:10.810
And that's and eventually I will just run a community. And then eventually that community will become self-sustaining.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:17.810
It will. That that's my goal. That's how I want to run. That's how I want my modern testing org to work.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:31.810
So eventually, eventually, I would expect all of my team to work for and be partnered with the feature teams they work with while I still run that community, help them discover ways to learn new things,

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:43.810
facilitate learning across that community. But as they get better at that, as I get better at working with not only them, but with the developers and product managers they work with, that community becomes self-sustaining.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.060
And at that point, someone has to give me a new job.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:57.640
What I see you doing is you're slowly but surely within your org. This is my view.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:05.640
Slowly but surely killing the concept of modern tester because what I see you doing is boiling the frog towards an actual unified engineering organization.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.640
Yeah, but a good one. Yes. A very good one.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:22.640
So you're maintaining, unlike what I've seen several dysfunctional teams in Microsoft, you're maintaining control of the test org while you push towards this unified engineering model.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:31.640
And a big difference to what I see among a lot of people in the web verse, I'll even go beyond Twitter, is that I'm not afraid of my job going away.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.150
No.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.150
In fact, I embrace it and it's a goal.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:51.730
One of the things that I have learned, like this has been my secret sauce in my entire career, is the more I automate my job away, the more valuable I become to the business.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:56.730
And the point is, one way to look at this is I'm growing and learning too.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:05.730
So at the time that my job becomes irrelevant and I'm no longer needed, I want it to go away because I know there'll be something different or better.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:11.730
You'll be grateful because you're like, crap, all that old world crap is slowing me down. Now I can go all in on this new thing.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.730
Yeah, and it's not even just a shift like that's done. Here's a new thing.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:23.730
As the community becomes self-sustaining, I likely already have my eyes on the new thing I want to do.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:29.730
And so that's what having that sort of transition excites me.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:35.050
So I just don't understand and it freaks me out and it doesn't freak me out.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:43.050
I'm annoyed a little how much people dig in their heels and say, no, I'm not going to change.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.050
I could just do what I've been doing forever and it'll be fine.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.880
Sure.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.880
I guess it's not the life for me.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.880
And then one other thing before we actually begin the show is ...

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.880
There is a saying, right? Knowledge is power, but ignorance is bliss. So pick which one you want.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:11.520
Absolutely. Absolutely. 40 years ago-ish, I used to go down to Tower Records.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520
I remember Tower.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.520
Tower Records. There was one in Limwood. I sometimes go to the one in the U-District.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.520
Silver Platters still exists.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:27.520
It does. But Tower was awesome because thumbing through albums with album art and the days before the internet when you couldn't look up and see when a band had a new album out,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:33.520
I would go for the bands I liked. Every week I'd go and I'd check out and see if they had a new album coming out.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.520
They had a magazine there. Maybe it's called Tower Records. Probably had a name. I forget what it was called.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.520
But in the back they had Desert Island Discs.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.520
As far as I know, this is the first publication to talk about Desert Island Discs.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.520
You could only take 10 records. I think it was 10 for them.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.520
To a Desert Island, what would they be? And they were always albums.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.520
Almost every single one had Dark Side of the Moon on it.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:09.060
So the episode of Tester's Island Discs, the 2017 and going on version, Episode 5 came out last night.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.060
Did it?

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:18.290
Which includes me and my eclectic but interesting selection of music and some stories.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:24.290
And I had a great time. I'm grateful for Neil having me on the show. But you can check that out too.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:30.290
I'm excited to have that out just in time for the end of the year flurry of podcasts and conference speaking.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.480
So there's a plug there.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.480
Plug away.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.180
Okay. Are we done with the intro?

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.180
Yes.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:46.180
Okay. We're going to kick it right off with Marcus had a question for the...

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.520
Mailbag!

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.520
Yes, Marcus.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.520
We might have to get a new mailbag sound in 2018. That one was funny a long time ago, but I don't know.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.520
Listeners, tell us what you think.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.520
So I'll read one from Marcus.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520
Okay.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:08.520
He had read an article from Bob Martin, Robert Martin, on cleancoder.com on code is not the answer.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:18.650
And he asks, any chance we can have your opinions again crafting great about crafting great code on a future podcast?

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:29.700
What can the modern tester do to help if at all, and how does this tie into how much separate teams of testers test the product?

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.700
I don't know, Brent. Do you and I have opinions?

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.700
We do.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.990
I do. Do you want to start? I mean, start.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.990
I can start.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:42.990
Okay. And if I remember, I'll put the link in the notes to the article.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.990
To the article that inspired it.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:50.280
So just looking at the...

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:57.920
I read the article. I'm trying to recall the salient points.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.050
If I had prepped it, I'd have written it down.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.050
We don't prep here on A-B testing?

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.050
No.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:10.080
But what I recall, the general theme, the name of the blog is tools are not the answer.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.080
Although the link to it is code is not the answer, which is interesting.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.080
It seems like he renamed it afterwards.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.080
Correct. He did.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.080
Right.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:35.160
And he said, hey, people doing all of this stuff, and it's resulting in the square root of nothing improvement.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.160
But it's people claiming it.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.290
And I will first say, yeah, that's true. Tools are not solely the answer.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:47.450
There is always, I'll call it the process trinity.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:57.410
If you, every time you want to influence a change, you need to simultaneously attack three things.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.410
The people, the process, and the technology.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:06.410
If you just create a new tool, and the people don't use it,

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:14.860
because you haven't changed the process to incentivize this, you're going to get nothing.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:22.270
So you can't focus on one of the pivots of that trinity.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:29.660
What Marcus asks is around, okay, recrafting great code.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.660
And then on separate teams of testers and the modern testers.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:43.880
So the first thing I'll say, in my humble opinion, modern tester does not focus on code correctness.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:50.360
I think the modern tester actually plays a very large role in crafting great code.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:58.780
And one in addressing that trinity, and two in identifying other ways in which the code may improve.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.780
And let me give you a crap ton of examples.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.780
Okay.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.780
One, I'm going to refer to your trinity, which is absolutely true.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:14.670
One of the things I've challenged every person on my team to do, if you're listening and haven't done it yet, it will come.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:22.280
One of the things, I don't like individual metrics, but I realized I don't like individual metrics that are shared.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.280
So in other words, I want to give, I ask you to measure something, but don't tell me how you measure.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.280
Don't tell anybody else.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.280
Just so you can measure your own progress.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.280
If you game that, then whatever.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.280
And the example I use for that is Brett makes faces here.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.280
Oh, I need the eye roll sound effect.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.280
Where's the eye roll sound effect?

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.280
That wasn't an eye roll.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280
That was a...

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280
What the hell?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280
And I will explain this better.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.280
So I'll pop out of the tangent.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.280
That's a brief, this is going to be a circular tangent.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.280
This is going to be hard to get out of.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.280
I will challenge you.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.280
I'll just talk to you, Brent, as if you're on my team.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280
Okay.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.440
I expect you to make the developers on your team better testers.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440
Okay.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.440
And I'm going to leave it up to you to how to measure that.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.760
And some examples may be code coverage, number of tests to say right.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.760
It can be a bunch of stupid things like that, some combination.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.760
You figure it out.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760
Don't share it with them.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.760
Don't share it with me unless you think it's really interesting.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.760
But have some measurement.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.760
If your goal is to, you have a goal to make the developers better testers,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.760
you should have an idea of what makes sense for you in your context in your team.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.760
And I don't care about the measurement.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.760
That's what I mean about that individual measurement.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.760
I don't care what the number is.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.760
I care about the output at the end.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760
So I want you to measure it so you can measure your own progress

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.760
and that's something to drive towards.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.790
But I don't care about the number going on with that.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.790
That's what I mean by the individual metric that I don't want to know.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:56.240
I want you to make the developers on your team better testers.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.240
Okay.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.240
Don't just write, going back to the Trinity,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.240
I almost got the stack popped here.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.300
Don't just write a testing tool.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.820
What I've found is, or an automation framework,

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.820
if it's not brain dead easy to use and part of the system

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:18.450
and or part of the system, people probably won't use it.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.450
For example, if I, as Brent Stairs said, it's fun.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.450
The funny face was for his phone, not for me.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:30.450
So if I write a framework and I tell you it's great

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.450
but it's hard to use and I can't figure it out

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.450
and as false positives, you're not going to use it.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.450
It doesn't matter.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.450
If I make it so brain dead simple for you to use

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.450
that you can't use it, they can't not use it,

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.580
you're going to use it.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.580
So there's an example there.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.580
I have spent a big chunk of my career,

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.580
talking about code craftsmanship,

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.580
implementing static analysis tools in code.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.700
Way back before we even had some of the more fancy

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.700
static analysis tools at Microsoft,

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.700
I would find a bug like,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.700
here's a for loop with the semicolon that's going,

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.700
this is C code.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.700
Those of you that are not old like me, a loop.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.700
Java has semicolons.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.700
Basically someone created a loop where the actual,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.700
what they intended to be the inside of the loop

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.700
would never execute.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.410
So I just wrote some Perl regx stuff

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.410
to grip through a whole bunch of code

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.410
and see if that existed elsewhere.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.410
This was back in 1996.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.410
So you scanned for a while one loops?

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.410
No, actually excluded those.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.410
Oh, okay.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.410
Because those can be valid.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.700
I found.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.700
Anyway, baby static analysis.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.700
Found a bunch of bugs, file bugs, stuff got fixed.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.700
Then static analysis tools came to automate

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.700
sure those were implemented,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.700
not just as something that was run outside

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.700
of the like, oh, run this when you have a chance

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.700
and fix the errors.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.700
Run it as part of the build process,

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.700
part of the check in process to find things.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.700
I learned coding in a backward way.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.700
I, before I was really very good at coding,

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.700
I read books like writing solid code

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.700
and debugging the development process.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.700
So I, not being as good of a coder as my peers,

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.700
as far as knowing all the language idioms

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.700
and things like that, I proved my value

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.700
by knowing a lot about how to craft good code

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:27.620
and how, what well constructed code looked like.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.620
So I came at it from that angle

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.660
and then pushed and spread that through static analysis,

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.660
through code review, through making sure

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.660
people could write tests, making sure people

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.660
thought through the system of what they're trying

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.660
to implement based on that learning.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.660
And that helped the teams I work with craft better code.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.660
At the end of the article, he talks about,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.660
the paraphrase here, he's in a room of developers

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.660
and he asks them how many had written unit tests

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.750
and nobody puts their hand up.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.750
He said like two out of 20 or something.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.750
Okay, alright.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:01.750
Artistic license.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.750
Yep.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.750
Which is frightening to you and I,

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.750
but when you look at the industry overall,

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.750
it depends who he's talking to.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.750
It's not unexpected.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.750
Not unexpected.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.750
One of the things I think,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.750
if my role as a modern tester, maybe this is,

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.880
as Brent and I further define,

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.880
what are the principles and actions of the modern tester,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.980
to me, one of the things they do is they make

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.980
the people around them better testers.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.980
I'm not even going to say developers.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.980
They make the people around them better testers.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.980
And that includes from unit tests

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.980
all the way up to exploratory testing.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.040
So I think if I'm the modern tester on that team,

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.040
where nobody's writing unit tests,

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.040
some of the low hanging fruit I go after right away

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.040
is not just telling them to write unit tests

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.040
or setting a mandate that they must write unit tests,

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.040
but helping them discover why unit tests are important

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.040
so they want to write unit tests.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.040
So there's a lot of discussion in the test community

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.360
around testers being specialists.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.360
And what you just talked about reminded me

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.360
of one of the things that I do actually believe in.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.360
And I don't think I've talked about it before.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.870
And that is, if you do have a specialist on the team,

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:26.870
their role is to share the knowledge,

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.870
particularly if it's something that's general,

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.870
such as testing.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.130
The one of the things...

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.130
Can you be a specialist in a generality?

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.130
No.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.130
Okay, I'll hold on.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:42.130
Like, you're talking about, hey, make better testers.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.130
And I realize that I have executed similar themes,

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:48.770
but I do it a different way.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.770
I operate under the assumption that a tester,

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.770
let's say a test specialist in this team, okay?

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.900
First thing I will say,

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.900
the test specialists on this team

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.900
will not do your testing for you, okay?

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.900
I'm not going to spin up the dysfunction loop.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.900
True, right?

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.900
So that's one of the problems I have

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.900
with how Marcus has phrased his question,

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.900
is how do we do this modern testing with several teams?

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:24.900
And when I saw that unit testing statement at the very end,

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.900
I'm like, yeah, I'm willing to bet you anything

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.060
that those developers,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:38.560
that a strong or a large number of those developers

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.560
are trained that tests owns testing.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.560
Sure. There's that...

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.560
Yeah.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.560
And this is one thing we have talked about before.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.560
It's that codependent feedback loop of...

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.560
I imagine the tester going,

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560
oh, you haven't tested your code at all?

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.560
Oh, I'll go test it for you.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560
Yeah, thank you.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560
Here are some bugs.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560
Thank you. I feel validated.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.560
Like, it's like, no.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.560
You're definitely hit it on the...

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.560
You hit the button when you said that

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.560
the role there is to help them test,

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.560
not to do the testing for them.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560
Correct.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.560
And that is the...

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.560
Okay, good.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.560
So we're on the same page.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.560
Of course we are.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.560
So far.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.560
Important to bring that up.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.560
But wait, I got a couple more things I want to say there.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560
No problem.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.690
The next thing is...

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.140
You say I want to make it better...

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.140
I want you to make your devs better testers, right?

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:34.420
I would actually...

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.840
If I did report to you, then I would say, okay, great.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.100
This is how I'm going to roll it out in my team.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.770
And what...

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.770
The way I would approach it is I would look at

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:54.770
what are the goals for test.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:59.960
And then I'm going to go and analyze how dev does their job.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.540
And either by changing the technology, people, or the process,

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.540
make it hard...

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:12.860
I'm going to add friction to the easy paths

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.860
and I'm going to make it hard for dev to fail.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.020
That's where I'm going to start with first.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.020
So what you were talking about.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.020
The...

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.020
All right, static analysis is super valuable.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.020
No developer is going to...

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.020
Devs are going to focus on building their own features.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.020
Let's get a static analysis tool

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:36.020
so that when they do a check-in or when they do a private build,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.020
they get a bunch of free feedback instantly.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.020
Right?

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.020
So those type of assets.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.020
The other thing I'm going to put into play

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.370
is I'm going to remove every stabilization period

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.370
and every friction point I can from check-in to prod.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:36:01.200
Because the biggest part of the problem here is the people side.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:09.680
Devs have been used to not being accountable for bugs in their own code

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.680
and it's time to get rid of that.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.940
So look, dev, when you think it's ready, check in.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.940
Knock yourself out.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:23.420
I'm going to add no prevention model

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.420
between their check-in to going to prod.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.450
But, and if you're afraid of the risk there, cool.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.450
Let's talk and figure out what you can do to solidify that.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:40.060
One, our devs, to varying degrees, are actually pretty good at...

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.060
They're moderately good at testing also.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.060
They don't have...

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.060
They all write unit tests.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.060
So we're pretty far down that road.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.060
But one thing you...

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.090
You started with an assumption that

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:58.410
for maybe a more junior modern tester is worth pointing out

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:02.500
is before you use...

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:08.500
One prerequisite to going down this path is, what's your life like?

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.500
And again, nobody's afraid of like,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.500
well, if they're doing all the testing, what am I going to do?

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.500
But I imagine...

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.500
So what happens?

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.500
Imagine your developers are really good testers.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.500
Then what's your role like?

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.500
So far, nobody is freaked out and thought,

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.500
well, I don't have anything to do.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.500
Because there's all kinds of stuff to do.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.300
Friends making a funny face.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.300
I don't understand the connection between what I just said

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.300
and what you're doing.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.300
It is, but I'm starting with why.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.300
Okay.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.300
To quote Simon Sinek, I think this works really well here.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.300
Why?

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:46.300
Is talk about why you want the developers to be better testers

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.300
or reflect on that.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.300
So if the developers are all much better testers,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.300
what does my world look like?

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.300
Think about that first and then figure out what you want to do.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.300
You kind of, inherently because you know that,

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.300
you skipped bringing that up.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.300
So I wanted to bring it up, even though I did poorly at the beginning.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.300
Thank you.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.620
I think the things I would focus on, just to sum up from my point of view,

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:13.520
is number one, I would...

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.740
In order to make that team better, the dev team better testers,

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:24.060
I would remove my testers from Critical Path.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.610
Right?

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:33.610
To do so otherwise is just inviting the dysfunction loop to just persist.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.610
And that is the number one thing, in my humble opinion,

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.610
that is the number one thing that prevents success here.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.610
It's that intra-team process.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.630
So I agree.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.630
I want to make sure you hit a little bit the second half of Marcus's question.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.630
Oh, sure.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:58.630
Which is, how does this tie into how much separate teams of testers test a product?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.630
And as you know, we're not fans of separate teams of testers.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:07.630
But say you have, for example, a large desktop product that ships quarterly,

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.860
and you need, and for better or for worse,

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.860
you need that stabilization integration period at the end of the product cycle.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.980
So I'm testing at the end before it goes out.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.980
I still wouldn't do that. Do I have to have that requirement?

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.980
You don't have to.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.980
Okay, thank you.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:29.980
So, but your statement leads to my better answer for that,

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.340
which is, over time, if the developers are better testers,

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.340
the need for that decreases.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:45.230
So the goal then is to reduce that time into zero or as close to zero as possible.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:53.230
Yeah, there is a variant of Kanban that integrates multiple different teams,

00:39:53.230 --> 00:40:00.230
where you have dev finishes coding in a small story,

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:07.230
that goes into a queue, and then test draws from a queue and validates.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:14.230
And in that model, tests often ends up being sort of acceptance testing.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:21.230
And it's still one small chunk that gets checked into main at a time.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.230
I would get rid of the stabilization period.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.230
I would keep the zero bug goal.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:32.230
I would add a new thing, a new process that says,

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:35.230
hey, we're going to integrate into main one thing at a time,

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.230
and main is always RTM-able.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:42.230
In addition to that, one of my favorite tricks on this is you,

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.230
is you tell the business team, by the way,

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:51.230
we're going to proactively communicate what features are in main

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.230
every time we add a new one.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:41:00.230
And the dev, the engineering team, will no longer have any say on ship date.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:04.320
So the business team could ship in a quarter,

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.320
they could ship in four months, they could ship every day.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:12.320
And what happens is then there's motivation on the engineering team

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.320
to literally keep main RTM-able all of the time.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320
Absolutely.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.320
And of course, living in the services world, that's always the case.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.320
But I think a lot of teams who have traditionally done shrink-wrapped

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.320
slash desktop products forget that,

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.320
or they think it's okay to ease away from that.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320
But I fully agree.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.320
Keep main, keep trunk, always shipable,

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.320
and a lot of those end-of-cycle problems go away.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.320
And just because I don't think we've talked about

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.320
the separate teams on a Kanban before,

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.510
the one thing that's really brilliant about this is,

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:54.510
so imagine you have a dev work column

00:41:54.510 --> 00:42:00.510
that goes into a test queue column followed by a test work column.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.240
If then it becomes super visible,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.850
if that test queue column is growing,

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:15.850
so dev is contributing to it faster than test can pull from it.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:19.850
Unlike, so a lot of the problems we've had in the past is,

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.850
oh, well, I'm getting compressed,

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.850
and or the ratio discussions, how many tests per dev, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.850
What this does is it creates a visibility tool

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.850
where leadership can look at it and say,

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:39.010
right, dev, you need to start helping test push these things through.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:42.170
But it's important that leadership recognizes that, oh.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.170
Well, transparency does that.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.810
No, we need more testers,

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.810
which is a conclusion you may make from that.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.810
When you and I look at that, well, you wouldn't,

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:53.810
but someone may make from that.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.810
You and I look at that and go,

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.810
oh, we need developers to have done more testing

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:02.840
so that the time it takes in the queue is shorter for these items.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.840
Or even if they've done a great job

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.840
and they just are accelerating a bunch of features.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:19.160
We need to make it a clear statement that test and dev are specializing generalists.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:27.260
And so at times, because our job is to finish work, not start work,

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.290
if there's a blockage in the queue,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:33.290
we're going to ask the dev team to switch sides

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.290
and, yeah, they're going to go slower.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:38.420
But it's still going to help the work move forward.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.420
Similarly, like it, and I don't like scrum, as you know,

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:47.420
but if you have a sprint model where you start and stop work all the time

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.420
and you have a sprint model with separate teams,

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.420
well, a lot of times if you have a one-to-one test to dev ratio,

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.420
you have a lot of idle testers.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.420
Well, that's a perfect time where they should be switching sides

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.420
and helping to write some of the code to get the flow going.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.540
Sure.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:05.540
Yep.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.540
So if we could shove in one more quick tangent mailbag, I think we can.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.540
Yeah.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.540
All right.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.540
So I was listening to the online test conference off and on.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.540
Danny Fott, one of the three, shout out to Danny,

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.540
gave a talk on modern testing.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540
It's pretty awesome.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.540
It was.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:25.670
And then I also heard a talk from Jesper Tutsen.

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:29.670
Jesper on shift left, which is a term I'm not.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.670
I get what he means.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.670
I'm a fan of Jesper and what he said.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.670
This whole shift left concept is, or it's not the concept.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:41.670
It's the, I don't like the word, but I did realize,

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.670
I tweeted this last night, is that when I type,

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.670
I use the left shift key almost exclusively.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.670
I hardly ever use the right shift key.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.670
So that's my new interpretation and final interpretation

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.670
of what shift left means.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.670
But anyway, he was asked whether testers who,

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.670
air quote, shift left, get pushed back from other areas

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:01.670
as they generalize.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.670
For example, do ops folks say, hey, this is my area.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.120
Go back to testing.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120
You know my answer.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.120
I'll let you answer first.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.210
Probably.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:17.240
So the next question is, and should you care?

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.240
Well, but one thing that's true in the,

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.240
what I think is true with modern testers is,

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.240
especially compared to the traditional tester,

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.240
is that conflict between disciplines just does not exist.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.240
It isn't a dev versus test thing.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.240
It isn't a test versus dev ops thing.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.240
It is a collaboration.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.240
And for anyone that doesn't get it,

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.240
you can have a conversation with them.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.240
You can collaborate with them and they will get it.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.240
I think modern testers don't seek out conflict.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.240
Modern testers resolve conflict.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.500
That's my thought.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.500
And I think part of being, this rule is,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.500
and not that shift left equates to modern tester,

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.500
but from our viewpoint, I think that it makes sense to...

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.500
Did you see all of his talk?

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.500
Yes, first?

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.500
No, just the last half.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500
Okay.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.070
Because he tweeted out a shout out to the podcast

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.070
and I don't know.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:18.070
I don't.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.070
I wasn't able to see the deck.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:20.070
Oh, I did see that part, yeah.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.070
Yeah, what was the context there?

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.620
Are we left shifters?

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.620
Apparently.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.620
Okay.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:31.620
So on the dev ops, are people in dev ops going to...

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.620
Yeah, I mean, yes, they are.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.620
Of course they are.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.620
Anybody who is solidified in the job

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.620
and sees it, a whole bunch of untrained people

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.620
going into that role,

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.620
yeah, they're going to get a little bit defensive.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.620
The thing is...

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.620
I don't think they necessarily will.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.620
You can say they can get a little defensive.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.940
It's the job...

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.940
In my experience, they may or may not.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.940
You just have to distinguish between the job

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.940
and the activity.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.940
Right?

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:11.940
I have not encountered a dev ops problem space

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.060
where they were sufficiently funded,

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:21.500
where they had all of the staffing to handle the problem

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.500
that they need to.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.500
One of the biggest problems in a dev ops space

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.500
that I've observed, it's actually very similar,

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.500
in my mind, to the automation space back in the day,

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.500
where if you get into this infinite loop

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.500
where you have leadership who thinks that we need to automate everything,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.600
what ends up happening if you're not paying attention

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.600
is that slowly but surely

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:53.600
all of your particular resources are being sucked into maintaining

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.600
the technical assets that you have built.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.600
Similarly with dev ops,

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.600
brute force, this idea of STEs moving to dev ops,

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.600
yeah, that's important right now

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:12.600
because services, a lot of the tooling isn't universalized,

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:18.600
the universe isn't generalized across all of these contexts.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.600
There's a lot of great tools, a lot of monitoring systems,

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.600
but who's looking at it, who's taking action?

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.600
That tooling hasn't hooked up.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.600
It's all context sensitive based off of the service that you're building.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:36.560
So you hire these dev ops people to mitigate via brute force.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:42.560
As you do that, you find that people start then optimizing for,

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.560
how do we corral these army of manual dev ops folks?

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.560
Because we need to make that more efficient and that more efficient.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.560
And that's where I start actually,

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.560
I'm starting to see a little bit of the same sort of test as function

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.560
that we used to have.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.560
So I haven't seen that.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.560
And I use dev ops as an example,

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.560
or ops, I can't remember if that was Jesper's example or not,

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.560
but it's an area where I chose it for my example

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.560
because I think there's a lot of overlap

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.560
between a specialized generalist tester role

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.560
and a specializing tester, specializing generalist ops role.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:22.910
They both probably use and know how to use Docker, for example.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.910
I think it's important they do.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.910
I think there's a lot of overlap.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.910
I am working on partnering my team a lot with our ops team

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.910
on creating monitoring for quality metrics.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.910
And it's a partnership.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:35.910
It's not like, oh, that's my job.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.910
It's like, let's work on this together.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.910
I think that's what I'm going to do, and you help me.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:45.910
While I have seen ops as sort of the dumping ground that test used to be,

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:50.460
I don't think it's necessarily the norm.

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:54.460
Anyway, to rewind the stack and go back to the point,

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.460
sure, there can be some conflict.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.460
I don't think it's necessary.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.460
I don't think it's rampant.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:06.460
I think that in a team where the specializing generalist quality role

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.460
could accelerate the achievement of shipable quality,

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.680
that personal conflict is a bottleneck that we can help resolve.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:24.160
I personally have a lot of interaction with our DevOps here in Azure.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:34.150
And I'm doing a lot of things that one could argue belong in their domain and control.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:38.250
When they discover it, I'm like, hey, you know what?

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.250
You're right.

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:41.250
There's one bit that doesn't belong to you.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:43.250
It belongs to me.

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:49.110
But everything else, I'll hand off to you immediately.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:53.240
It's about who can get things done.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.240
And the thing that I often fall back on is like, look,

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:02.240
I'm in Azure Compute, and my business is asking for these results.

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.240
So if you're going to build it, great.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.240
This is the time we need it.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.240
If you can't deliver that to the timeline, I need to build it.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.240
This is what's being asked for.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.240
I'm happy to work with you as I build it,

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.240
and then we can construct a mechanism that I build it in a way

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.240
that then eventually hands off to you.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.270
That's fine.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.270
Yeah, exactly.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:28.270
My goal is to solve a business problem in the time in which the business needs it solved.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:32.270
Yeah, and I think it should be at a larger scale,

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.270
is that we need to cut our throats, apparently, is telling me.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.270
I guess we're out of time.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.270
There's people getting it.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:39.270
All right.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.270
OK.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:42.270
We got to go because Brent talked too long.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:43.270
I'm Alan.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:44.270
I'm Brent.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.270
And we'll see you next time.
