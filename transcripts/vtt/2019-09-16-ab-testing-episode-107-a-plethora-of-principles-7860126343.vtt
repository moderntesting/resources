00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:23.540
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey Brent! Howdy Alan! We're back it's been a while. It has.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:31.340
I traveled and then I was so tired from traveling I forgot to show up for a podcast.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:40.820
And I traveled first somewhere in there right? We're back and we're glad to be back for episode 7.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.820
Yes 7.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.500
Episode 1900. You know there's a thing in podcast now sort of inspired by all the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:01:01.390
NBR podcasts podcast in seasons. Season 4 of the HSC podcast which is way too hard for me because I don't know if we were like really had our act together had a theme

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.670
on season 7 of AV testing we'll be talking about UI automation.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:19.870
It just doesn't work out that way. We are pretty certain season 7 we will be talking about UI automation. We fail to have that level of organization.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.150
So we're like a hundred and you know.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.310
A hundred and seven. Yes.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.310
It's on the board. The board is behind me because Brent is in charge of the show.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.630
Oh wow. OK.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:43.780
I went to London. I caught not even a cold. I started coughing and now I've been coughing this like this cough since forever.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.640
How long ago were you. You've been out of London two weeks. Yeah.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:03.400
Yeah it's been. I'm going to San Francisco next week for work back for a month going to Montreal Montreal for a couple of days in October November.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.560
It's all leading somewhere. I'm doing my one and only conference speaking parents of 2019.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.260
If you want to come here we talk about something related to modern testing. I haven't done my slides yet and I don't quite remember my abstract.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.250
I'll be in Malmo Sweden for or dev in November.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.570
What is or dev.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.560
It's a conference software conference.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.320
Is that a DevOps type of conference.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.120
It's more of a dev. There's a testing track. They're going to regret putting me on.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.060
Yeah well we'll just say you wanted to get into the dev conferences. So I think that's the right way to sort of maybe.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.740
And I said why in one of the first conferences that said no to last year.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.540
What am I hated. So I promise I might come back to following here. So I'm doing it.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.340
I'm sure they will.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.350
Do you have if you stock it with.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.820
M.O.T. folks and.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.750
There's a large number of people in Europe that are fans.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.510
Yep. We got some M.O.T. years in Europe Ministry of Test fans.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.270
Oh speaking of which and then I'll shut up. You can get on the show or whatever you want to talk about.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.070
I am putting the finishing touches that all the main recordings in the first round of edits for minutes.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.750
Modern testing course on that will be available only to club members in their club.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.790
They yell at me all the time about confusing ministry testing the dojo and the club.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.670
And I'm sorry because I'm never going to get them right.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.950
But I managed to edit in the proper names for the. Yeah.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:14.980
OK. A couple of days ago you and I received a tweet.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:26.680
So there's two gentlemen Aaron Hodder and Luke Liu who sat down and.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.230
You sure they were sitting. I am not sure that that that may in fact be.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.670
particular for details correct.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.550
That in fact may be an exaggeration but in my imagining they were sitting but they were together.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:52.690
That is a true fact and they sat and stared at three sets of principles and came up with their own.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:03.400
And on Twitter they asked a whole bunch of people if we could provide some feedback.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.600
They generated. So the title of the blog is software testing principles.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.800
It's on Alan or Aaron. Sorry. Hodder's blog.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:22.210
But in the section down below they referred to it as Aaron and Luke's software beliefs.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.930
And what they did is they took the I.S.T. Q.B.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.730
principles the CDT principles and the M.T.P.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.500
I think Aaron titled it software testing principles because he collected three sets of software testing

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.890
principles and then they in their own words since they're synthesized them add it and added their own

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.570
beliefs and experiences and came up with a set of beliefs.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:58.250
Where they're referencing where possible they're referencing principles from the other three sets.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.540
They asked for our feedback.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.460
One set of principles to rule them off.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.780
I don't think it's a set of principles.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.900
It's our set of beliefs.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.800
They asked for our feedback and what a better form feedback than a podcast that goes to three people.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:24.560
Absolutely. And not only that because we care deeply about the quality culture of our team and we coach lead and nurture

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.320
the team towards a more mature quality culture.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.680
That sounds like principle number four of the modern.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.440
It's almost exactly verbatim.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.980
I thought you know what let's do that and let's knock off an episode as well.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.950
How about that two for one.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.950
So what do you want.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.070
You want to look at their go through their principles.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.390
I'll go through their principles.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.710
They have one by one.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.910
Let's do one by if we can.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.430
We'll probably have to go quick.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.510
They have 12 beliefs and they're not they're not principles.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.310
They're beliefs.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.590
OK. And I guess number one.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.040
All right. Number one is testing is information gathering and reporting.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.010
Thoughts. Have you read these yet.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.970
Yes I read them.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.930
I read them a couple times.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.290
OK.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.260
I don't I know this comes from I think the context driven testing.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.820
They do not reference any principle.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.660
I thought I read one which they referenced.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.300
So yeah I have to think about the reporting.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.700
Of course testing is your gathering information.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.220
Your order to mitigate risk.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.580
Understand more about the product.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.400
But I haven't I haven't thought about not totally against it but I haven't

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:54.210
thought about how or why reporting is nothing could be part.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.810
I think they're part of the six out there.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.890
But other than that I don't have really a problem with it.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.250
So I do.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.260
Information gathering and reporting.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.230
They're important for a large number of things.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.830
I was going to say that's a very general thing.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.470
Reading a book is information gathering report.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:23.900
Right. I just did a quick search on Google and I think this is closer.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.300
Right. There's a couple of definitions here of testing.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.500
First off I think the thing I think that they're calling out is testing is an

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:40.840
activity and certainly information gathering and reporting is a key output.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.880
But like here's an example definition testing is the process of evaluating a

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.920
system or its components with the intent to find whether it satisfies the

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.160
specified requirements or not.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.560
I think we've all heard that one.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:53.960
We can.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.040
Let's do that one a little bit.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.920
Or testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps errors or

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.040
missing requirements.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:10.460
So I don't it tells me where they're coming from which I think is a fine set of

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.180
beliefs.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.660
But from a modern testing I actually think that set of beliefs is what if we

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.260
rephrased it instead of testing is information gathering and reporting.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.740
What if we said we perform the testing activity in order to gather information

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.060
and report on it.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.420
That's better.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.300
I think it turns more into a principle.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.340
It I think that's better.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.750
Testing.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.580
Yeah anyway I think that's enough on.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.180
OK.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.260
One.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:42.780
OK.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.620
Not triggered.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.740
Kind of like I get where they're coming from.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.300
I get where they're coming from.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.140
The only issue again from from a belief system.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:10:00.590
The only issue I have is is I do think people who view information

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.430
gathering and reporting as the actual goal of testing.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.900
That's kind of one of the reasons why we built empty in my humble.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.380
Yeah.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.260
Yeah it's kind of.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.780
Yeah I agree because I think that point of view is actually going to harm.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:22.860
And even my statement that says we do testing in order to do X and Y X and Y are two of the

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.920
twenty six other things you do as part of that you can do as part of testing.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:36.630
Our principle number one is business value is critical and that's actually why you do testing.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.390
Yeah.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:47.110
And the thing I like about of course I'm I hurt my arm patting myself on the back about the modern testing principles is I joke about they're not being about testing and not being all that modern.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:55.070
But the you do you perform the testing activity in many cases to help promote those principles.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.430
Anyway.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.430
All right.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.790
Next one.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.310
Yes please.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:04.900
Test coverage is always relative to some model and then they refer to I.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.900
ST QB principle number two.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.540
I have to which is exhaustive testing is not possible.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.380
The nice thing about the I.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:21.940
ST QB principle is not a single like they're the longest one has looks like nine words.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:25.210
Sure.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:32.730
So their their belief is test coverage is always relative to some model.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.290
So that's a true statement.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.620
It's also not that profound or interesting to me.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.450
Now the interesting part of that statement would be model.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:58.140
So if it's relative to some some model how do you select that model that's going to be the thing you compare against.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:11:59.980
Right.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.820
You could abstract this to a larger form of testing and say testing.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.500
But it says test coverage is related to some model.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.940
Testing is related to some model.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:12.980
Sure.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.360
Sure.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:26.480
So but I know where I again I know where they're coming from because there is a lot of emphasis from the traditional world on coverage not just code coverage but feature coverage requirement coverage other kinds of coverage.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.120
It's important to a lot of pointy haired bean counters.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:38.280
So it isn't I see why they're calling that out because test coverage by itself is dumb.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:47.000
But but in the context of a model where you can communicate use it to communicate risk or or progress or something then it becomes more viable.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.400
And I think the point that they're trying to state is the relativity right.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:13:00.100
You you are there is always more testing that can be done no matter how far you've gotten.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.020
There's always more that can be done.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.300
Right.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.900
So you you can never claim completeness.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:16.700
May May I tangent as size briefly just on a conversation I had yesterday and I have to abstract this out because I pushed back on my boss and and he didn't get what I was saying.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.700
But I'm big on models.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:35.860
So there's we're having a not going to say heated a passionate discussion about some model one model we're building and someone brought up a model that I had suggested a while back which I just got from the Internet.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.040
And and they said what about a model like this.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:48.020
And my manager said I agree with what's in that model but we won't use that model.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.050
And then my again my semantic asshole ism.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:06.250
I said if we do what's in the model just because we refuse to acknowledge we're using that model doesn't mean we're not using the model.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.870
You follow me probably not.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.660
I do.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.380
The model is more than the drawing on paper or the diagram or the word.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:23.940
The model is the is the framework and even if you're not following the framework directly if you're doing the things in the framework you're sort of following the model anyway.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:33.420
It would like be saying no we don't do scrum scrum stupid but then everything that you actually do.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.100
Just because you don't call it scrum doesn't mean you're not following the scrum model.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:38.740
Right.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:50.260
And and by putting your foot in the stand saying no we're not doing that we're not following that model but doing it anyway is a little weird but anyway not not not a point to lose my job over anything but.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.340
But anyway now you have a little bit of insight in the way I work and I will never be employed again.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.700
And so going on how about the next one.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:58.620
Okay.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.940
Thank you for riding along on our tangent for down to two listeners.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.180
Yeah.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.220
Now I'm thinking about vanilla ice right.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.220
And don't think about ice.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.350
No he added another beat.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.290
It has nothing to do with the Bowie queen.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:26.660
Yeah anyway what we test and how much we test should be based on models of risk.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.770
Now this one's interesting because they refer to empty number seven.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.660
Huh.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:41.220
What we test how much we test should be based on models of risk.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:16:03.280
And just for listeners who may be joining soon that's Alan am I's principle and it is we expand the testing abilities and know how across the team understanding that this may reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.440
Now I can tie a connection there but I am fine.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.680
I failed to see the connection.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.360
I have to go through a very convoluted process to get there.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.800
So let's let's not worry about that.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.760
We can disagree that it that we don't we can agree we don't see the connection.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.440
Maybe the intended to refer to number five.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:38.440
So we don't talk about which which modern testing principle if any do you think talks about risk based testing or risk based approach software development.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.020
Quality culture.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.820
I would if it I would do number one and five for that.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.380
Oh actually yeah I would do one.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.260
The quality culture.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.300
No it's one.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.140
It's definitely one.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.100
It's improving the business.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.080
Well again one of five is where I'm going to go with on that one.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.680
So we agree.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.160
Yeah.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.640
But we test and how much we test should be based on models of risk.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.420
Yeah that I don't disagree with.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:22.750
Now here what I think the where they may go to number seven is number one what we test and how much we test.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:23.980
Right.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.870
Because a lot of people interpret number seven wrongly.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.790
Yes as the second sentence not the first.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.470
Yeah.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:40.710
And I I think and we'll wait and see when it comes out and what the what the observations are.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:54.430
I think I did a really I'm going to pat myself on the back again of all of the things that I walk through and I I hope people get through the whole modern testing course on history testing because I get better at explaining as I go along.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:07.730
I think I did a really nice job explaining how principal seven works and put some exercises in that got people thinking about what it would how how that looks in execution.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:13.290
So again get your club membership for that course because that's going to be hot hot hot.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.810
I'd like to see that before it releases.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.290
You're not changing anything.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.330
It's perfect.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.290
I'm sure it is but I'd like to see it before it releases.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.780
But have your people talk to my people.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:34.170
Every time we've re explained like the the blog post that I did on modern testing principles.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.730
Yeah that that I felt was the clearest I've ever explained it right.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.650
It is around me number seven and is around.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.130
I should read that.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.010
Do the right thing even though it's scary.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.140
Well yeah yeah.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.700
That's true as well going on.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.180
All right.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.180
Number four.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
So again for number three what we test and how much we test.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.620
I don't think there's a lot of disagreement there.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.660
None except for we don't get why it's empty seven.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.420
Correct.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:16.780
And that number four it is often better to perform a variety of tests than repeat tests.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.140
True often nearly always.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.660
And they're not to IST QB number five.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.900
Breath breath over depth in most cases.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.700
Beware the pesticide paradox.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.780
Oh Borthweiser.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:35.840
True.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.740
And the difference is now we talk about.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.420
No I think it's true.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:40.820
What I.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.460
Isn't that it.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.220
Is that an insider is that a tautology.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.300
That's what I'm trying to judge in my head.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:55.050
It's neither it's a principle about the testing activity.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.730
The reason it's sitting wrong with you is because our principles and our beliefs do

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.650
not focus on the testing activity they focus on delivering quality software.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.930
The testing activity falls out of that if you're doing it right.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.090
So I'm going to wholly agree with it because one of the things that drives me

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:18.370
nuts and this is not a modern testing principle but certainly influence a great

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.290
deal of my part is that I cannot stand the test zombies.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.360
My job is to run the same suite over and over and over and over and over and over

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.520
and over and over and over.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.840
And also let me.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.560
I'm going to chuck someone under the bus here but I'll do it vaguely.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.800
So you want to know who I'm talking about.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.300
I had a I'll just say I was talking to some.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:49.580
People recently and we were talking about.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:57.580
Doing a deeper breath or broader set of tests do broader types of testing

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.460
and they made a statement roughly equivalent to well we already do all the

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:02.980
testing.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.300
There's no more testing to do.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.020
I think another way I may phrase this principle from Aaron and who do you

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.420
run them with.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:11.860
I'm sorry.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:20.190
Luke for Aaron and Luke is always there's always there's always more testing

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.430
to do and it's not the same testing you did before.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.630
Meaning always strive for different ways to test things and get that broader

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.870
sense of that broader approach or scope to your testing.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.380
That's that's my takeaway from that.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.020
I think there's always there's always testing you haven't thought of yet.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.920
Well it says it's often better.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:49.060
And so when I think of better like to me when it comes to testing I always

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.860
judge better by the business value.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:53.680
Right.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:00.200
Hey I can I can spend a week doing an exhaustive performance test or we can

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.120
ship this thing and start making money on it tomorrow.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:03.150
Right.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:04.880
Right.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.320
Or if it's or we can ship this thing and make our customers super happy and

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.640
and love us tomorrow.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.080
Right.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:12.800
Exactly.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.200
Business value doesn't have to be about money.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.110
It doesn't.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.110
It doesn't.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:23.040
It is generally about money or growth though.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.530
The one thing people people will go it's not all about money man.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:33.530
And I'm like look a business's job is to serve its customers and a business

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.890
needs money to continue to do that.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.100
Yes.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:37.820
Okay.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:44.020
So while it could be in a lot of times people will do money is the

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.380
root of all evil blah blah blah.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.660
No money.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.470
It is how it is used that defines if it's evil or good.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.790
Sure.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.830
And I'd like to know how many of our listeners and maybe one of the three

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:03.090
does this but if you do your testing activities for free in the company

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.330
asked me I don't need to pay you but but I want to make the point is

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.090
when it isn't always a direct line between improving the business between

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.540
making money like the customer is giving me cash.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.860
It could be that customers love you.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.180
So because you're adapt to their needs so that investors love the

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.780
company and then put money into the company that way.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.500
Anyway.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.300
Again another tangent.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.380
Are we back on track.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.660
How many are to go.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.960
We're we're on number five now.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.560
OK cool.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.280
Out of twelve.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.030
We'll get there.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.750
Hold on time.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:36.590
We got plenty of time.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.710
We can't ever be certain that there are no problems.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.310
OK.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.110
Yep.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:47.210
True.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:48.410
Yeah.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.250
Amor's order of ignorance.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.100
Yeah.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:54.620
We don't know.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.060
We don't know.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.220
His name is his name is just armor.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.220
I like Amor.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.180
Philip armor.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:00.980
OK fine.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:08.910
If he's one of our three lists a product can meet all its stated requirements

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:14.110
and still be useless true product can fail to meet all of its stated

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.470
requirements and still be useful.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:17.700
True.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.180
True.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:24.420
And to me that is the difference between quality and testing.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.880
It's also principle number one if you focus just on making sure the

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.320
requirements are met but it doesn't improve the business value you have

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.040
failed right.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.480
You have not improved the business.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:45.690
No I mean if we go back to the definition I read earlier where testing is

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:51.450
essentially the the activity to validate the stated requirements as well

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.250
as look for gaps in the requirements.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.210
Right.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:01.650
Then the act of testing as as Whitaker said so long ago all that testing is

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.930
getting in the way of quality.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.050
Oh you know you piss more people off down to no listeners.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.090
We'll get them back.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.770
Seven.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.460
Oh and by the way the references for that was CDT 5 and MT 5 testing can

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:23.300
happen at any stage of any software development lifecycle and it is

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.380
usually better to begin testing early rather than later.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.180
I STQB number three.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.420
I I would even get rid of the word can testing must happen or testing

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.460
happens at all stages of software development.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.420
Yes completely agree with that.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.390
How do you feel about the second sentence.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:45.230
It is usually better to begin testing early rather than later.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.220
Usually sure.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.060
I'm okay with that.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.840
Yeah that to me is some words in here that makes the least I mean

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.480
difficult to disagree with.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:13.810
I am going to say I can add certain weaselly words but I'm not certain

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.450
I agree with that.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.240
Do you think is it because I think there's certain tests I think there's

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.640
a lot of tests that must be done in an early and preventative manner.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.200
I agree.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.000
I think a large number of tests can be done post ship.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.560
I agree there as well.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.720
And I think it's the word it's the word usually that I can't that makes it

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.400
inarguable.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:42.930
Yeah.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.390
See that's that's the one I want to argue with.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.820
Principle and I would have site I would cite principle number six.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.720
Yeah right.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.760
As as no.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.580
Well if we talk about testing right.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.460
MT is not about testing is about quality.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:04.900
All right.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.860
Next one shorter periods of testing that happen more often are better than

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.740
longer periods of testing that happen less often.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.780
No disagreement there.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:20.780
They did not cite a principle but I would have cited modern testing

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:26.060
principle number two or number three.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.740
Are they sort of saying that it's sort of a roundabout way that testing

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.660
continuously is better than testing at the end.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.420
Yes.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:33.900
OK.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.150
I would have said it that way.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.830
Right.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.710
And so I think we have a modern testing principle that covers that or at least

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.390
two of them right.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:50.220
What did this is basically saying doing things continuously getting continuous

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.120
feedback is more valuable.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:00.420
Alan has just given me a thumbs up as he was gently chugging coffee.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.380
I was chugging coffee.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:09.700
There are no best practices only good practices in context.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:19.680
CDT number two as someone who just made some semantic arguments earlier in

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.360
the episode.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.720
Now I'm having a hard time semantically arguing this.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.240
This has been number one from the CDT world forever is that best practices

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.120
the horrible term because there is no very best.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.760
There's only there dependent on context.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.120
I totally agree with that.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:45.570
So I'm a little tainted because of the of the massive amount of emphasis on getting

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.290
rid of the phrase best practices.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.250
I am from it's a model.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.330
Anyway I get it.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:58.170
Yes true practices all practices are good in context calling something best is just

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.410
something someone invented a while back and stuck and now pisses people off.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.450
But I get both sides.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:11.220
My version my version of this statement and I do agree with it is that there is no

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.380
such thing as the best way to do anything.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.700
Once we have established the best way it's just a matter of time before a new best

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.900
way pops up.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.260
You're absolutely right.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:29.620
But there is such a thing as the best thing to do right now with the currently

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:36.100
known information which is another way of saying practice for context.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.540
Let me let me ask you a question.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:39.740
OK.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:45.770
Is trying to think of a good example here is you are using tools to compile your

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:51.170
code to best practice or should you compile it by hand with an assembler with

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:51.930
an assembler.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.530
Sure.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.680
So the best the best current best current practice that you use a a compiler to

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.520
compile your code.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.520
Who the hell would be compiling with an assembler.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.480
All right.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.920
Anyway that was a horrible example which may get edited out or I'll see how drunk I

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.760
am when I edit this.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.960
But let's try it.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.160
But you know so.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.080
So I have a con.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.060
I mean that without the assembler bit that's a problem I have in my team

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.860
right now.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:31.000
So we're we're producing a bunch of awesome models initially did not make

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.200
sense to build up a CDC pipeline to produce the models right.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.540
Turns out we did some search.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.740
It's not exhaustive.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:49.860
We don't see much around how to do pipelines for producing Python models.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:56.990
If anyone anyone's a listener and they know of one please tweet me that tool.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:57.630
Pie pipeline.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.100
I just made that up.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.060
Don't write it down.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:12.660
It if if it exists it might be called pie pipeline that the the Python community

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.420
likes putting PY in front of everything or just pipeline with Bell PY PE L.A.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.830
Any you know what if that one doesn't exist I will build that one.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:24.150
Here to help.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:29.350
There's three things difficult in computer software naming things and off

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.950
by one errors.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:36.620
But it's expensive to put together the pipeline.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:42.580
It only makes sense if we know that we have enough of a value proposition to

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:50.230
continue to do this and continue to provide updates to our models which we

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.670
have gotten past but initially there's no way.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.950
Yeah.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.910
Because if someone said the best practice you have to have a CICD pipeline

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.780
and you would but you don't have a system that needs that yet it'd be stupid to do

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.860
it and it is a best practice.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:11.370
It's an accelerate our favorite book on the podcast accelerate by Nicole

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:11.930
Forres-Gren.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.290
Just humbled you just called it a celebrate.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.090
It's all great.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.330
Which is what it is.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.210
Absolutely accelerate is accelerate.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.970
Okay.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.650
It's a hell of great.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.250
Come on man.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.690
You're stalling.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.090
Let's go on.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.010
Did I already do 10.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:29.090
No I don't think we.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.530
Wait wait wait.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.650
Yeah we just did nine.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.170
Do I thought we just did seven.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:33.730
Nine.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.090
There are no practices.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:36.730
OK.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:37.210
Did we skip it.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.690
Number 10.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:38.650
Eight.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.640
No we didn't skip eight.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.200
OK good.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:41.440
All right.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:41.680
Let's go.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.640
Ten change happens and that's a good thing.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.360
Therefore our practices should be as responsible as possible.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.760
Here they referred to empty number two.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.170
Could you read empty two for the for the readers.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.410
Yes listeners.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.290
Are those reading the transcript that doesn't exist.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:06.100
Empty two we accelerate the team and use models like theme thinking and theory of

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:11.020
constraints to identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.860
Which I guess yeah that does align.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.780
It's about being adaptive which we fully agree with.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.950
But not modernism.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.110
Crystal number two Aaron and Luke principal number 10.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.910
We should we should change as needed in order to support the business.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:29.960
Yeah.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.460
I guess the only feedback I would say is sort of I would I would tweak their

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.500
language like change happens and that's a good thing.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:45.580
Still has an element of being punitive.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.860
I think I think what they're getting at is the thing we've talked about.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.940
I care about it for sure on air or off or people are resistant to change.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.620
People are afraid of change that we talked about on there as well.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.500
Principle number seven.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.900
If change happens it's a good thing.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.180
Figure out why it's happening and how you write like oh wait you can be the

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.180
butterfly or you can be the wind.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:07.980
I like that one.

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:08.500
Yeah.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:14.300
I think of it as the discussions we've had around software development.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:19.160
Models prescriptive iterative or adaptive.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:27.890
I would say a little bit stronger insane adaptive development models are known

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:33.610
today to be not only more successful but significantly so quit fearing it.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.530
It it boosts everything good.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.010
All right.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.890
Anyway yep.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:49.060
Number 11 testing is a testing is a performance not a procedure and

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.220
certainly not an artifact.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.840
So I think it was Chris McMahon who was the first person I heard

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.320
called testing a performance.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.600
No he called and actually Chris is going to yell at me now because it was he said

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.200
this is interesting because he gave a talk on this that was really good.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:14.320
He said a agile team making software is a performance and Chris being a very good

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.560
musician made some really good parallels to a performance because you're adapting

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.360
on stage to each other and delivering software.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.960
But I haven't heard testing is a performance before by itself.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.440
So is that based on somebody's principle.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.000
Yeah.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.560
Where does that come from.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:42.130
Uh it's CDT six and seven and CDT six and seven.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.080
Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:47.600
True.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.200
True.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.720
So is good software development.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.960
Actually any knowledge work is a challenging intellectual process.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.280
It should be.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:55.840
Yep.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.600
If it isn't you're doing it wrong.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.680
Yes.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.830
Uh C prior comment around test zombies.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:08.910
Uh only in number seven is only through judgment of skill exercise cooperatively

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.750
throughout the entire project.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:14.190
Are we able to do the right things at the right time to effectively test our

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.390
products.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.950
So I would re I brief rates went a little bit in the Chris McMahon frame

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.630
and I would say delivering quality software as a performance and with the

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:28.990
parallel being it is a team and not an individual effort to do so.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.670
Yeah.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:34.910
So when it says testing is a performance I don't have the music theory

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.940
background that you do.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:43.500
So I was thinking of this as not the way you interpreted it.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.940
I was like, Oh, this is a grammatical error and they're talking about

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.620
performance testing, but still weird.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.380
Maybe I'm talking, no, I don't have a clue what the hell they're saying here.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.500
Um, that's almost literally how it happened.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.500
It is certainly not a procedure.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:04.980
It is certainly not an artifact, but you, they don't reference empty seven

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.570
here, right?

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:13.340
Cause the closest thing to sort of testing is a whole team problem in

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.940
empty is number seven.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:15.900
Right.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.900
And if, if that's how you interpret it, I agree.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.500
I don't understand what they're saying here.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:28.460
And then their last principle, I value healthy teams of people building useful

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.580
products for people consistent with my ethical beliefs in a way that

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.180
minimizes waste.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.740
My focus is on reporting threats to that value and the values of my stakeholders.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.520
And they refer to empty number one.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:56.560
And their last sentence, their last sentence.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:04.560
Their last sentence came across to me as the opposite or, or at least in

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.120
conflict with our first principle.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:18.640
Uh, the way when you and I were wordsmithing principle number one, I was

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:24.360
thinking around how do I get people to stop thinking of testing as reporting.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:25.800
Activity.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.520
Yes.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:36.640
And here is an example of someone who's actually using empty one to, to justify

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:36.840
it.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.220
Um, now, could you read that second sentence again?

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.300
My focus is triggered me a little bit.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.690
So my focus is on reporting threats to that value and the values of my

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:49.650
stakeholders.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:58.160
So reporting, but this is the first one where I see testing referred to as a

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:04.650
community of people, not a practice or an activity, right?

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:11.070
My focus, I, yeah, it, my focus is on reporting threats.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:13.300
Right.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.970
My focus and, and, and the reason it triggered me is the focus is

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.530
on improving the business.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:26.970
One thing you may do as part of improving the business is highlighting

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.560
threats for the team, highlighting routing, call it threats, highlighting

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:31.960
risk.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.320
Uh, we shine the spotlight as needed in order to improve the business.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:43.940
Uh, the focus here is I think opposite is too strong.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.900
To me, it conflicts.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:51.260
Uh, I would say strongly with our, our intention of our first principle.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.160
Uh, for sure.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.760
The way I'm, I'm, I'm trying to talk and read at the same time.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.360
I probably should not do that.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:14.250
Just so that everyone is aware, uh, if you're a new listener, I do think if

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:21.820
you're in a test role, I do think you improve your career by moving more to

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:31.060
a position of defining the actions based off of, uh, the decisions that your

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:37.740
information is informing, meaning a lot of testers go, our job is to just

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.260
inform the decision makers and I'm saying, why aren't you the decision maker?

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:47.780
That's even well, years before we thought of formalizing, at least modern testing.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.900
I've heard that statement and it's again triggered me.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.380
It's like, that's ridiculous.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.340
It's, it's very passive.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.500
Uh, this is, this came out of the context driven testing book is the

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.380
role of testing is to provide information period.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.620
Um, I'm probably paraphrasing and someone can come yell at me.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.940
And I thought that's a very passive approach.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.660
I think our role is like, get that information and then go

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.100
make something happen with it.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.980
And that's what I've always done.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:19.980
And probably, uh, why I'm still employed and paid too much, uh, is because it

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.620
isn't just about providing information.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.820
It's about figuring out what's the best way.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.900
So I kind of see, can I use best?

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:28.860
I'll use best there.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:35.100
Uh, by using principle number two, what's the best known way to mitigate that

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:43.180
risk bottleneck or that risk, uh, and often do it myself or make sure it gets done.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:48.620
Part of principle number seven is bringing that leadership aspect and attribute out

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.980
of whoever is driving modern testing principles on the team.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:58.000
And, and I want to pause for a second because some of these I've, I've

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.240
pushed back on a lot and, and said, uh, wrong.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.520
And I don't like it that way.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.720
Uh, I do want to commend, uh, Aaron and Luke for their, their work on this and

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.640
looking at one of the things I love about testers is we like to look at

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.520
systems and systems of systems.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.840
And they took these three sets of principles that exist in the internet

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:24.920
and, and figured out what they meant to them as individuals and their work and

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.720
made a nice summary of things that they believe in that drive the way they work.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.080
That's a hard thing to do.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:38.880
And overall it's, it's not like it doesn't make my blood boil or, or, or make me

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.120
think, oh, these are stupid.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.680
You should use modern testing principles instead.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.160
I don't feel that way at all.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.160
I think they, that would be dumb too.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:46.880
Yeah.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.840
Again, I, I encourage all of our listeners to go read these and

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.560
form your own opinions, but they asked for ours.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.760
And, uh, and if, if either one are listening and joining, if we have

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.560
five listeners this month, uh, please take this, uh, this, any critique

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.560
we've given as just our opinions and their opinions about the principles

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.960
and in our practices and what we believe, uh, and what we feel drives

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.440
us, what our principles are.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.840
And if there's conflict conflict is good.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.640
If they're not, I mean, you would, I think a lot worse feedback for us

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.680
or anyone to give is yeah, these look good.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.000
Keep on doing what you do.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.280
LGTM.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.760
I hate LGTM.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:42.390
Now the, and likewise, um, Alan and I on an MT, like we're not married to it.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:46.510
When something better comes along, we'll, we'll be the first to drop kick it.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:51.830
We haven't, we haven't found something that resonates as well.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.910
Um, yet, but it's just a matter of time.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:02.630
Uh, I firmly believe that it is, it, it is a best practice now, but it will

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.470
not be the best practice in the future.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:06.870
Like we said, they're not particularly modern.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.950
We just, we just grasp the things that were already there.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:11.230
These aren't forward looking.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.630
Uh, we just took some things that we saw that we're working and tried to

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.150
formalize them into some principles.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:21.180
And again, I've seen this on the podcast before, but when I first

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.460
started talking about modern testing principles in public, I got so many

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:30.340
comments to the flavor of thank you for putting a label on something I'm already doing.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.500
So we're not like inventing some North star people are migrating towards.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.940
No, it's like, Oh yeah, this describes what we do.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:37.260
Cool.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:37.620
Thanks.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.460
You know what the single most important thing that we're doing is.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:44.540
Um, breathing, forcing the conversation.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.300
Yes, we are forcing a conversation.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:52.940
And, and Aaron and Luke, they've, they've joined the conversation.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:53.860
Yes, they have.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.140
Welcome to our conversation.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.140
And I, I think it's fantastic.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:03.100
Uh, I hope that their conversation inspires other.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:03.620
Yeah.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.460
And we have seen, we haven't talked about it directly on the podcast, but there

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.980
are people speaking out sort of passive aggressively against modern testing

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.100
principles in a few cases.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.020
And I like that too.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.340
Welcome to the conversation.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.460
It makes us think it makes others think.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:21.020
Uh, I, I am thrilled when anyone even mentioned them.

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.260
So there've been a few conference talks, not by us on modern testing, which is

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:24.660
great.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:30.620
Uh, they come up in blog posts, uh, other forums online, which I think is great.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.140
So let's keep the conversation going.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:38.340
We're, we're not here to say follow our principles or you're wrong.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.700
That's not who we are or why we believe in them.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.200
We believe in our context.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.480
But we've, but everything we've done over the last couple of years, these

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.280
principles guide our decisions the way we work.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.560
I want to actually say it even stronger.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:52.680
Go for it.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.880
Don't follow any set of principles.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:06.000
Use them, think on them, be critical, come up with your own and act in that

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.760
direction until you find a better sets of principles to guide you, your

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.560
career, whatever you define success.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:20.760
Even stronger, blind faith in anything will wreck you.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:24.960
I can't go stronger.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:25.360
Sorry.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.680
All right.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.630
I would internet points are showering down on me.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.510
Hi, can you see like the, uh, the things floating down?

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:34.230
No.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.310
Okay.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.310
If Brent, I'm closing my eyes.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.350
I'll be like a listener.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.950
Then nobody else can see them.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.720
Uh, all right.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.840
So thanks.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:50.760
Uh, thank you very much, Aaron and Luke for giving us that, uh, conversation

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:51.640
topic for the podcast.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.480
Hope it was helpful, not just to you if you're listening, but to any

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.000
other listeners as well.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.600
Uh, anything else that you want to talk about before we close today, Brent?

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.680
No, we're over time.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.010
You don't have to tell them that they don't know.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:10.250
Cause when I edit this 50 minutes down, it's going to be like 12 minutes.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:15.010
Hey, it's good to be back.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:15.690
It is.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:16.010
It is.

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.330
It is.

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:16.610
It is.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.010
All right.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.930
Hopefully we'll be back again for one Oh eight and two weeks.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.770
That is the plan.

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:22.290
All right.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:23.370
I am Alan.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.570
I'm Brent and we'll see you next time.
