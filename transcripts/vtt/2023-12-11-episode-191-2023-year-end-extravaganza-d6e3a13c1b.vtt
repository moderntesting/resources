00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
Our job is to give the business what it needs, which sometimes it's what it's asking for.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.970
Yes. Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.650
Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.730
agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Everybody, it's Alan.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:36.450
And Brent. And we're here for the final 2023 episode of the A.B. Testing Podcast. Welcome to episode 191.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.910
191. Paladrome.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.590
It is. And I'm going to go right to the end here. This is our year-end episode, the national

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.710
tradition, where we talk about what we thought was going to happen last year. And one of us predicted

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.670
that the final episode of 2023 would be episode 192. And one of us predicted it would be episode 191.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.780
How is that for accuracy? But the winner is the winner's angry weasel because angry weasel is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.380
always right. And the funny thing is I said in the podcast and I didn't do as I said

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.420
191. And I'll be right because I have control over these things.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.930
But it happened. I want to go into it. Yeah, we're going to talk about.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.250
Now I understand why we had to push out the.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.460
You dropped out for a second. Hopefully that audio will come through whatever you said.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.220
Yeah, we have a lot to talk about. Go ahead.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.420
No, no, no. I was just about to say now I understand why Alan passive aggressively wanted

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.180
to push out the recording bite because we were originally going to do two recordings in December

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.020
and that would have made this next one 192. And that would have been our last.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.500
No, I gave you an option last week.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.660
I completely understand.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.820
I will post the text. I gave you an option.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.700
I only looked at the stats last night, Alan Page. Yeah. Okay. I get it. I get it. All right.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940
You take your way. You take your way.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.020
I will. I will. The winner is here. So what we do in this for those those who that are new listeners

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.500
is we're going to recap a little bit what happened. We're going to talk about shows. We like podcasts.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.940
We discovered things we liked in 2023 and then we'll make some predictions about 2024.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.370
We are not very good at predicting the future, but sometimes we're better than other times and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.810
we're going to see what happens. So before we get started on that, I'm going to go through our

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.610
wrapped our Spotify wrapped for 2023. Anything else going on? We should start any interesting

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.170
news and excitement. Are you still in review season at Microsoft or is that ended yet?

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.810
No, no. I am experiencing the performance boost from the team, an unexpected performance boost

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.640
from the team in holiday season. And I think this has a direct result of quality connect.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.910
Exercises to back up that point, there are plenty of studies showing high correlation between

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.700
engagement and I'll come back to that in a second because that's going to tie into what you said

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.620
between engagement and employee engagement, not getting married, engage with your jobs

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.260
and productivity, quality of that product, velocity, et cetera, et cetera. A lot of engagement just

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.860
comes from knowing why your job is important and getting feedback. So it would make sense that if

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.700
you have good discussions with your team that you will get they will do more better work.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.610
We are going to walk through our recap of the last year of AB testing podcast.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.290
AB testing podcast is hosted at anchor FM. This is not an ad for them, which eventually got bought

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.250
or was always owned by Spotify. I can't remember. So because Spotify gives you a year wrapped in

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:10.130
music, we get a year wrapped in what our podcast did. All right. Do you remember? What do you think?

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.490
I mean, you probably can't remember what our episodes were last year, but what do you think

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.370
our most popular episode was last year? Most popular episode, I'm guessing.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.680
Do you remember the names of any? You don't know the names because I named them after we

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.420
record them. So you wouldn't know, but the topic you'll remember.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.700
Brent being Brent as Brent looks to look at the names of our podcast from last year as he

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.370
launches Spotify. Well, no, because I already listened out the one we did with Brian, but would.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.570
Oh, that was that was a good one. I forgot Brian's last name. Talked about Strengths

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.130
Finders because you love Strengths Finders. Not our most popular podcast. Our most popular podcast

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.230
is, you know, people love our controversy, even though it's not controversy. It was episode 184

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.940
where we answered the question, is testing a dying profession? Oh, we, we, uh, we click

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:15.700
beat people on that one. Okay. Got it. It was, it was streamed 835% more than our average episode.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.480
So yeah, that got a little bit, uh, a little bit crazy. We have some new listeners this year.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.200
78% of our listeners discovered us in 2023. I don't know how true that is. They discovered us.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.120
This is all through Spotify. Spotify is all through Spotify. So it's not, it's,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.600
I think it are small numbers. These may be numbers may be skewed. So Spotify thinks

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:47.120
Spotify thinks we added like what 12% of our new listeners started listening at episode one,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.000
which is a really horrible idea. Do we decide like in the fifties is the right place to start?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.240
Uh, I think we said 67. I think so. It's, it's, it's under Slack channel.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.400
We get that question asked so often. I'm surprised we haven't hooked up the, uh,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.760
the auto bot thing. Oh, you know what? I can do that. Remind me. Okay. Someone remind me someone

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.040
post someone who's in our Slack group, you can go to moderntesting.org to join our Slack group.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.280
Talk a little bit more about that in a minute. But if you go there and remind me,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.840
I will set up the bot to automatically answer that question. Should it be asked

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.400
other interesting data? Uh, we, of course the blah, blah, blah. We were streamed in 66 different

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.200
countries. Um, the U S of course, being our top country, 20% of total streams, UK next, uh,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.720
no, Germany's next followed by the UK, Netherlands, and then India. Interesting.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.330
Yeah. That's what I thought. Interesting. Our listeners is good, but what else are they into

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.810
our top podcast genres among our listeners are comedy, technology and news. Uh,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.730
no, it doesn't. We provide really none of that. Uh, well, it depends on if you're laughing with

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:12.130
us or at us at yeah, I guess, you know, we provide entertainment for, you know,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:18.690
cleaning the toilet, emptying the cap box, things like that, right. Uh, something to distract you

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.930
from life's a more mundane or disgusting source. Certainly not much related to news. Absolutely.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:31.970
But unless news is an acronym, but I'm guessing not. Here's a weird thing. 12% of our users shared

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:40.850
our podcast over WhatsApp and our most shared episode was episode 178 on testing versus quality.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.090
Our podcast rating is 4.6. That's I think out of five and not 10, but either way.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:56.580
Wait, one 78 is not testing versus quality. Well, that's what Spotify told me. What was the

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:02.510
number for testing versus quality? Oh, I'm, I need to get my eyes checked. It is 178. I was.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:08.510
Okay. So you're just, you're just dumb. No, the 176, the six look like an eight.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:14.050
I'm just blind. Not though. Well, I could be both. I'm going to go with the latter.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:23.390
Fair. Just to be fair and transparent to our, our listeners. We grew 11% in listeners,

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:30.110
13% in streams. I'm not sure what the difference really is and 55% in followers. I'm not really

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.270
sure what a follower is. Someone could explain that to me. I think it's when you don't really know

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.590
when you just click the stupid little automatic algorithm with lots of little pictures tells me,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:48.210
uh, we were a top 10 podcast for 500 people, 502 people, 500 people need to get a life.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:56.370
Better podcasts out there. I, I, that is wrong. You could be getting so much more value from your

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:04.450
listening time. We were a top five podcast for 355 fans. And no, I never listened to our podcast

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:10.030
after I published it. So I'm not inflicting the numbers. Uh, the three, the three listeners are,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:17.310
are going crazy. But here is the really scary part for some of our listeners out there. We love you

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:24.030
all three of you, and we would have nothing to talk about without you. But there are so many

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.510
good podcasts out there. We're going to talk about a few in a minute, but we are the number

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:36.500
one, listen to podcasts for 108 people. Wow. Please give some advice to those people.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:43.840
There are also on Spotify, plenty of podcasts around self help improvement,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:52.220
feeling better about yourself. Yeah. You know, um, maybe, maybe,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.220
I don't want to, I gotta be careful here. I don't want to go dangerously over the line.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:05.950
Yeah. Uh, we love the listeners. We appreciate it. We're only joking, right? Because we don't

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:15.630
understand it with our bar. Like we're old QA folks and we absolutely know the quality, uh,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:24.030
is not there with the podcast, but those who we do, we do provide, right? The community is fantastic.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:31.230
If nothing else, I would say the AB testing podcast has created just a fantastic community.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.050
Yeah. I changed my mind. I'm not going to, I'm not going to say anything.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:42.850
Brant's right. Fine. Fine. I'm better at self-deprecation. We, uh, thinking of our

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.770
community and I mentioned going to modern testing.org to get a link to our Slack group.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:54.770
As of last year at this time, we had 864 people in our Slack of the three, probably the three people,

00:10:54.770 --> 00:11:02.370
you know, 200 times each year before we had 742, we are up to 951. So Brent, are you ready for the

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:10.690
first prediction of the 2023 year end AB testing pod? Oh, I can already guess. Yes. I'm ready.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:17.630
What day and I'll put it on my calendar to check closest to closest to the pin wins.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:26.030
What day will we have 1000 members in the general channel? Do we have the way to figure that out?

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.970
No, it's a guess, man. No, do we? Yeah. Yeah. I can, I can see how many are in there.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.450
I will set a count. I'll, I'll watch it and make an announcement when we're there,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.210
but today we're going to pick a date. So you said, what's the current number?

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:49.070
The current number is 951. As of last night. And it was what? 864 a year ago.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:58.530
All right. February 29th. I went a little farther and just, I put mine in ahead of you.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:04.370
I said May 10th for no reason. I like Feb 29. I will put calendar reminders to check and I'll,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:10.050
I'll watch that throughout there. I think you're right that if we're going to get to a thousand,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.810
it'll be on the push of this episode, maybe getting people to tell friends about it,

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.810
hoping that'll balance the people leaving the pot, the slack group.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.530
Yeah. What was the stat that you said the first stat that 78% of our listeners

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:31.950
first, first listened in 2023, which I think is skewed by that means they first listened on

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.510
Spotify is what I think that really comes out to. So that's not totally true. But if you're

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.030
listening to the podcast and you have questions about it, you want to know how it applies.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.110
You want to talk to other people who are trying to apply modern testing principles.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:51.470
Get out there and join our slack group. It's free. It will remain free. It's so free that

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:57.230
the messages roll off after 60 days or whatever, because I can't afford to pay for slack because

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:02.350
they have their business model stupid. They either have free or pay a gazillion dollars.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:09.550
If I could pay 50 bucks a month to have some features that will come with the

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:15.310
paid for slack that would work for a nonprofit like AB testing slack, I would do this, but

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.190
you don't cause you're dumb. I love you. I hate you, et cetera. So anyway,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:29.520
join the slack group, drive the numbers up, hit a thousand or, or, or don't, but wait until April

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:39.090
or may and do it then. Whatever you do you just, just a slight push. Hey, do you, do you know

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.850
what I'm speaking as a Spotify, I was gonna ask this earlier. Do you listen to Spotify?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.810
You use Spotify for your music. What does your rap say? What's your number one artist of 2023?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:55.600
Uh, I played a thousand 91 songs. Uh, getting to the, uh, I'm too lazy to pull mine up. I just

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.320
remember it. Mine's pretty obvious. No, it's not actually obvious. It's my number one,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.520
my number one band is a band we haven't talked about on here because I absolutely love their

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:14.480
latest album. My number one was acoustic alchemy. I remember that group. They, they are my go-to

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:23.490
when I need to fake mindfulness. And it says my peak listening month was April. I was surprised

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.970
when it said that was my number one, but there was a time early in the year where

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:34.590
those bad boys were on repeat, but followed it. I'll give you my number two and number three

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:42.900
fallout boy. Number two in weezer number three. Oh yeah. Interesting. Interesting.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:48.820
So I don't have mine up. I know that arcade fire were number one for me because they had a new album

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:55.780
come out in late 2022 actually, but I listened to the crap out of it throughout the year.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.060
Number two, and there's some caveats on these because I'll tell you why in a minute.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:06.340
Number two was bowling for soup and number three was actually Taylor Swift. And the reason,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.740
I don't know if you do this or not, but my whole family, well, meaning my wife and I,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:21.460
really, we use our Amazon smart devices to play music all the time. But my wife and I listened to

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:28.100
overlapping, but varied artists. She had the nerve to tell him to ask me,

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.260
why does anyone listen to Bob Dylan? She slept on the porch that night.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:40.100
Two in the morning all about the magic of Bob Dylan. So what I have is I have a Spotify family

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:47.060
account and I have a Amazon device only. I'm not saying the name on purpose. So when we ask the

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:54.660
Amazon device to play a song, it uses a non-existent family member named Amazon to play that. So I should

00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.340
look at that user's rap to some point and see what won out among our listening because that's what I

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.460
listen to. I'm taking a shower or in the kitchen cooking a lot of times, although now I have my

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.180
record player and my vinyl collection in there. So not as much. But anyway, so it gets a little

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:16.980
weird. So it's really just stuff that I listened to in my office. It's the same for me. My whole

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:24.980
home is wired. All the devices in my home are wired to a generic Spotify account.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:34.450
And then my devices are to my account. So I haven't looked at that that wrapped either.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:40.610
Where was a music wrapped? I wrote one sentence to describe my 2022. I should have given you

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.490
homework to do this yourself, but you wouldn't have done it. I wrote down off the top of my

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:52.190
head in 2022. I started blogging again at angry weasel.substack.com. I changed jobs,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:58.750
believe it or not. I left Unity and joined the new company. I got COVID for the first time

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:05.390
and I walked all the way around Mount Rainier. Not a bad year. What do you look back on in 2022,

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:12.990
Brett? So honestly, I look back on 2022. I'll come clean on the podcast at some point in time.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:22.880
Not now. The only thing that I think about is I survived. I survived and I'm surviving

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:30.240
the current life change that I'm undergoing that you are aware of. And everything else is a

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:39.840
bloody blur. Understood. Understood completely. I do think back to 2023 and definitely think

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:50.900
it sucked way less than 2022. Yeah, I think so even though I got COVID.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.420
And I think I said 2022 at the top. It's 2023 looking back. I did those things.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:07.310
Some questions from last year. Did you do any art this year? I did. Not much, but I did.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:17.150
I had one project and I had one project that I really wanted to get done. I got it done.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:23.570
I have not done show and tell. So I picked the wrong one.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.690
It's podcast. Nobody's going to see. Yeah, it's just for you.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:35.170
You know what? I know that in 2021, you had done quite a bit and tapered off in 2022,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.810
but I'm glad it didn't stop completely and that you're still doing it. That's great.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:43.170
I'm still doing it. I have purchased a whole bunch of gear. I'm waiting for

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:51.730
one more thing to come and I'm going to get back into it. I got all kinds of new technical stuff.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.890
Definitely plenty on getting back into it. Very cool. Very cool. Let's talk. We're getting

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:02.370
in predictions here in about 10 minutes, but the original, let's look back a little bit on

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:09.810
the entertainment of 2023. Let me get the years right here. What did you stream? Did you watch

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.970
things? What do you recommend from the world of streaming and television entertainment?

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:25.540
I just, oh, okay. I will tell you the absolute thing that has been a huge passion at our

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:31.870
household, the anime Demon Slayer. Oh, I should ask my daughter about that.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:40.140
I'm going to write that down. It is great. My daughter got me into it.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:48.380
Now it's at a point where I'm like, what do you mean you're going to bed? I'm the parent here.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.260
We've got another episode to watch. Which streaming network is that on?

00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:01.500
Hulu. Okay, got it. They announced season four just last week. Apparently, it's not going to

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:08.540
come until probably 2025. I'm like, damn it. There'll be other things. I'm going to add that

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:17.420
to my list. Thanks for that. What else? I started watching the prequel to Game of Thrones.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:24.220
Oh yeah. Yeah. New season just came out, right? I don't know. It's hard to keep up. I'm going

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:31.420
through it slowly. It's not attracting my attention nearly as much. I'm spending a lot more

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:43.740
time on YouTube nowadays. Joshua Weisman, he's kind of a... Do you know who Alton Brown is?

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:50.940
I know that name. Where do I know that from? Alton Brown was well known for a show called

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:59.420
Good Eats. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. What I loved about him is he spent more time explaining

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:05.740
why recipes work. He honestly walked you through how to do things, but it wasn't just like watch

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:12.300
two random people cook things in front of you. He explained the science behind it, so I always

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:18.940
liked that. Oh, I would like that too. Joshua Weisman is the closest thing I've seen to a Gen Z

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:28.140
version of it. He's damn funny, really enjoying it. As well as Uncle Roger, who's now become a

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:35.420
meme. Are you adjusting your... So yeah, there is... Joshua Weisman is fantastic. Uncle Roger on

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:44.780
YouTube is fantastic. I was addicted early on to Davey504, who's just this one guy who's just

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:55.710
a killer bass player. I mean, he's a phenomenal bass player, but on shows like the usual thing,

00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:03.710
I am absolutely maintaining. I'm up to date on everything Marvel, everything Star Wars.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:11.780
Although there's nothing really... My daughter and I were really excited about Loki season two.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:19.380
I liked it. I liked it. Did you? Yeah, I did. I'm like, okay, so he becomes the...

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:30.560
No spoilers? Okay, I liked it. The thing happens, and I'm like, really? Really? I'm not even gonna

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:37.280
say why really, but... I thought it was a... I thought it was a reasonable ending to that season.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.760
I just finished Loki like literally a couple days ago. I have just started Secret Invasion,

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.560
and then I'll be all cut up on Marvel. I'm still a series behind on Star Wars,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.560
which series? What was the one that just came out recently? I can't even keep track. There was the

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.880
one... I don't remember the name. The Mandalorian? No, I'm kind of a Mandalorian. There was something

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:06.400
just came out, right? Not just, but like four or five months ago. All right, we'll find it

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.480
a little bit. I'll dig it up here. I was looking at my list, and I realized everything that I

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:19.440
really liked this year was stuff that... Well, there were new seasons this year, but it came out.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.920
There were sequels and things. Invincible, of course, I've talked about before. New season is out.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:30.640
I'm not quite done with season two yet. I just think it's a really cool show. The Bear? Did you

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:37.440
ever watch The Bear? Ahsoka? Ahsoka? That's the one I haven't watched yet. Okay. All right. Did

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.640
you ever watch The Bear? No. So The Bear, New Seasons Out, I loved. I think they did a fantastic job on

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.760
that with the character development and having people grow in the different ways. I'll leave it

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:57.600
at that. And then I totally binged The Morning Show on Apple TV all three seasons. And I thought

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:04.080
both Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston were fantastic in that. I think I really got sucked

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.840
into it. And I think we watched all three seasons over the space of a month. It was ridiculous.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.920
I enjoyed that a lot. On YouTube, what do I watch? I watch hiking videos and things like that.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:22.930
Anything else? Sometimes some sounders highlights. I think there's a new season of Welcome to Reksum

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:31.170
on Hulu, which I have not watched yet, but I do watch the weekly Reksum highlights that Ryan

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:36.690
Reynolds team he owns. That falls into my list. But other than that, it's kind of random.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:48.430
The HBO Max, I have really begun to get addicted to a show called Last Week Tonight by John Oliver.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:59.300
Kind of like in the Stephen Colbert type bent of a news commentary. I'll say

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:08.340
whether you agree or disagree, he's still funny AF. Yeah, I think that covers it on my side.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.540
What I want to talk about now, a couple of our predictions from last year, I want to revisit,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.200
get your opinions on. And then we'll do a little bit of what do we think is going to happen in

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.680
2024. And then we'll wish everybody a happy holiday and happy new year. I got to a few of these

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:35.200
already, but I want to quote you from a prediction from last year. Remember, this is December 2022.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.120
And there was a fairly new thing out called Chat GPT. We didn't even know at the time how much it

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.080
would be part of our conversations throughout the year, but we were playing with it. We had a hunch.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:52.800
And you said, Chat GPT will be the fastest online service ever to bring in $1 billion in revenue.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:59.120
And didn't it do that? I'm going to go with, I am a dentist scientist, but if I don't look,

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:05.600
then I can't be wrong. I'm going to go with yes, absolutely. And I asked what's the revenue model,

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.760
because I didn't know that. I mean, I pay for it. I pay my $20 a month for

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:18.560
access to dolly three and GPT for for sure. I'm paying for that myself. I don't even know the

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.760
price tag, because I honestly, at the moment, I'm not certain I care.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:30.880
The other thing that came up was talking about Chat GPT and the modern testing principle that

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.880
I sent this to you. You've seen these. I'm going to share them with the group here.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.880
But you wondered out loud, hey, we're talking about modern testing principles and detractors.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.960
I don't know if, in hindsight, I wouldn't call the people that think the principles are harmful

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:53.600
to testing detractors. They just have a different approach. I think we very much care about quality

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.320
and delivery. And some people have called our, including myself, have called our principles

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.960
delivery principles rather than testing principles. But you all know where they came from.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.240
They're not modern. They're not testing. It was just us talking about how do,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.280
what does it look like once we get out of traditional testing? So go ahead.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:23.090
To me, it hasn't really connected this succinctly for me until you just said this.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:30.560
To me, the modern testing principles, in essence, states the modern tester

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.320
cares more about quality than about testing.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.420
Yeah. And that's the difference. LinkedIn, it's interesting,

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:46.540
stays filled with conversations that aren't URI. And often from devs, there's a dev,

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:52.860
Brian Finster, who basically embodies modern testing, but it came from development. He talks

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:58.380
about how devs should own their testing and testers jump in and say, no, you need a specialist

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.900
to ensure that the customer has the right solution. And he just laughs at him. And he's

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:10.780
very good debater. And I love seeing folks out there like they get it, but it's fun.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:16.300
Fine. I mean, testers is testing a dying profession. Yes, but it's going to take a long,

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:23.410
long time. But you wondered out loud. Hey, I wonder if I, I'll do my best Brent imitation.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:28.770
I wonder if I can get chat GPT to write rewrite the principles and the voice of art attractors.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:34.270
And I, I heard that I did my research. I listened to that and I thought, oh,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.920
Jason Arbin made a really cool thing that knows all about all these people. I'm going to go ask

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.080
his little thing. And you have to have chat GPT for it to do this or the paid version. But

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.840
I said, no other context. I said, rewrite the modern testing principles as if Michael Bolton,

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.200
James Bach wrote them. They're too long to read every little bit here, but it did a pretty

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.920
good job. Again, it's a different approach. It's not, they would never write the things

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.240
that we wrote because they're, they care about different things. But what they came up with,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:13.170
I think is super fair. And I'm going to go through all of them. First one, focus on the

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:18.210
business through skeptical inquiry. Now use critical thinking to question the status quo

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.890
and uncover the real needs of the business. I think there's, there's value in that.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:26.930
Oh, I, I don't know that they would state that, but I, I absolutely.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:32.210
I don't know if they would either. I bet. And I'm not going to, I'm just, you know,

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:39.010
chat GPT is not putting words in their mouth, but they did a good job taking the principle we had,

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:44.530
you know, our priorities, improving the business and then kind of lensing it through RST.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:54.960
I will absolutely state that I absolutely believe. And just as just to use absolutely one more

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:03.200
time in the sentence that that, that last sentence is absolutely important. Right. I tell my,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.680
I tell my team, for example, our job is to give the business what it needs,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.160
which sometimes it's what it's asking for. Yes. Yeah. I do want to get quickly through these,

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.560
but yeah, we talked about eliminating bottlenecks, identifying and limiting bottlenecks.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.080
The lens on this one is emphasize individual skills over processes, which is a little weird,

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.800
but we can get into the text. It says recognize the values of things like lean thinking,

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.960
the stress, the importance of the individual testers skills and intuition, identifying,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.680
addressing bottlenecks, continuous improvement through it. We talked about being continuous

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:43.280
improvement. They say continuous improvement through exploratory testing, which I think is fair.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.680
Well, what do you mean by fair? It's a fair amalgam. Is that what you're commenting on?

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.320
I think it's a fair view of that principle through the lens. What this has done here,

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.320
which is kind of a genius of the, the, the generative AI is taken our principle and says,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:07.200
what would this mean? What would this principle mean under this RST lens and changed it? And

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.600
to be something closer to what they would say. And of course, James and Michael,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.880
if you're listening to this, thank you. Thank you for joining the conversation.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.000
We're in different places in the world here. So if you're mad at this stuff, tell me and we'll

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.280
have a discussion about it. Totally fine. I just wanted to clarify that you weren't necessarily

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:32.480
making a statement of whether or not you would agree with the, yeah, I just, this is our fourth

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.200
principle talks about the quality culture. They say nurture a culture of quality through critical

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:43.040
thinking text around that. Like that's again, I think that's, that makes sense from that RST

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.720
perspective. We talk about the customer's only one to evaluate the quality of the product. And the

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:54.080
art and the version here is respect the customer's perspective that validate independently while

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.960
recognizing that the customer is a crucial judge of product quality, maintain an independent critical

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.560
stance and evaluating quality, questioning both the product and customer assumptions.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:08.320
I think what this one does is it takes our view like the customer and I truly believe this only

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.800
the customer can truly evaluate quality. We can't fake it for them, but it actually applies

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:19.120
their stance of critical distance and their stance that they do have to defend the customer.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:27.440
Yeah. The only thing that's triggers for me is, is realizing that there's, that there's yet again,

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:33.760
another ambiguity with, with our principle five, like you and I are on the same page,

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:40.640
but we also think in terms of system thinking. So we're probably interpreting number five the same.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:48.080
Right. I don't, I don't view number five necessarily meaning, uh, the customer's always right.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.880
I don't interpret it that I interpreted as the customer is the judge,

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:59.680
but sometimes the customer will say things and do different things. Correct. Correct. And, and,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:06.800
and for me, the definition of quality would involve at minimum the overlap between those two

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.040
sets of things. Yeah. And for number six, we talk about the importance of data and we use data to

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.600
make decisions. And I like, like if I was a tester, like if I was a dedicated tester and I wanted to

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.920
follow the principles in a way that took advantage of my critical thinking and my tester mindset,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:32.000
air quotes abound, uh, they say use data as a guide, not an answer, employ data extensively

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.800
to understand customer usage, but treat it as a guide for exploration and questioning rather

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.840
than a definitive answer, which I think is good. And there was a time in my career when this is

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:49.600
what I would do. I would look at our, I would use the customer usage patterns to help me determine

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.520
where I should spend more time testing. Like if I said they're spending a lot of time here,

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.640
seem to be struggling, I would go test the crap out of that thing. So I think there is from an

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.000
exploratory point of view. And I think a lot of exploratory testers want to ignore that data

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.120
because they, they can feel like they don't need it or it's maybe they don't want to go find it.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.760
This is just based on experience, not actually an evaluation of the world of software testers,

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:20.240
but that data is available by all and your, in your job, your, you identify as an exploratory

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.680
tester. Yeah, I would say by all means take that data and use it as a guide to do better

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:32.400
testing based on what customers are actually doing. Let me give you a pop quiz of sorts. How

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:41.200
would you stack rank the following options, data only intuition only or both? Obviously both. Both

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.960
data intuition. Okay, we are on same page. Not surprising. That was an easy question.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.920
Yeah, no, I know. I was just thinking through because use data as a guide, not an answer.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:59.840
Now you, you, what you asked it to do is rewrite, essentially rewrite our principles,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.440
leveraging the philosophies learned by, by the other two gentlemen. And I think this is

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.800
doing the right thing, right? I don't think, I don't think we actually disagree with this.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.840
No, I think it's interesting that puts that take on it. And this is why, again,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.920
I want to go back and say that a lot of people who are poo pooing, like this, I think

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:26.880
is a valid and interesting and thought provoking use to generative AI. I use gen AI to help me

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.840
think differently about things. The people that complain about it say like, oh, it can't do math.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:36.480
It can't sort things alphabetically. It does. Like I don't want it to do those things. I know

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.400
how to do those things in fricking Excel. What I wanted to do is prompt it in a way

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.280
that helps me think about things differently. And that's why I pay for us. Why use it? That's

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.000
why it's totally worth it for me. Our last principle in the modern delivery slash testing

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.560
principles is around not wanting dedicated specialists. And Brian Finster on LinkedIn

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.520
talks a lot about the problem, which is great. I don't know Brian, never met him,

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.240
but I like what he has to say. The lensed version here is expand test testing capabilities

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.160
through skill development, encourage the development of testing abilities across the team,

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.560
but focus on enhancing individual skill sets and critical thinking abilities over process

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.640
adherence, which is very similar to one of the other answers. But the last thing,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.240
let's just for some framing say in this reinterpretation, the principles reflect

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.960
a more critical individual focused approach consistent with their philosophies and RST

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.800
emphasize the importance of skills, skepticism in the role of the individual tester and

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.960
questioning improving software quality. So I think it did a good job at that. I don't think,

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.160
I do not think to be clear that Bocken Bolton would write a set of principles like this,

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.640
nor would they even believe entirely in what was written here. But I was impressed in the

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:51.120
ability of Gen AI to take something that's really not at all like RST and take the,

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.080
the essence of each of the principles and twist it in that world. I thought it was just

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:04.880
really amazing. Yeah, it did. Like, like, as, as I've said here before, GPT is currently the

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:12.610
world's best parent and it can parrot all sorts of fun things. The moving on the last

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.690
prediction that I did not come true is every year I say I'm going to get to Cole Forest

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:21.730
on the podcast and every year I don't, but I'm going to predict the game for 2024.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:26.770
I also have another prediction for 2024 that I've been thinking about a lot.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:32.400
I am going to be a part of trying to make your prediction come true.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.480
Okay. I, uh, okay. So Gen AI it's long, of course, everything's about gen. Gen AI.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:47.440
You are a big co-pilot fan and I thought you said you were. So I think, so co-pilot is a generic

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:56.640
term. Uh, it, uh, depending on the context, co-pilot, I'll just say I am, my actions and my words

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:04.670
at work are very much polarizing on that topic. Okay. So I think, so here's the challenge.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:12.030
Something I tell teams a lot is you can use co-pilot and use these, these tools to help you

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:18.190
understand how to write, generate code. And this is not, you know, code generation of visual studio

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:24.030
five, whatever it was with templates and things don't check in what you don't understand. And

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:29.790
here's what I think is going to happen. And this is important for people who identify as testers,

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:36.270
as well as developers, we are going to see a lot more use of generated code, uh, in our applications.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:46.800
And I don't know, I think it can happen in 2024 where the ability to read code and understand it

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:54.240
becomes more important than the ability to write code. I think code reading and discernment and

00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:00.720
evaluation and code review of computer generated code is going to become a critical skill due to

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.720
the massive increase in generated code. I totally see where you're coming from. Uh,

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:14.240
if it weren't for one thing, I think I would wholeheartedly agree with you. I'm only half

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:22.240
heart, maybe, you know, 80% heartedly agree with you. And that is, and that is

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.880
GPT is a fantastic interpreter of code. By the time we get second half of the year,

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.200
we're going to see articles about this and we will see what happened, but that's my prediction.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.640
No, I can hear you now, man. What do you think is going to happen? What do you think is going

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:42.800
to happen in 2024? Well, so let me, let me go back to what I just said. Have you ever taken

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:49.040
a snippet of code into GPT and asked it, what does this do? I think I have, and it does really well.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:59.200
It does phenomenally. So I definitely see GPT coming more and more integral. I'm in fact,

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:06.800
encouraging my, my, my still my daughter that's at home to, to get more familiar,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.640
get more accustomed to it. Cause I do think that is going to be an ever increasing skill.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:19.760
I will, my, I'm going to state a prediction and it's one that honestly, Alan, I hope

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:25.620
doesn't come true, but I believe it will. And that is, I do think we will see

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:33.390
the first API next year. Ooh, fun stuff. That will be a game changer.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:43.060
I mean, this, it will pull any of that game changer. I'm just like, yeah, the word game is not.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.380
Fair enough. It's interesting that both of our predictions are around AI.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.740
Well, so we haven't gone through what our favorite episode was this last year. And

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.540
I tell you, we can do that. We can do, I have a couple of things for the rapid fire around.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:06.020
No. Okay. I'll just say, I'll just say mine on the favorite episode. Unless you have that in,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:11.280
no, let's go there. Favorite episode. The one where we talked about chat GPT.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.200
Wasn't that was all of them.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:23.040
There was actually one where you titled, uh, shockingly we don't talk about AI or something

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.640
like that this episode.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:34.240
Brent reads the show notes. It's so cool. I did do that once. Yeah. We, I think we can't not talk

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:42.480
about it. AI is part of how we get work done now. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, there is a scenario.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:48.400
Like there's a scenario that I, so you and I have talked about this before, like the,

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:54.240
the Mark 20 quote, I was going to write you a short, short letter, but it was taking too long.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.720
So I worked your long one instead. Right. Right. I didn't have enough time for a long one instead.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:05.520
Yes. Right. I have found a strategy to solve that problem using GPT, which is,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.760
so let's say you're writing an email. They are responding to an email and it's one

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:22.670
that I'll just give you a hypothetical. Hey, GPT, I'll paste, paste the email thread into GPT

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:32.270
and then give it a prompt of write it a polite influencing response to this email that covers

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:37.150
the following three points. And I'll lay out the points that are really important to me and

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:43.710
assist me. And then of course it will do it. And then I'll review it, make sure I like it.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:52.430
And then I'll then give it an example of my writing style and tell it to now rewrite that

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:58.670
in my writing style. Well, oh my God, is it good at that? And the point is that should all be

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:04.270
automatic. One, I don't like chasing my, my company emails into, you know, open AI.chat,

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:09.150
but it was company. Right. Okay. So here's the deal. That should all happen automatically.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:18.670
You should automatically, as I reply to emails, it should be training itself on how I reply to

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:24.610
things and the language that I feel is cringy. No, I want it to do it. Cause here's what I want.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:30.690
Here's what I want. Chat GPT to do. I want to look at things before I even see them and it,

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:35.170
and reply with things like this feels like a conversation that would be bet more

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:40.960
applicable to Slack or Teams. Like I'm so tired of getting discussions in email. I want to get

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:48.000
my email walk cleaned out. I hate email conversations. Email is for sharing information

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.800
and meeting requests. And I want my AI to enforce that for me, but I like it. I think it could be

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:57.600
cringy. It could be cool, but this is, I mean, is this what Office Co-Pilot is going to do?

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.940
Probably one day. This is where the place was where I said, I'm some places. I'm not a fan of

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:09.140
co-pilot. Some places I. Quick rapid fire. And then we got to go. So favorite episodes one with chat

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.060
GPT for me, it's quality versus testing. Who do you want to have on as a guest next year for me?

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.650
It's Nicole for his good and go. Nicole. Absolutely. Nicole. I already said that you

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.890
got to give me your own one. All right. Taylor Swift.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:27.090
You said rapid fire and you already limited my top one. So.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:34.690
Oh my God, you're awful. Okay. What will be our, Oh, on what day will we hit? That's too easy. We're

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:39.890
going to get to episode 200 this year. That's for sure. Barring any, you know, major problems,

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:46.130
but we're, this is going to be episode 191. What episode will we be talking about next year?

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:50.380
Like what will be our final episode of 2023? Sorry, 2024.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:45:01.490
I think there's two possibilities here and I'm going to go with 210 or 201.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.960
Yeah. 210 or 201. Okay.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.840
Tell me why. I already written down 211, but tell me why.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:20.720
Oh, I went with 210 because it's, you know, two one. Oh, 201. I see that as a possibility

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:29.760
because I recall that you are planning on going on a non trivial soul searching

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:36.800
hike around the universe. That was originally the plan, but, uh, with, you know, job changes and

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.880
kids and things, uh, it's going to be postponed for a little bit. I'm not sure what I'm going

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.200
to do that. Okay. But yeah, that would have been right after 201. Yeah. That was originally the

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:51.660
plan. Good memory. The thing is, the thing is, is I'm like, okay, I don't know when he's coming

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:57.580
back, but I'm certainly not letting them go until we recorded. Yeah. To bring that up.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:03.980
Episode. Cause then that would be, as you know, my two hunt. Yep. Yep. It's all about me.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.980
It is. It is all about you. I'm not let the universe tell me what to do with my life.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:13.180
There. That's what I'm going to do. I got to run, but this was a good look back, good look forward,

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.180
some good ideas. I'm going to hope that, uh, our software does the right thing here,

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:22.860
but this has been episode one 91, our last episode of 2022 happy holidays, everyone. I'm Alan.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.790
I'm Brent and we'll talk to you next year.
