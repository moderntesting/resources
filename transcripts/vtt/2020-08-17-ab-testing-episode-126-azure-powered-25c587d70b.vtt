00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.700
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey we're back for another

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:30.260
episode of I forgot what's this podcast called something Bart Bart

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.260
there's a thing ago when I first met Brent and I was sort of the chief of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.300
staff for this test leadership meeting and Brent would show up there and I would

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.220
mess with his name just to see if he was paying attention he loved it he was

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:58.620
Brett Brent Burt Bobby Sue I don't know yeah it's it is a challenge to come up

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.260
with something uniquely insulted or insulting with with my first name well I

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.060
had a colleague in college by the way this is the AB testing podcast and I'm Alan

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.380
and he's some name starts with a B I went to college with a trumpet player named

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.940
Doug Burt last name B-E-R-G-T and it was so easy to call him his name was Doug

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.850
Burt little flippy flop bug dirt he did not like that name I don't think that's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.790
like there's a lot worse names to call someone right apparently Donald is one

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.870
of them as an example yes that is a name that is like nobody's gonna be naming

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.750
their kids Donald anymore that's for sure no or Karen Donald and Karen those

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.110
names just aren't used anymore yeah yeah the the Karen meme whoo

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.390
certainly not in the next six months are we gonna see too many Karen's being born

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.590
I think yeah and I think if the Phoenix project takes off like it should no one

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.900
will name their kid Brent either because Brent is synonymous with bottleneck which

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.500
is weird because you're not but I'm afraid you're going to be overthrown by

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.660
the by the power of media again you you're saying I'm not because you mostly

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660
talked to me right I mean if you should talk to my team I don't know that they

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.940
would agree with that statement a matter of fact actually that's one of my biggest

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.860
my team's grown in size and we got a bunch of new people on here and and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.300
these are like green horns straight out of college and one of the things I am I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.740
have a couple of them that really struggle with decision-making and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.580
they're like oh well I had this really myopic decision can I set up an hour

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.660
meeting with you so we can go through it oh no no you can't no you cannot please

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.820
send me please send me a message and I'll look at it yeah what was I gonna say

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.740
oh a couple things that reminds me of the topic I wanted to talk about today

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.300
but there's I need context so we are live-streaming once again and once

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.350
again last-minute apologies I we were not going to live stream this one because we

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.230
hit we're going until about 15 minutes ago going to have a guest on the show

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.990
and I did not want to subject them to that madness however that changed I

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.230
won't give away the guest it's gonna be fantastic but they had to reschedule at

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.350
the last minutes just Brent and I and I think we came up with a pretty good

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.030
agenda on the fly as we usually do I am super excited about the guests but we are

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.710
live-streaming and it's last minute the next time we live stream I promise I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.110
will try I promise that I will try to get an announcement up in our slack

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.900
group which you can join if it's called one of the three dot slack calm there's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.460
an invitation link on the podcast website and probably the easiest way to

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.700
get there is to go to modern testing org where you can read the modern

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:20.580
testing principles and yeah yeah yeah so all that intro to episode 126 I believe

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:28.560
aside my calendar so the corona calendar bump as I call it was just beginning to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.640
subside and then as I mentioned last time on the podcast my org is growing adding

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.310
some additional technical program managers not product managers Brent

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.790
program managers to my org also I have added so we merged a big parts of two

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.390
parts of unity together I have added additional DevOps engineers to my role

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.430
essentially doubling the size of that team I have expanded the size of my

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.510
documentation team that's about doubled as well and I've added a few other odds

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.630
and ends to my org in fact longtime listeners of the podcast will know that

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:17.910
four or five abt 343 ago I had Melissa Eden on the recording talking about what

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.030
she's doing at unity I originally hired her to work for me on my team when I was

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.330
director of QA for services and when I moved away she moved to another dev

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.990
director did some really great things and part of this reorg is I get her

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.190
back oh the long-term plan is there so Melissa so Melissa works for me again

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.190
she is already kicking butt super excited so my org is a little bigger and then

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.550
also because I manage the matrix and my boss came up with a good description for

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.550
what I do that I don't think I've shared before but it stuck with me I run the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.790
engineering operating system so if you think of engineering as an OS that it's

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.680
like all of the I make all the systems go Brent does not like that no no no no

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.920
if you're on the podcast you won't know this but Brent doesn't like that but it

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.560
but it actually makes sense what do you mean I don't like that you made a face

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.640
like I can tell when you're making a face because normally you're like this

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.440
level ugly and you were like a new level I go oh Brent taking it taking it

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.800
to 11 so because I'll to comment on that in a minute but the point was

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.560
because of that and going back to your schedule time with you so many meetings

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.120
my calendar has because people want to go I need to touch me every single new

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.240
lead in the org hey I need to know how things work can we have some time

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.960
together and I go sigh yes here's some pre-reading because I've already

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.960
documented everything you're gonna ask but the introduction and the face time

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.440
is good so I am meeting with a lot of people across the org which is good I'm

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.720
not complaining too much about it I'm not complaining about the people I love

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.120
talking to the people it helps get things done what I'm complaining about is the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.960
45 hours of week 45 hours a week I have in meetings for the next three weeks yeah

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.660
no tell me about your face it everything you just said said kind of

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.260
aligns if you are you know director of the engineering OS you're essentially the

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.940
chief cat herder actually yes I'm I'm sometimes I call myself chief nagging

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:41.120
officer yeah I like that the CNO I just try and I try and help people make good

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.900
yeah it's it's very much a process problem when a lot of those regards it's

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:53.580
it's I actually think cat herder is a great how do you how do you enable the

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:59.020
right amount of autonomy because as we know command and control sucks you are

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.060
you are absolutely in a position to evoke all kinds of evil with respect to command

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:12.000
and control absolutely I actually am one of the few people in the entire org me

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.360
and the people that run our SRE business or SRE operations who actually can carry

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.200
a process hammer and I am very careful in where I you find nails and hammer

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:30.720
them yeah yeah the thing I the thing I mean the thing I like about you being in

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:40.000
that role is is you know the responsibility and you know that if I if

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.180
you could get business converged autonomy down at the root level you're gonna

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:53.980
you're gonna create an environment of awesome however as you call out you can't

00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:00.800
be afraid to to use command and control not liberally what's the opposite

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.000
carefully I wouldn't call a command and control it's adding just enough process

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.680
it's putting up some bumper rails where he needed so teams can stumble towards

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:20.680
success right and as long as you are kind of reminds me of a story so back in

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.720
the day I was in Boy Scouts and I was trying to get the bicycling merit badge

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:33.660
and in the bicycling merit badge you had to do a bunch of really long bicycle

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:44.450
trips and the last one was a 50-mile trip my dad joined me on that trip and how

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:52.570
he joined me is he followed 10 feet behind me in his car beeping every time I

00:09:52.570 --> 00:10:04.130
slowed down if the hill was to did that help help it it was motivational

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:11.930
it did not inspire me to ever want to do another 50-mile trip as a as a teenager

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:19.410
but I did get to the goal right so there's motivation is a is a careful

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.890
thing yeah you can use it to get to a goal but how do you get it how do you

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:33.030
use it so that the next goal achievement is easier it doesn't scale if

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:38.790
the the virtual father has to follow behind in the car for every person

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.460
taking a bike trip right I could talk about the New York the whole episode and

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.100
we'll we won't we'll only talk about it for half or maybe I'll say five minutes

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:56.900
and then I'll expand to 15 one thing is that up until now and we'll have this

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:02.220
continually we've had these program managers embedded in the teams and I

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.020
have all but one or two of those will actually stay there and help their teams

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.540
but they haven't thought about how to scale that across the org so that's

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:17.060
gonna be it'll be interesting to sort of dotted line manage that group so it's

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.300
kind of it's a little bit like my old org where I will have some there are

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.940
some PM's that will be embedded in the teams they work with which I think is

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:32.150
the right thing for that for sort of a senior level technical glue role but

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.070
I think it will also be good to use that group to begin to figure out what are

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.470
those bumper rails those lightweight processes we need and what are the

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.750
fewest we need to actually be most efficient so I'm looking forward to that

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:49.190
but I will learn more about that as we go one of the PM is reporting to me is

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:55.150
very much in the the data he loves data and analysis and knows all the cool

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.510
Excel tools reminds me of you Brent a little bit and I gave him all of my

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.870
project-level data on delivery rates and he did a bunch of analysis and came

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.430
back with this gradient gradient color-coded chart showing me the projects

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.350
that were more than two standard deviations away from the norm as far as

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:19.750
delivery and I said yep those are our three problem projects so no surprise is

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.510
there but instead of anecdotally observation observation based anecdotes it

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:31.810
was data-based solution so I think while that one was not insightful I'm

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.810
confident that he is going to help find insights in the way we deliver across

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:42.880
the org because we're moving now to a stage where you know up until a week or

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.800
two ago we have 60 60 ish projects in flight across the organization things that

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.800
are actively being worked on that was a little customer value we are rapidly

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.280
getting to a stage we're going to have nearly a hundred different projects in

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.160
flight across the larger organization that can have customer value those things

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:09.560
ranging from two-week experiments to sometimes three-month projects to deliver

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.400
a whole new SDK or functionality to a customer so getting some consistency in

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.100
how we track those things and how we how we improve based on how we deliver

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.220
those things is going to be fun yeah it's gonna be interesting to hear that

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:35.340
that journey right I don't know of any team that has tried to take the journey

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:46.800
to that scope and has done so without heavily leveraging command and control

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:57.550
and in shame of it and that that hopefully is just due to a culture at

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:04.340
the company that is now dead yeah that's the opposite of our culture so I would

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.580
be very surprised if we got there so the I think the bigger worry from our

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:13.780
leadership is that we don't add enough process to keep things under control but

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.460
that we but also that we retain autonomy I'm about to make a decision

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:24.500
one of my few process hammers we have one part of the organization we can make

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.450
it here right now on the podcast what are we making your decision oh no I've

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:35.330
made it oh okay I've actually made the decision it's actually one of the few

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:44.050
times I'm going to imagine a functional team that split across three team leads

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:49.050
so imagine with the team being roughly two pizza size imagine that three of

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:54.050
those teams together actually work on a big part of the project you with me so

00:14:54.050 --> 00:15:00.050
far so imagine three teams of six to eight dead who are all part of a larger

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.290
team a larger okay delivering like say they're delivering they're delivering

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.130
fruit their project is fruit and there's the banana team lead and the

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.210
apple team lead and the orange team lead this is horrible metaphor but that's

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:18.550
they're all part of delivering fruit now imagine that they all use completely

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.230
different project management tools and completely different project management

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:29.890
techniques okay so far not hard to imagine oh well now imagine me coming oh

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:36.180
you know what I know I'm gonna piss all of you off at once in the in the sake

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.940
of a greater good and have you all use the same project management tool so you

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.260
can work better with product so you can't we have a better chance of doing

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.180
what's going on so I can help you more and it's one that none of you are using

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.300
right now so you are gonna feel the pain and I'm gonna help you through the

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:58.150
pain and we just have to do it and they're gonna cry and they're gonna

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.750
complain but we're gonna do it anyway and within a month they're gonna be

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:07.270
happy yeah it's I've it reminds me of a similar strategy I've taken before

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:13.890
right it's essentially instead of having them fight amongst themselves over

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:22.530
who has the greater tool you basically come in you've defined it and now

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:30.210
temporarily they are unified as a singular team on hating Alan in his

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:35.210
dictatorial that's exactly and then right once once they align on hating me

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:41.210
they'll have a better chance of aligning generally going forward I'm happy to be

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.970
the first thing their hatred towards me in this case I'm happy to be if that's

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.610
the first thing they align on great because that means they can align and

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:56.510
they can rally around that a hundred percent on the same page that a hundred

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:03.790
percent the the other thing too I mean I've shared this on a podcast right

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:09.870
there is a there is a phrase I rarely use well I don't know if it's rare I

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:16.230
probably pull it out of my back pocket now once a quarter and and the phrase is

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:23.270
and I think you could imagine all sorts of places to use this but the phrase is

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:28.230
hey guys here's one one place where I want to take an opportunity to remind

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:37.010
everybody that I work really hard to make this team appear to be a democracy

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:46.530
watching Alan Parse I'm gonna pull that one out I like that that that goes from

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:52.050
your back pocket into my back pocket thank you for the love I think it's they

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.650
they stop pause wait a minute he works really hard to make it appear but he's

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:02.570
implying if you can hear you can you can almost hear the gears like oh right

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:10.600
right so every now and again you I find that I have to reassert that ultimately

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:17.080
I'm accountable in the way I've decided to to make decisions is to push decisions

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:28.050
down as much as possible yeah however and and I do try to work hard to such that

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.780
people forget that I have veto power but every now and again I need to pull it out

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.780
because we're in the weeds it's not a sort of reminder of everybody that that

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.340
I'm still the guy in charge I could give a shit about that it's just oh my

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.940
god you are so much in the weeds it's gonna take three months for you guys to

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:54.020
figure out how to get out of the weeds turns out I have a weed whacker we're

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:59.020
going we're going in this direction so it's interesting you brought that up

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.740
with whatever you said a moment ago about them being the decision makers as

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:10.920
I've added 15 people to my org I've met with them all individually by now at

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.640
least once as well as in some team settings and one of the things that I

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.640
continue to iterate because anytime there's a move like this there's some

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.240
thud some fear uncertainty and doubt that comes with it so I reiterate my

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:29.640
style is I and one of the things I've said to everyone is I believe decisions

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:37.780
are best made by the person closest to the work so I am rarely if ever probably

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.220
never going to jump in and make a decision for you I can help you

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:47.500
brainstorm that decision I can help facilitate a discussion around the

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.980
decision those things I'm good at but I'm not gonna make those I was talking

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:56.060
to one of the new DevOps engineers yesterday and just talking you I'm so

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.420
glad you're not a micromanager and I'll work that way it sounds like you're a

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.060
lot like my last manager say great I said and I want you to know just for full

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:09.790
transparency we may have a discussion sometimes it gets into like a solution

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:16.150
or a tool or how something we could do and it is not never going to me telling

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.910
you what to do or telling you what decision to make it is purely me getting

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.310
excited and living vicariously through your work since I don't get to do that

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:37.270
anymore that moment where you've you've gone you're what is it the the seventh

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:42.910
stage of of grief right where you're no longer in denial you're I have acceptance

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:53.750
you're like yep I don't do things anymore but I still have this need okay let me

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.430
try to do vicariously yeah that's all I can do at this point given the the

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:03.390
variety of projects of functions of disciplines I'm managing across the team

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.670
and by the way for the people in the livecast I changed the view from speaker

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.670
view to showing both of us at once so you can see when Brent makes faces when I

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:18.160
talk but if you prefer the other view let me know should we wait the 20

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.400
seconds whatever I'll glance over it chat once in a while there was a really

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.280
good comment someone said oh man I missed the first 15 minutes and then before I

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.560
could type anything in perzy reminded them that nothing good happens in the

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:35.580
first 15 minutes anyway it's it's the Brent and Alan BS show one other thing I

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.180
was going to mention about the new org to see if I can remember one interesting

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:46.370
thing happened is one of my oh actually this is something worth talking about

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:50.810
because this isn't optimal but I think I'll make it work at least for the

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:55.290
medium term in this merge I have gained a DevOps team and I've gained a

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.770
documentation team which means I have two documentation leads with teams and

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:07.730
two DevOps teams with leads and some various other ICs right now I have too

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:13.290
many direct reports I want to flatten that a little bit but I've always been

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:20.200
hesitant of having two you mean unflattened it right you have too many

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.520
direct I want to unflatten it a little bit yes I knew what I meant damn it so

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.590
the challenge for me is I want to get past the their org versus our org stuff

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:36.910
even though right now functionally I have leads from my old org and leads for

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:42.860
the new org coming in so I do have plans and everyone is on board on

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.540
learning to on getting a stage where they can learn from each other and begin

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:53.060
to share work across them but I need to consciously start to blend them into one

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.940
kind of like the Brady Bunch I need to spend time making sure I can blend them

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:03.860
into one team and I don't stay into the X org and the Y org over time so

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.140
that's something I'm working on but probably something I'll come up that

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.300
there's no immediate problem I just always avoided having it's not a great

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.540
way to do a merger in this case I think it makes sense for the short term I have

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.220
to figure out how to it's top of mind on my challenges as far as bringing the org

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.240
together yeah I don't have enough business so it's like the way you've

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.710
described it so far so far right unless there's a sort of a red thread that

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:35.790
ties everyone together team identity is absolutely gonna be critical and is is

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:41.010
the way you've described it's gonna be hard yes and there's another challenge

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:45.610
that I'm gonna crowdsource to the three and to you but to the three indirectly

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:51.130
through you is I didn't worry about having a team identity when I had my

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:56.050
team of eight DevOps or yeah eight DevOps and three doc writers three or

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.900
four doc writers sorry I should know one two three three doc three and a half

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:06.430
doc writers ones on loan and a few other random ICs it's I never worried about

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:13.430
describing what the identity or role of my team was it's very much in the even

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:18.310
with DevOps is very much still been accelerating the achievable quality and

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:22.190
also I have docs because they have a huge impact on the customer perception

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.150
equality and stories there one of the things I want to crowdsource to the team

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.630
especially now since I have you know eight people in Docs and 15 or 16

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:35.950
people in DevOps and and six other ICs working on various quality and PM

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.710
initiatives is what does my team do what should I call my team right now in

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:45.750
Slack it's called Allen team and I don't like that I want to find a name for my

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:51.550
team and the best I've come up with so far which is which is the wrong name but

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.870
I'm hoping by being by it being so wrong that people will come up with better

00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:06.300
answers is org name dash glue yeah yeah I'm actually thinking of

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.260
yeah I don't have I mean I have a name for you it's not a good name

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:19.620
I don't think is gonna fly if you know it we can work through the acronym right

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:25.940
and go if it were over here right the first letter would be Azure so that you

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:32.020
mean yes yes right Azure oh are they oh wait wait wait can I help with this so

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:39.230
can the next version of Windows be Azure operating system for business net Azure

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:45.940
Azure operating system Azure operate as your OS for business is the new name

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.660
for Windows you heard it here first announcement yeah so you forgot power

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.740
right would need to be the power of your operating system for business as your

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:03.740
powered OS for business no power the power of Azure OS for business net got it

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:14.480
anyway yeah it's not it's not a functional name but essentially I'm thinking about

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:21.260
our friends comment so many years ago and have you put yourself into another

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:31.360
position where you run the everything else org have I lost you no no no cuz is

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:38.840
this thing on while true I can actually say that no one sees it that way okay well

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.840
that's good that's good but on you know for better or for worse people still see

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.520
because of title only and the way I run projects and the engineering operating

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.960
system it's Alan's program management org which is not right at all either so my

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.490
org is the majority of our org is DevOps our customer for DevOps and for

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:05.610
all the rest of my org except for documentation is to enable our internal

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:12.250
teams to kick ass and deliver quickly and safely to customers when I add

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:18.210
documentation to the mix and again I fully believe it fits because we've made

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.290
so many improvements in the customer perception of quality by improving and

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.410
adding documentation even in the eight months I've been running that org that

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:32.280
it really fits a lot with quality and there are some people that remember that

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.440
I have an extensive quality background and so they say oh Alan's quality team

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.480
but I really don't really have one of those either but I'm still like what

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.060
do you got what do you got how would we and then so I got one versus the

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.200
remainder yeah the actually yeah the remainder is what I was trying to do I

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:56.140
know but I couldn't page load it the way you just described like first off

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:02.030
I'm like you know what injury engineering operating system you know EOS

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:08.510
sounds would be kind of cool you run the EOS team right because no one's heard of

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:13.030
that before but then it's probably not inclusive enough of everyone in your

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:18.790
organization right if your documentation team is their output is is intended to

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.950
go straight to the customer right not not to both directions we do have some

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:29.950
internal docs they work on as well that helps out marketing sales etc but yeah

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:37.110
largely to the customer but what about the quality operating system right the

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:42.190
problem is is that acronym is QOS yeah that's already taken and the the Q word

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:48.100
what I think they may get it in this org I yeah that would be internal yeah

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.860
the Q word I worry a little bit about about pigeonholing I gotta tell you

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:58.660
yesterday on Twitter I thought it was funny someone mentioned and this is fine

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.380
I wrote this in an article 15 years ago as well but that you shouldn't blame bugs

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.420
on testing literally 15 years ago I go dig out the article where I talked about

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.780
the one that got away article for sticky minds and you know blaming bugs on

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.540
testing is does it work it's a whole team thing someone was commenting about

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.060
that yet again very adamant about it lots of threads on yes tough this is

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:24.060
ridiculous it's hurtful and yeah I totally agree but what it made me think

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:31.090
of wasn't and of course the tangents are here is I actually ask that all the time

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:36.020
now why did why did we miss this in testing but I'm not blaming it I'm not

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:41.500
blaming anyone I'm trying to get to the root cause of why we let a failure get

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:47.060
to production so what I'm digging in with a team on who developed and tested

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:52.500
their own code and I made some comments that said I still say this but you know

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.740
I say it's all the time the difference in context is that my the team I'm talking

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.380
to is a team that developed the code as well as tested it and people which I

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.100
thought was interesting and insightful it talks about how things are changing

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:09.420
and boy did I got busy because of my 45 hours of meetings a week and came back

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:14.420
and people were all up in arms like the author's the author the original

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.820
people like you don't know my context it's like that's great and and it's an

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.060
anti-nice guy I know him and I like him but apparently I triggered the hell out

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.940
of him and then people jumped on the the whole we were getting rid of testers

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.060
thing and I thought oh god I did not mean to trigger this I just wanted to

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.940
talk about this is interesting is this thing that I used to be just as adamant

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.620
about I have a different view on because the way I run engineering

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:47.890
systems now and people just it was a I didn't realize it was a massively

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:52.570
triggering tweet for a lot of people and I apologized to everyone I offended I

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.970
stand behind my words this stuff works for me it doesn't mean it works for you

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.490
because I never said that I'll edit that out but just pisses me off anyway

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:08.290
what were we talking about yeah I'm ignoring you know I'm trying to find it

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:14.770
the Twitter's right the so already proposes I could just be release

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:20.780
management but I think that's there's something to that it is there's

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:27.260
something around how we release I think release management has some other

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:34.340
connotations yeah I don't like the word management in there right it I don't

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:41.780
like that right it's essentially it evokes essentially Alan is the the chief

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.980
bureaucrat in charge well in a way I am it could be release and engineering

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:52.650
operations speed wagon so you could be a real speed wagon I'm just throwing shit

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:57.780
out there yeah you know you get a good idea Brent right you know a lot of ideas

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.460
and throw the bad ones away but a very good idea on a different tangent is the

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:11.980
idea of calling the operating system Azure warp speed or AWS for short because

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.460
that one's a winner what were you talking about after you were going me I

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.980
was making random comments after I was ignoring you I started making random

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.780
comments around release management I mean that was like 30 seconds ago though I

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:31.940
don't think your memory has gotten that bad no it hasn't Bert the base off of

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:38.060
this I mean I like I current I mean it's not entirely inclusive right what you

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.740
could do is just throw together a bunch of ideas get your leaders in a room and

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:49.060
say hey I want something I want like I wouldn't crowdsource this with me in the

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.780
three I would crowdsource this yeah that meetings already on the calendar for

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.380
next week but I want to try and get some of the and again one of my

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.060
techniques for getting ideas out of people is to give them all of the bad

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.260
ideas to start with because then they will try and improve on those and

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.700
actually get somewhere so I'm what I'm looking for from the three is here are

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:12.060
all the things that won't work perzy asked like how is different from SRE or

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:17.020
site reliability engineering and they are on the tail end for us at least and

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:21.780
I think generally SRE are looking at things after they're deployed and I am

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.180
trying to make sure like if I do my job really well SRE's job is easier

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.860
because there's fewer incidents and fewer oddities or operational surprises

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:37.300
coming their way anyway yeah I definitely have a leads meeting next week to go

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:43.820
over this where we'll come to a conclusion and present that to the team

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:50.770
the following week that's my so I put a deadline in place it makes sense anyway

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.970
do you want to that's my org we'll hear more about that in the Alan talks about

00:33:54.970 --> 00:34:00.890
unity section of the podcast which will continue but we also oh we're out of

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.730
time no we got the time go we have a mailbag question which is definitely

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:11.860
worth unpacking and talking about can you wait do you know how to read I do you

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.660
read the question so I could listen to it again because I ignored you last time

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.780
you're at a chimney except for the one part I liked

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:34.740
folks this is from who and who I whose name I presume is not Kristoff had us

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:41.590
right he's got an accent mark over the s I have no clue what that means in any

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:48.350
language let alone his so I apologize for that no that's yeah I think I think

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:54.060
that's legit I'm sure it's legit I just don't know what it means in terms of how

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:59.780
I'm supposed to think it's a change or a something like that anyway Kristoff we

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.670
apologize but we're gonna go over your question yes hey folks I have a question

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.870
about deployments and creating an adaptive culture I hope it's the right

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:15.590
place to ask yes it is it absolutely is having pre-read it we have a mobile app

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:21.590
and are doing loads of experiments we're also a seasonal business so of course it's

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:28.070
essential that we release fast and often currently we do weekly releases

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:34.350
regressions take a day multiple teams contribute to that repo and if we release

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:42.110
a bug our rollback time is also crap due to review time on stores I assume app

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:48.550
stores in that case we have got some automation working on doing less manually

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:53.990
but because of how long it takes to restore the previous version we won't be

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:59.830
able to be more adaptive and move really fast we moved away from agile

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:07.330
testing framework and doing a variation of modern testing it's and seems like not

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:12.330
having continuous deployment is holding us back and keeps us working in a

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:19.230
predictive manner any tips on what to try out so let me try and paraphrase for

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.750
understanding so for clarification it's how do we do the lean things that you

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:30.070
and I preach so much in a mobile app where your release process is limited by

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:35.830
the time it takes to get to submit and get feedback and get approved from the

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:41.780
the app stores for Apple and Android that that inherently that's a bottleneck

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:47.790
how do you work around that bottleneck in the system yeah I think that's a good

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.710
summation I mean there's a couple one thing that I think is an interesting

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:57.430
question is or statement rather is we moved away from the agile testing

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:03.260
framework and doing a variation of modern testing that let's dive into that

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:09.020
first before we go into solution mode so I'd actually like to understand more

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:15.180
what that means because I consider you know the the modern testing principles to

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:21.380
be you know maybe an evolution or maybe an adjunct to agile testing it's you know

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.860
we care more we I guess the only differences are we have a an emphasis on

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.060
data which is not in agile testing is defined by defined by Lisa and Janet

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:38.930
and that may be it we may emphasize coaching and consulting a little bit more

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:44.090
but I don't I don't think that much but it's not that much different so maybe

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:48.970
it's just more lean than agile because you and I talk about lean so much and so

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:53.730
much of our modern testing principles are stolen many more of those are stolen

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.130
from the lean startup than they are from the agile testing book but both are

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:01.480
influences no so one of the things that's interesting and we've talked

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:11.100
about this in the past when we were forming up modern or MTP right the like

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.980
they moved away from the agile testing framework and doing a variation of

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:24.860
modern testing the implication there is Christoph has a a feeling that that

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:33.330
modern testing is a replacement framework right it like implies sort of tactics

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:39.170
and steps and you know a criteria by which you can evaluate whether or not you

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:46.970
are successfully deployed modern testing and I have no doubt that right I do

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:50.890
think modern testing has gotten to the point where it's absolutely bigger than

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:58.290
us and not not controllable by us anymore so I have no doubt that there

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:04.730
may be a belief around hey there's a tactical framework and a progression you

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:09.450
can take you know when I think about it you're right data coaching the other one

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:16.250
though principle seven right principle seven could easily be interpreted as

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:23.140
moving towards unified engineering oh yes there's that one too I forget about

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.340
that because it just happened so naturally for me yeah I would say if

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:36.330
there's anything that's a modern testing framework call is sort of a be

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:43.930
hyper cynical hyper that's cynical critical hyper critical on your need for

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:52.900
test specialists right you probably don't need them the way you think you do that

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:58.100
is to loop back to our previous topic quickly and jump back on this is not

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:03.860
reporting to me but we do have some dedicated QA in my overall new

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.780
organization and I met with the dev lead in charge of that organization and they

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.380
not in so many words asked me if I was going to get rid of their QA team and

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:19.060
that answer is basically what I gave them I said there's no my charter is

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.980
never to get rid of QA my charter is to make sure teams are as efficient as

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:29.260
they can be in delivering quality software to our customers and sometimes

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:36.420
maybe frequently or very often in my past sometimes that means QA move into

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.660
different roles that help optimize and accelerate the achievement of quality

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.860
better so interesting you brought that up because that conversation came up as

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:49.570
well this week in my so so what's the real answer the real answer is probably

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:54.170
god I hope they don't listen to this podcast but they do the real answer is I

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:59.450
expect at some point that team again I have dissolved so many test teams without

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:04.810
laying off a single person I want to be that clear I don't know testers I work

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:09.330
to make sure you find a role where you can be most effective in what you're best

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.370
at so I imagine that will probably happen with those people in the org

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:19.250
they'll move into various DevOps and development and maybe quality consulting

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:24.970
roles yeah that that's I can't imagine that not happening in an org that I'm

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:30.530
in charge of so I know the thing is but you have to disappoint people at a level

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:35.290
they can absorb and I can't it whatever you do a reorg you have to let things

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:40.010
keep going more or less as they're going for a little while and then boil

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.810
the frog in the direction you want to go in but again going back to principle

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:49.090
seven is and we're way off tangent on this on this topic but it isn't that

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:52.370
you get rid of the testers and like this Yahoo article and just taking away

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.610
the safety net it's you may get to a point where you realize you don't need

00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:02.150
dedicated testers anymore and I like to try and help teams get there yeah it was

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:07.950
interesting because so the reason why I asked that question is as you laid it

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:14.550
out I'm like okay let's imagine I'm in Alan shoes and this question came to me

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:21.490
and I realized I don't know that I would have been as smooth as you were in terms

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:28.280
of responding but I knew the answer almost instantly right it like the way

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:35.360
the question was posed the fact that it's a concern says to me there is an

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:41.040
extremely high chance that there is now an in-place safety net that needs to

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:47.910
be worked through yeah but but my role requires a high level of emotional

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:54.380
quotient and leading people on a journey to get where I want them to go agreed

00:42:54.380 --> 00:43:01.740
agreed so back to the question back to the question so tips to try out what

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:11.220
what's what's your tips so what I would do have done would do is one way to get

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.460
around because this this app store turnaround is real especially when when

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:22.300
one or more of the app stores sort of have moving goalposts I shouldn't say

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.820
sort of the goalposts on what it takes to have your app approved and deployed are

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:31.860
moving so sometimes almost the identical app that was approved last week cannot

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:39.940
get approved this week so the way around that of course is to do have

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:45.660
remote configuration and fig fig your flags feature flags in your app so you

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:50.860
can take a bug fix or a new feature that you think is correct and you can even

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:55.060
deploy with the feature flag turned on and the app at startup of course it

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.460
would require again you're stuck if your app doesn't is an offline app and

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.500
doesn't require network access you can't do this but ideally when your app

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.580
starts up it can look at a server see what flags should be turned on or off

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:15.060
and do its thing and then if you need to roll back all you do is flip a flag on the

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:20.140
server that feature is turned off and you can continue you can you know tweak

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.580
it for the next release but you're not breaking anybody in the in the short term

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:30.260
you have I think you have likely far more experience with dealing with app

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:35.820
stores than I do I have a question for you yeah maybe there's a lingo so

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.460
there's two kind of deployment models or update models I see with app stores right

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:49.020
there's the one where an app detects the local version of the app detects that

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:54.020
there's a bit of update in the app store and redirects you to the app store to do

00:44:54.020 --> 00:45:02.220
that update right that process obviously requires you to go through the the app

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:10.280
store gauntlet to get an update rolled out right but then there's the other

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:16.910
model where I see sort of a an app deploys and it's sort of a Chrome around

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:26.540
the app but doing say business logic updates or you know UI changes where the

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:36.140
Chrome is is consistent but the app itself updates from within itself yeah yeah

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.980
I could see that I don't know how I haven't done that before and that's a

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:45.940
great way to do it but it kind of seems the the app store owners want so much

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:50.900
control over their apps like a massive amount of control of what gets approved

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.740
I can't imagine them approving an app that works like that in the first place

00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:00.860
without some wheel greasing somewhere so I actually haven't used that model but

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:06.740
it is another great way you could do this and I'm I've seen a lot of apps I

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:10.860
don't know how they get those approved and what the agreement is with the app

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.620
stores where they can do that but that's a that's a really an ingenious idea and

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.980
I've idea and of course you can download definitely download additional

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:26.460
assets or or some updates outside of the app store so I guess my advice is

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:32.420
look into ways you can work around the app store requirements because what you

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:36.460
want to do in the theory of constraints is identify your biggest bottleneck hey

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.180
our biggest bottleneck is the turnaround time and submitting to the app store and

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:46.020
figure out how we mitigate that that bottleneck and one is feature flags but

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:51.940
there may be a deployment option that's actually approvable where you can do some

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:56.100
classification at least of updates outside of the app store process which

00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:00.580
would be great but you're right as I think about it a lot more apps should

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.380
do this so and for context you know we don't deliver apps we deliver tools with

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:10.420
multiple SDKs people can use to make apps but we have to test that process so

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.580
we test it by submitting apps and seeing what Apple and Android's policies are

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.860
so we can anticipate those for our customers and give them the right advice

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:24.650
and things to do so my experience there is limited from that perspective but I

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:30.850
am familiar with at least at least of course a feature flags but anyway

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.410
there's got to be a couple ways to mitigate that bottleneck that have been

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:38.810
actually tried and proven from an app store perspective look into those like

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:45.370
when I read this and I'm actually reading his responses on the three have

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:50.250
come in this this question came from the select channel and by the way before you

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:53.850
get there the three are awesome because one of the things I look for in a

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:58.250
community is self-sustaining and people ask questions all the time and Brent or

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:04.470
I not only don't need to answer them but rarely if ever is there a case where

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:10.950
the three don't respond better than we could have in the first place so love the

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.820
three thank you for being there all three of you go on absolutely love the

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:22.660
three that is just a strong self-supporting community like if you're not

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.300
on it get on it it is worth your time and then the other thing I wanted to call

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:37.630
out I haven't listened to the latest 343 but Danny fought damn that dude is

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:48.200
awesome yeah I am so jealous that he's working through the the the wine bird

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:54.360
biography like I mean actually writing the book and all that that's probably

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:59.560
not the thing but the fact that he had enough exposure and talking that he's

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:05.280
he's actually capable of doing that like that historical context I'm absolutely

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:10.000
jealous of Danny on that's just fantastic now going back to Chris

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.790
offspring like when I look at this like the very first thing I would want to try

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:23.910
to balance he calls out like they have a problem with rollbacks he has a CICD

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:30.370
right if they don't have CACD because of app store bureaucracy they can still have

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:38.820
CI they can have CI and then deliver to to to some version of a master branch

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:48.060
that's just ready to to roll out the the thing is is the limitation is okay it

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:55.140
rolls out oops we screwed up now he also mentioned it rollbacks are our

00:49:55.340 --> 00:50:02.520
painful and so to me this says okay you need to do something to protect master

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:12.950
branch you need to do something to make it a bit more preventative model but the

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:20.710
inability to just sort of do rollbacks which is why feature flags came to mind

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:24.230
right away you need a way to write if you could just that's the fastest way

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.990
because if there's a problem and simply restarting the app and getting it to

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:36.530
reread from the remote config it's fixed rollback is is that fast right it what I

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:44.490
would I would look at is how can we make architectural changes to support these

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:50.970
capabilities right a config rollback a like what we just talked about a

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:55.770
business logic like in my mind I've already sort of designed if I were

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.730
building an app like this how would I make it such that I could update it

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:02.210
with and a rollback from with it right again we're gonna look at the biggest

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:05.290
pain point which right now is the ability to roll back or handle a

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:10.730
regression in a timely manner for our customers and brainstorm on what are the

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:15.560
ways we can work around these bottlenecks and it's all the things we

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.120
just talked about it's like but it needs the team to brainstorm what's

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:22.400
feasible it could be architectural it could be adding a feature flag which is

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.600
semi architectural and definitely architectural for changing the nature of

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.200
the app where the guts of the app are actually separate from the Chrome that

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.360
goes through the app store but then there may be other options as well I'm

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.440
sure the internet and Stack Overflow and center are full of ideas but the

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:42.360
team needs to really brainstorm on how to work around the bottlenecks that are

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:49.580
out of there especially when they're out of their control yeah that's you

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:55.940
said it correctly I know what I'm doing I don't everyone knows is that on this

00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:04.300
podcast Brent is a smart one but I'm the pretty and entertaining one agreed on

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:08.820
all points all right I hope that that was a good discussion that I hope

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.020
continues and I hope and again probably the three answered that better than you

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.060
and I did but I did want to call out the transition from agile to modern

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.260
testing because that's something we hadn't heard before and worth talking

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.660
about then just a sort of and we're not the right people to help brainstorm the

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:29.100
solution for this but we're the right people to through our wrong answers for

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:33.260
you to realize that brainstorming how to work around those bottlenecks is what

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:39.110
should be done the one last thing I'll call out before we sign off is if if

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:44.270
we were wrong and and actually app store isn't the primary cause of the

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:50.230
bottleneck then then one of the things that I have found is that actually

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:56.050
doing a shift to Kanban is really helpful here right because even though

00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:04.990
you may not have a CD system Kanban's kind of kid gets that muscle going yeah

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:08.310
well Kanban the best thing about Kanban if you use it right it helps you find

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:13.550
where the bottlenecks are on your system it does but I'm thinking in in

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:20.030
terms of the benefit I gained from it right you essentially if you if you

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:25.870
singly release one ticket you don't have the this sort of this the scrub

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:30.190
impact where all of the bugs get introduced to the product at 11 p.m.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:38.970
the night before and if you roll out one small batch chunk and everything's on

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:44.770
the floor right it should be easy to roll that back then to build on that yeah

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:49.890
one thing is that I think because of the bottleneck and deployment the team

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:54.890
could very well likely be encouraged to bundle up a bunch of changes so they only

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:59.400
have to submit it once to the app store so you're really as a mobile developer

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:03.940
you really got to find a way to work around that stuff all right all right we

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.460
got we got meetings to go to man I got a this is Friday's usually my light day

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.740
and it is today I only have six hours of meetings but counting this one this one's

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.780
fun though this one doesn't count yeah this one doesn't exhaust me like the rest

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:19.570
of them do all right hey thanks for you guys turning in as and again and and gals

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:24.370
folks y'all once again I promised next time we do a livecast to advertise it

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:28.130
in our slack group a little bit more ahead of time so that people can plan

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:35.170
around it but thanks for listening yeah I know I know and it's been fun

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:39.520
chatting with you burnt I got the name right see you next time

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.890
bye all right bye bye
