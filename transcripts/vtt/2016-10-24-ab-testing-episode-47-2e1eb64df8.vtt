WEBVTT

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.800
Hey everybody, howdy. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we are here for episode 47.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.440
47 counting down to 50. That should be this year.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.280
I know. So what should we do for our, this is a question for our listeners. What should

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.140
we do for our 50th episode? Meaning? Like anything special?

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.820
Tequila. We could actually bring in the tequila and before you suggest Naked, Brent and I

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.180
are actually naked for this podcast. And most of them prior.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.300
Yeah, most of them. Most of them. Not the one with Steve.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.500
No, no. Speedos for that one. Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.100
There's a problem with recording a podcast at eight o'clock in the morning.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.100
You don't have enough time to get sufficient caffeine.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.220
I know. And I was up late. I was up a little late last night trying to get a couple

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.580
things done. So guess what, Brent? What? I bought myself a new car.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.900
Congratulations. What'd you get? It's a red car. It's got these cool falcon wing

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.780
doors. The back doors kind of open out and up. They're pretty cool. Up and out.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.700
What makes it a falcon wing versus say an I don't know that that's what Tesla

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.860
calls the back doors. You got yourself a Tesla.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.220
I got myself an electric car. Nice. So you already had an electric car.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.580
No, I had a hybrid car. Oh, I still have the hybrid car.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.060
I got rid of the we had an Audi Q7, which I hated. OK. Now there's another

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.780
story. That was your other. There's a story I didn't plan on telling.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.100
So I got a Prius like I can't remember how many years ago, 2006, maybe 10 years

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.860
ago, and I like it. I it was perfect for me.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.940
I had just enough tech to keep me excited. And my wife got this Audi Q7,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.100
treated her Audi wagon and she liked it for a while.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.700
She said, I don't like this car anymore. We're trading.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.060
And like a good husband, I said, OK, yes, ma'am.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.420
So I drove the Q7 for a while. I didn't like it.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.500
Just a little too big for me. I don't like really big cars.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.220
Some people like driving around these big old monster trucks like Brent has or

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.940
these big old Ford exhibitionist.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.420
Alan's Prius could fit in the back of my car.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.380
So I don't really like big cars.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.940
So the thing I love about the Model X is it's a smaller car,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.740
yet it still has third row seating and it feels so much bigger inside.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.540
They really did a really nice job with the cabin.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.060
And then there's all the cool like tech, like this massive like iPad pro sized

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.560
screen, which is totally distracting, which has a web browser,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.760
which you should not use while driving.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.620
No, the it's OK.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.540
The sites I wanted to go to get your mind out of there.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.700
Like our VSTS site and our product site won't load on the browser.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.100
So I haven't figured out how to hack in there and send some different user

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.770
agent strings, but I'll get into that.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.530
Is it already ready for the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.120
the self driving?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.440
Yeah, I have it. I have I have auto drive.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
I haven't used it yet. I'm too afraid.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.720
And you're really only supposed to use it on the highway.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.240
And I haven't really driven it much on the highway.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.560
I just I just kind of drive to work and back with it.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.460
But we're taking a road trip this winter, which you really want to use

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.060
the the auto drive, whatever it's called.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.340
That's not called auto drive.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.500
It's called something else.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.980
Anyway, I'm just thinking on snowy and icy roads driving in the winter.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.700
That's the best time to use it, right?

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.620
Absolutely. Lying.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.820
Absolutely.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.620
We better get in 50 before the end of the year.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.620
Otherwise this can happen.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.900
So I'm really enjoying it.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.580
It's of course, it has that that massive Tesla acceleration, but it's fun to drive.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.660
The kids like it.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.860
My daughter, who's 10, said, Dad, can I have this car?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.700
I said, yes, I'm going to give it to you when you're 30.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.540
I

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.110
that's nice of your daughter already thinking six years ahead.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.610
Yeah. Anyway, yeah.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.650
Tesla is something that I will never, ever, ever own.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.010
Because you like your internal combustion engine.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.010
Do you want to burn some gas, some fossil fuels?

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.610
Someone needs to know for me in particular, it's it's the price tag.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.220
So I go, hmm, I could get that

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.220
or I could retire a year earlier.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.340
Yep. And I was thinking, I was thinking we could not get that

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.680
or I can work one more year.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.040
So exact same train of thought.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.680
It's like any time you make a big purchase, I kind of go, well,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.560
I'll probably have to work till I'm a little older anyway, so it's fine.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.020
I'll get bored if I don't work.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.980
Yeah. You got your you still got college to worry about.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.460
Have you got that handled?

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.620
I we are saving frantically for college.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.820
We got the college savings plan going.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.540
Unless my wife is on the we're on the total financial track here.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.500
My wife is of the mind of wherever our kids want to go to school,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.980
we will pay for it.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.060
And I'm thinking, so well, it's too financially.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.900
My money picture is going, no, if they want to go to an Ivy League school,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.530
they better get at least a partial scholarship.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.330
And then if you read which Malcolm Gladwell book is that I think it outliers.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.090
When tells the stories of these kids, like these super straight

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.050
day students go to the and these are awesome students get scholarships,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.130
go to these fantastic colleges.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.500
And then they because they've been used to being in the top of the class

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.420
their whole life, but they're with a hundred other students

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.060
have been in the top of the class their whole life.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.700
They end up being in the bottom half of the class.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.620
They get disillusioned and drop out.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.740
The best way to succeed and get so much this

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.500
involves in the Daniel Pink's work around motivation is you want to go

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.940
to the best school where you can be in the top part of the class.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.610
You want to go.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.340
Actually, this is for everybody.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.700
You want to put yourself in an environment where you are

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.760
constantly what's known as the flow,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.880
where the challenge level is just out of your reach.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.200
And then as you improve your skill

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.120
that brings that challenge back into what you're capable of,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.400
that there's a new challenge.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.080
If you go just way outside, it is absolutely demoralizing.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.120
I've seen this happen to so many people.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.200
And you don't want to be the very top either,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.680
but you don't want to be the very bottom.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.840
There's there's psychological things that affect both parts of that.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.200
Yeah. But also this ties into the Heffetz work,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.720
which talks about something similar to I can't pronounce the guys

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.080
that wrote the flow wrote flow.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.680
I can't either. But somebody will start with a C.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.600
Yeah. Shmoop. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.360
As far as I'm going to go.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.240
But he talks about like I'll try to draw with my hands, but I can't help it.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.840
But if you are complacent, your productivity and your growth is

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.560
minimal to nil.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.320
If you are in completely over your head and overwhelmed.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.880
Same thing.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.080
So there's a simmering point where you're challenged

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.280
just enough to be uncomfortable.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.600
And that's where productivity and growth come from uncomfortable,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.440
but still have a sense of you need to be a little.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.280
If I work a little harder, I can get there is a simmering point.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.640
And this is true both for like in university.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.240
We're talking about as well as on the job.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.520
You want to keep your employees at that simmering point.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.080
You don't want them to be complacent.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.880
You don't want them to be overwhelmed.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.560
But there's a point in between need to find for everyone

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.200
where you get the maximum productivity and growth. Yep.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.660
Well, that actually evolved into a better conversation.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.740
It did. So anyway, all from Tesla.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.300
Saving lots of money for college.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.460
It's all about the we have the nice car now.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.940
It should last for a while.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.540
We're actually on the waiting list for the Model 3, which is the cheaper version.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.060
She was like like thirty thousand dollars.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.300
Probably. But then if you want tires, it's 60.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.760
That's a. So we're in a mark.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.680
So my wife's minivan is now over 100000.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.440
I haven't had a car reach 100000 miles in a long time.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.640
Well, our priest has like one hundred and forty right now.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.320
But she's she's complacent and I'm just waiting for that one big ticket item

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.760
where I'm like, OK, that's it. Done. Done.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.310
Yeah, I don't know if electric cars going to be her thing, though.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.230
All right. Anyway, I dig it. It's fun.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.310
It's got the manly acceleration.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.030
It's got all the tech and stuff.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.110
So it's fun car drive. Cool. Cool.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.150
Shall we get on with the show? Yeah.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.980
Let's let's do it.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.900
Oh, never mind.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.860
Not getting on, not getting on with the show.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.700
One big thing for me, which is odd,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:00.890
is I now have an adult aged offspring and man.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.130
Did they just contact you from like? No, no, no.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.050
My oldest turned 18 just last week.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.820
Wow. I can't imagine.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.780
That transition is just odd.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.060
Like one one thing. Hot mail makes sense, right?

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.460
But hot mail exactly at midnight,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.540
sent him a message saying he's been kicked out of the family,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.060
which, by the way, is a weird message.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.900
But I understand why it was saying that.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.380
They were saying the hot mail family feature he was kicked out

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.490
because now that he's 18, Dad's Dad's rules

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.730
don't matter as far as hot mail is concerned.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.090
Oh, he can sign up for his own mailing list.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.490
Yep. All right. Whatever.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.230
And who uses hot mail anymore?

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.390
Besides your family. What do you use?

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.670
Are you Gmail? I have my own domain.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.390
Oh, right. So now I've been telling my kids, like, look,

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.390
until you're 18, you're off of Gmail

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.630
because I know what that company does.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.230
I'm not going to be morally responsible for you.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.470
Screw it up.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.870
So I'm six years away from having an 18 year old,

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.790
but counting down the days because that's when the second one turns 18

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.670
and it changed the locks and they're done.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.110
Yeah. Changed the locks.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.830
Start charging storage fees. Absolutely.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.630
I tell the kids that I think I'm joking.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.830
Six, seven more years. I told my parents this

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.600
a couple of weeks ago.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.600
I said, yeah, if if Alex is still at home

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.140
and not going to school a year from now,

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.090
if he's at home and going to school, say, if he goes to UW,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.470
then then that's a different thing.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.510
But if he's at home and not going to school,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.190
yeah, I'm charging him rent.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.200
Yeah, my parents gave me a bill when I turned 18.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.370
Did they? Seriously?

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.970
A joke one. But yeah, my dad said I figured out what it cost.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.850
Here's what you owe us. Yeah.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.890
All right. Let's get back to the podcast.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.090
Oh, really? You think it's time? Yeah.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.570
Hey, everybody, it's Al.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.410
And Brett, episode 47, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:32.050
So we spent the last three episodes talking a lot about data.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.530
A ton. A ton.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.450
So let's talk about something else.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.770
Let's let's turn this conversation back on me

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.970
because that's what's really important here, right?

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.010
Yes, it's all about.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.450
I mean, you are the A. I am the A in A.B.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.090
testing. So I want to talk a little bit about what's going on

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.490
with me and my team at Microsoft.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.530
We are getting ready to be known at some point around the world.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.130
In fact, maybe by the time of our next podcast,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.450
I have to look at the calendar.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.940
I can actually speak of our name.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.980
OK. So but in the meantime, that means we're getting ready.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.780
I thought it was Microsoft Juicy for Business.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.860
It is Juicy Microsoft Juicy for Business Enterprise Edition.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.420
It's been a fun transition.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.820
This is actually a lot of things I've wanted to do on the team for a long time.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.820
Now that we're about to, quote, ship

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.040
and become much easier in some ways difficult than this, but much, much easier.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.600
So I want to go through those and talk about those a little bit

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.640
and then also talk about what it means to air quote ship

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.600
in a world where you're shipping a service or an app.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.500
Maybe I'll tackle that first, because there's been a cultural

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.660
maybe mind shift sort of thing.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.100
And maybe you've gone through this, Brent, where

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.100
we have a bunch of people on the team.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.220
The team is a large part of the team has grown up, grown up,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.540
but, you know, live their business life, shipping, shrink, rack products.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.020
We're well beyond the days of going down to Egghead to buy something.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.130
Some of the kids, some of the older listeners may remember Egghead Software,

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.850
but it's really easy for people to think of shipping as this.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.090
Think of Office app.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:19.270
It ships and then you have to taper down like the bugs we take

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.110
and have stabilization, then you get to the ship date and it ships.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.470
And then you wait and see what happens.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.830
Right. Very, very old school.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.750
I think verbally they get that we're going to ship.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.670
We're going to announce.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.190
We're going to ship.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.150
We're going to announce a couple of days later and then a couple of days

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.700
later, we're going to ship again.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.700
Let me ask you a question.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.560
Yeah. Ask a question. The you said that your developer team,

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.740
most of their experience with ship rack products.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.420
And as you were saying that I was thinking through

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.060
the last time I was on a product like that

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.620
and oh and or the last time I purchased a product like that.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.140
And don't even think of it as so.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.060
Ancient. But it's a it's a cultural transformation where it's not just

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.340
developers, it's everybody.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.620
Dev PM management.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.940
They have this and they know logically that we ship

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.540
and we ship like eight times a week now across because we have a bunch

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.380
of microservices as well as a web front end.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.540
So we're shipping like eight times a week across these things to 10.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.660
So we're shipping all the time and that's not going to stop.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.630
So what's interesting is the transition of I mean, they get it like we're

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.670
going to ship and then we're going to ship again later.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.110
But they haven't internalized it yet.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.870
They don't really get the muscle memories not there.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.230
Their muscle memory is still from the old days.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.830
So there's been a couple of things that have been interesting

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.950
and I should have written them down so I get them in some sort of sensible order.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.350
Or if I was a really good podcast editor, I'd splice them into the right order.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.830
But none of that's going to happen.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.830
So I'm going to speak randomly about some of the things that I'm doing,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.910
which I feel like are getting us in the right direction.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.830
And then Brent will tell me how I'm completely wrong.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.630
And then we'll discuss and then move on to the next one.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.510
Okay.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.270
That's the plan.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.790
So one mindset shift in shipping a product is,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.430
Brent, you've been around the block.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.510
You remember shipping your products.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.870
Yep.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:23.540
And one of the things is, is you talk about raising the bar of bugs that you'll take.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.180
Don't laugh.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:25.940
Let me finish.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.140
Yep.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.820
Let me finish.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.620
There's this mindset of, well, that bugs too, that bugs too minor for the risk.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.220
We're not going to take that fix.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.540
It's too risky.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.940
So we got to cut down.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.780
We can't take, we can't, you got to cut down what bugs were taking.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.940
We're taking fewer and fewer bugs.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.860
We got to, where does convergence come?

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:52.360
So my line there after a brief amount of thought is we're going to raise a bar.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.480
But the bar we raise, I mean, we're going to, cause we're going to be

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.720
shipping all the time, if we were to raise that bar so high before our quote,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.920
ship date, our announced date, uh, what would happen after that?

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.520
This flurry of getting out of bars up, you have to lower it at some point

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.720
to let everything else in.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.240
I don't want that flurry of crap coming in all at once.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.190
I'll get back to the flurry of crap later.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.970
So the bar of what we take doesn't change.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.250
We take everything.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.590
The bar, I'll get back to that in a minute, what that checklist is, but the

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:32.190
bar that changes is the bar of what you have to do before that code is checked in.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:37.470
And this has given me a lever to pull that hasn't, uh, I haven't made

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.310
traction on until now before to check in.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.790
As long as your manager signed off, you're good.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.550
Check it in.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.550
Woo hoo.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.390
And we had in the Kia and we had instability.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.510
Um, oh, shocker instability in our branch and some didn't work.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.990
What?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.630
Some developers, of course, better than others at getting the right, doing the

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.230
right due diligence before, but some people would then get in some bad code

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.750
and screwed up for everyone else.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:09.020
So now that I'm re I can raise the bar of what goes in, what has to happen

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.140
before code is checked in.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.860
So you may remember, uh, a thing at Microsoft called ask mode.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.060
Yes.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.460
Well, you have to ask to check things in.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:25.140
And so I got a question from, this is give people what they want versus what

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.740
they need versus what they want.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.060
Yep.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:32.990
So I had our GPM and our VP come to me and say, when are we going into ask mode?

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.870
We need to go into ask mode and lock things down.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:37.940
I thought, huh?

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.470
Yeah, I guess we should go.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.310
Uh, thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.510
I have a plan picture, the light bulb over my head.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.190
Ding.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.440
So we're in, uh, ask mode now.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.160
Yeah.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:50.960
Immediately.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.180
So, but we're going to ask mode, which ask mode means that, uh, one of the

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.540
PM's not the GPM, one of the PM's that he trusts and I sit together twice a day.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.300
And we reviewed, we review things people want to check in and we either

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.500
accept them or reject them.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.580
And I get to be in charge of determining what goes into the product.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.540
And also through this reject things saying, no, you can't check this

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.860
in without writing tests for it or no, please test this across all

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.220
browsers before it goes in.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.140
So all the things they should have been doing before, if they're not

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.500
doing, I can just reject them.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.700
You are now the PO for the product.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.380
And you're doing this, what's done is the acceptance review.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.140
I'm the release engineer, acceptance review, or in the agile world, the PO.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.700
Product owner.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:34.980
Yeah.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.340
Yeah.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.420
So this is working.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.780
So what I'm like, and I can do through that is continue to raise that

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.260
bar of what goes in and then stuff goes in better.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.900
And then something I stole from, uh, Chuck Rossi, his release engineer at Facebook.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.900
He has this idea of plenty of writing on the internet about this, about

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.020
developer karma, and I know that on my devs listen to the podcast so I can

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.140
talk about this is we took 300 changes last week.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.140
Congrats.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.380
Um, which is fine.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.780
I'm happy taking 300, 500, a thousand.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.580
It'll get less as the bar goes up.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.780
They'll have to do more work.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.460
The, that number will drop down.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.540
They also get, keep in mind, most of these are bug fixes.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.060
So I doubt, I think 300 will be our peak.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:22.740
Usually it'll be much far, far fewer, but there were one, two, three,

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.460
four changes that we took out of those 300 that caused a product regression.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.760
Cause they didn't do the proper testing and I signed off anyway.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.560
I didn't recognize it.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.240
Okay.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.080
So Chuck Rossi does this thing called developer karma where in his case,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.080
it's a four star system.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.800
Everybody starts with four stars and you lose half a star.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.240
If you screw something up like that.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:42.920
Okay.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.800
So I'm going to, I will give the exact numbers, but I'm going to use a 10

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.040
point scale and people are going to start somewhere in the upper middle

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.360
half of that and they'll lose or occasionally gain points that they're

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.840
super awesome, like, like imagine, like I, I made this small change, but I

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.440
noticed the unit tests were all screwed up.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.240
So I wrote another 50 to cover any further aggressions in this entire file.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.600
I might give them a point of developer karma.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.520
And then when things get really risky, I want to look at the change,

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.880
the risk of the change match that with your developer karma and go, no,

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.880
you're going to need to do more here or I can trust you.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.760
Yes, this is fine.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.220
Brent's rolling his eyes a little bit.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:28.580
Well, so I like, I like the, I definitely like the gamification aspect of, of this.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:37.380
I'm curious around the, the finger pointy or the rest of the risks aspect.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.220
So one of the things, and that's a good point and two things to keep in mind.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.500
One is I haven't done anything with this list yet.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.500
And two is this won't be a list I ever share.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.580
And I won't say, no, you can't check this in because your karma is too low,

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:57.300
but it will give me, as I'm looking in the PO role, looking at these changes coming

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.340
in, I might go, well, Fred has had a history of, of regressions.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.900
This is high risk and I don't feel like I've had the right people code review

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.180
this. Let me push this back and get a little bit more information.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.020
I'm going to make his bar a little higher and hopefully make him a little bit

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.340
through that, teach him a little bit more careful about his check-ins.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:15.860
Yep.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.420
So, but I'm never going to share that list and stack rank them.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.380
Uh, ever.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.420
Uh, I may bring the knowledge of those, not the list, but the knowledge of what

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.580
I've learned to a people review.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.140
Gotcha.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.750
I think that's a given, but, but overall I want to teach the, uh, devs at the bar,

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:37.140
they have to the developers, the bar, they have to meet to check in code.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.060
It's going to go way up over time.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.570
So once we become announced, I want to do two things.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.790
Uh, and I'm all over the board here, but it will make sense.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.830
One is that bar will be high enough.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:53.470
Like everything that goes in is well-tested and, or behind a feature flag.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.440
And for people not familiar with feature flag, that means that this feature

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.840
is fully checked in, but there's no way for you to use it.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.600
Developers and dog food users can turn it on.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.640
And we have a flooding system where you can turn those things on for

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.080
a select set of users.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.440
You can gather data about how that's working with a select set of users

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.900
and get that information and Brent staring at his phone.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:16.870
Just turning off random.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:17.430
All right.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.430
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:24.110
Anyway, uh, things behind feature flags, uh, should go in and it should

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.110
not affect the rest of the product.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.790
And so I forgot where I was.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:33.100
No, the nice thing with feature flags as well is that if, if, um, you, do you

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:39.790
release it and an undiscovered regression down that code path, it's relatively

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.590
easy to say, okay, turn this off.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.150
Yeah.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.550
Right.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:48.160
The, um, the thing I like about what you just described, and actually

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:55.270
when I am, when I'm in the role of a, of a PO, a biggest, the biggest,

00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:02.820
um, principle I get across is essentially, look, you guys can check in.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.840
Whatever you want, but the main build must always be RTM.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:10.860
Right.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.980
We, you can check in whatever you want, but we have to be able to ship it at

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.740
any time you guys don't get to control the ship date.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.540
Like my favorite teams is where I get engineering out of the business

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.380
of influence, the ship, the ship day.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.660
That should be a business team only decision.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:34.020
But the only way to do that is to make sure that that mean build, that

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.180
mean tree is always ship a bull.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.590
So let me tell you another story about what we're doing and what's changing.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.950
Yep.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:48.060
So right now we are the canonical example of mini waterfall.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.500
So let me, let me describe what I mean by that.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.140
So we have our services are pretty good, but our front end is the most

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.580
error prone part of our product.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.700
Uh, user facing more, at least more noticeable, more visible problems

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.180
and also the largest.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:12.380
So what we do now we've done up to this point is once a week we take our

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.380
develop branch, which is where all this churn was going on uncontrolled.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.160
And we take a snapshot of it to a pre-production branch and we test it

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.120
and dog food it there for half a week, a week or so.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.640
And then release that rinse, lather repeat.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:33.440
What I wanted to do originally when I described this, I just wanted to go

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.640
just get, I don't like that pre-production branch.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.480
I wanted our develop branch to be high enough quality.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.560
We could just take it to production.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.040
Uh, and have it be less of a moving target.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.080
That scared the crap out of people said, no, we need our pre-production branch.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.960
We have to, where do, where do we bake things?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:58.180
So, uh, the compromise I made is that this whole continuous deployment

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.180
thing is such a long haul to, to get people to ship it is, but I feel like now

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.740
I'm on the path there because I wanted to jump like skip a step, but mentally

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.300
and psychologically they weren't ready to lose the safety net of pre-production.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.620
So, uh, I backed off a little bit and said, okay, we're going to keep doing.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.300
So no, actually I put it this way.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.460
I said, never, never mind.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.560
I miss print on my part.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.040
Of course we'll continue to have a pre-production branch.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.160
We will continue to snap that and test that.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.160
Uh, but the quality of our developer and should increase over time.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.040
Well, over time doing what we're doing.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.360
And what I expect to happen is, is I will do that.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:41.280
We will take a snap, but turns, but already seeing advances there and one

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.320
week of this, but I imagine another few weeks to a month at the most and

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.880
our develop branch will be of better quality than our pre-production

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.000
branch ever was.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.120
And once we get to the point where develop is that good, I might just say,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.840
Oh, you know what?

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.560
Gosh, this is actually good enough to ship.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.400
Let's go ahead and, and also because we have rings of deployment, let's go

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.440
ahead and take what's in develop and we're just going to ship that to, uh,

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.280
our first ring of deployment and see how things go.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.120
And we'll look at data.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.240
We'll look at bug reports and then we'll, and we'll just roll things out

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.760
through rings and see how things go and roll back as we need to.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.430
So that, so that will happen.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.830
I think you'll still have the, the, the safety net discussion then.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.070
I think the safety net is what we call a ring zero.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.480
Yeah.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.000
No, no, I completely agree.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.960
Of course you know that, um, this isn't a technical problem anymore.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.600
This is, no, no, no, no, there are technical problems getting the rings,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.560
right, and getting deployment.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.440
And there is one technical part of the problem, but then get to next, but

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.280
you're right, it's getting people used to the mindset of that or shipping

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.340
and things like the bar we're moving is what has to be done before it goes

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.700
in, that's part of it, the bar that, uh, we don't need that safety net.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.960
If we're using rings of deployment, which are also new as some of these

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.200
people have worked on web products before, but they haven't, for some reason,

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.720
they didn't do rings of deployment.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.120
They flipped a switch and it went to the world.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.880
There aren't, there aren't many teams that I'm aware of it at Microsoft,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.560
even today that are doing deployment rings.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.480
So it is my responsibility.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.240
And there are testers in the world that say testers go out of

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.440
the QA business, you shouldn't be making the business decisions on when to ship,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.660
but I make the business decision on when to ship.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.540
It's my, it's my call from a quality perspective.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.120
And so I make that call.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.940
Uh, I am scared to death.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.180
Now, when we are shipping to a hundred people, 500 people,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.280
a thousand people flip the switch.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:35.980
I'm okay.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.680
Right now we have 10,000 daily active users and without rings of deployment,

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.760
you want me to flip that switch and we're going to, we should be at

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.480
a hundred thousand and probably up over a million in the next few months.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.280
And do I want to flip that switch for all of them at once?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.080
My blood pressure goes up just thinking about it.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:55.640
Yeah.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.400
No, you, you will, you will definitely need that to mitigate risk for sure.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:07.640
I was thinking through your other problem and I think the way I might

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.770
try to approach that would be to, uh, Hey guys,

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.090
here's my numbers on the dev branch.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.610
Here's my numbers on the pre prod branch.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.230
Um, here's the number.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.470
Does it go dev pre prod then prod?

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.750
Yep.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:26.270
Okay.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:32.770
So here's the, the regressions that have this have been escaped.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.550
In other words, found in production.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:42.830
Um, here's the cost of the, of the pre prod and try to weave a

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:50.870
story that says pre prod is or try to leave weave the analytics such

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:56.070
that any brain dead monkey looking at this would say there is no ROI for pre

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:01.060
prod, but then present it to your dev team and just simply say, all right,

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.530
guys, here's a bunch of numbers.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.930
We're doing really effectively on this.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:13.840
Now what do what changes do we do to ship faster and try to, try to set

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.040
the stage so that your, your dev managers are the ones that go, we

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.360
don't need pre prod anymore.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:21.620
Yeah.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:22.810
Right.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.130
It'll be fun to get there.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:30.800
I I'm excited about, cause there's a few people that one by one, they kind of get

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.280
it and there's an excitement that comes like, Oh, I call a cow.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.360
I've had people come to me.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.040
This is the biggest compliment I've ever gotten at Microsoft.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.800
I had one of our Ems come to me and says, I feel like we're

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.400
shipping like 21st century software, which is rare at Microsoft.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.120
Yeah.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.680
Now, when I first experienced, um, continuous deployment, particularly in

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.400
the Kanban model, like where, where each of my guys could be shipping.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.680
If you have a large enough team, at least one of your guys is, is

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.840
quote unquote shipping something every day.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:03.640
Right.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:14.280
Um, when I realized how much risk was mitigated by being able to ship

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.320
small things that continuously integrate.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.800
I would rather ship 20 times a day than once a week.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.440
Yes.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.520
Absolutely.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.070
Uh, I remember that moment like yesterday.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.460
I'm like, this is what this does.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:30.660
Yeah.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.660
And there's, it's funny.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.940
There's one developer on the team, one, a manager, one of my peer

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.660
managers who has been, yeah, I want to get to CD.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.780
I want to get to CD.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.060
And then I gave him my original plan.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:46.070
Uh, and he goes, uh, this is a little scary.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.350
The team isn't going to buy onto this.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.590
So even he was a little hesitant and he was right.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.910
This is a, uh, definitely a case where boiled frog seems to be done.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.270
But I have a, I feel like I have a good plan in place.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:56.750
It's coming along.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.190
Couple of other things I wanted to talk about.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:58.670
Okay.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:02.070
One is our developers write two different kinds of tests.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.030
We have, um, some unit tests.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.030
Which, uh, running against a headless browser currently Phantom JS, but,

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.550
um, I think we're going to switch to headless Chrome here shortly.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:14.750
Once it's officially available, those tests are great because they, they

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.630
run super fast and they can, they find a lot of functional regressions,

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.550
even in the web front end.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:24.760
But knowing that we can't find many issues through those unit tests, we

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.480
also write some almost UI tests.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.400
You know, my, you know, my, uh, opinion on UI tests, but there's

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.520
so many, there's selenium tests, which I know many people who've had very

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.760
good success writing non flaky selenium tests, ours are not non flaky.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.960
There are, but they're not super flaky.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.600
They're slightly flaky selenium tests.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.410
And that's what we have pretty much right now for testing behavioral

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.690
and functional correctness.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.250
So there's a couple, some EMs come to me and say, okay, after we ship again,

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.650
after the ship bait, we want to double down on writing a lot more scenario

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.920
tests and my answer to them.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.890
So my strategy here is sort of three pronged or one prong with three curves.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.330
I don't know.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:13.120
But at that level, you, I tested, you know, you saw my blog posts on not

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.120
you didn't, but you did.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.880
Uh, you, the listeners eat it on gooey schmooly.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.200
I really leery of UI tests.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.880
And again, selenium tests work sort of at the object models.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.000
They're a little bit more reliable, but they're very difficult to get correct,

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.240
but not impossible.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.760
So I would rather, uh, and I have one of the people on my team working

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:38.570
on making sure that the scenario tests we have are just rock solid, not flaky.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.170
And also teaching the dev team how to write those tests.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:42.890
Certainly possible that's going to happen.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.210
But I think as far as writing those scenario level tests, that's the

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:47.810
third thing I want to do.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.490
So the bottom thing I want to do is yeah, sure.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:50.490
We need more of these.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.210
We call them scenario tests, these selenium tests, these end to end tests.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:53.650
Sure.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.130
We need a few more of those covers, some gaps, and they need to be rock solid.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.450
That's the third level.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.090
But I wouldn't second level.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.250
I wouldn't double down on that is bottom.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.010
That is number three and the stack rank number two.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:11.170
Moving up is because I believe in that tight dev, what we'll call

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.450
the inner loop at Microsoft.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:17.290
I want more unit tests, uh, great safety net against regression.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.850
Uh, you just sure you can't find everything there, but we'd need a lot

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:26.690
more of those only mainly because they run super fast and they're.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.570
Generally super reliable.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:33.130
We've in fact, I can't think of a case in the last year where we've had a unit

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:39.880
test fail that wasn't due to, uh, uh, faulty code, like the tests aren't flaky.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.800
So, so I want to, if we're going to double down, it's there, but I don't

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.720
want to double down there either.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.840
What I want to do, this goes back to what we're talking about three episodes ago.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.080
I said, no, I want you guys.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.360
We have a lot of, now we have a lot of BI telemetry in the product.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.960
We can tell what users are doing.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.800
So what I want you to do now is use telemetry to tell me whether

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.280
things are passing or failing.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.560
And then we're going to write selenium tests that don't, this is taken

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.000
strictly from Brent that don't try and be the Oracle, which is very,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.320
very hard to do just exercise the product and use the telemetry to figure

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.440
out whether things pass or failed.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:14.720
Yes.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.840
And when we get some of that in place, now I have even more confidence to

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.920
roll through rings and look for failures.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:21.960
So they get there.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.680
They're on board with that suite.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.840
So that's going to happen.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.480
It will happen very slowly, but I'm pushing down like this emphasis

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.000
on these end to end tests.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.720
I think putting more emphasis on the right, like diagnostic telemetry,

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.160
and then the unit tests for that inner loop.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.800
And this is our test for some, for some frosting on top.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.320
Let me give you a, uh, a potential rallying cry.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.160
We we've, we've talked about rallying cries.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.320
We've talked about this in the past.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.400
Oh God, take a shot.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:53.800
Damn it.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:06.720
Um, um, rallying cries are critical to, to, or not critical, but extremely

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:14.400
helpful in solving these in these, um, non-technical, but appear to be technical,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.800
but are actually people problem problems.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.960
Weinberg comes back again.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.120
It's always a people problem.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.520
Yes.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.960
Here's what I would suggest to you, right?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.960
We have these deployment rings.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.680
We have these feature on off switches.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:47.160
I would suggest that what you want, say in six months time is a system that automatically

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:54.160
turns offer on features based off the telemetry being reported.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.360
I like that.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.880
We'll get to that, but yeah, automatic stuff.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.440
So right now, another part of this change is I make the column with it a ship.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:01.760
Yep.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.200
But when I make that call, I go to our SRE, our system reliability engineering team, I

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.000
say, okay, go ahead and flip the switch.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:15.160
And they, they actually do the deployment of the deployment and watch for their

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.760
monitoring dashboards and figure out when to roll back.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.320
Yeah.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.880
They actually do the deployment and watching a monitoring.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.320
So they're my automation right now.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.200
They are.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.680
But what I'm saying is if you use that as a rallying cry and say auto on off,

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:36.430
then, um, so what, what you're at right now is where the DevOps, where the DevOps

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:43.270
will progress next is, uh, if you let it go this way, six, nine months from now,

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.750
that team's going to be flooded by a crappy TSG docs.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.350
They already are.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.870
And I don't remember what TSG stand.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.750
Troubleshooting guide.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.190
Right.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.950
For our three listeners.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.310
Um, so they're going to be flooded by that.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:09.080
And, uh, you run the risk of your developers, um, focused on now bugs and

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:16.620
features, viewing, uh, instrumentation as a second class citizen and, and

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.300
basically saying, Hey, I wrote that TSG jock.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.140
It's now DevOps problem.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.990
I did this whole idea of it's not my job.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.910
Um, unfortunately never dies.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:40.610
Um, but if you can begin the path of saying, Hey, we need to have this telemetry.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:47.450
You guys need to be accountable for making sure the telemetry is such that

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:54.610
it is being used to correctly turn off or on features as it goes through

00:37:54.610 --> 00:38:00.650
these deployment rings, then these DevOps guys are just looking for this new,

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.090
what just got turned on or off signal.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.120
Yeah.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.280
Definitely want to get there.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.280
Great rallying cry.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.480
And we have actually a good set of, uh, behags on my team about

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.600
getting some of these things done.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.280
Behags.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.200
The behags are the big hairy audacious goals.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.640
What book is that from?

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:21.060
That's from, uh, God, uh, I forget which book it's from a book.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.780
I read like 10 years ago.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.220
Okay.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:24.420
Sounds cool.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.820
Anyway, definitely want to get there, but it's fun because a lot of these things

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.860
I've wanted to do for a long time, but the, the circle back to the beginning of

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.540
this conversation is the process of becoming a public app and quote, shipping,

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.700
whatever that means, uh, has allowed me to finally get over the edge on

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.700
many of these things.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:48.020
It's like now people see the reason or I have a way to roll these things out.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.100
One last thing to talk about is, uh, a lot of this from some from a doc.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.460
I wrote on our branching strategy.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.220
People asked me in the traditional Microsoft world, what you do is you

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.660
would create getting close to shipping.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:07.200
You create a release branch and then everybody would party on the old branch

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.400
and then you try and merge them back together after your release.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.640
Hatred.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.800
What that would mean in a product like this is we would quote ship and

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.440
we would never ship again or not for months.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.920
We'll try to get everything to merge back correctly.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.360
Right.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.000
So again, I said right off the bat, we ship out of develop.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.970
And so what do we do with our, what about the, our stuff?

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.610
That's not going into our V one launch.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.450
I said, well, if it's behind a flag, check it in.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.650
If we really don't want it till later, uh, maybe it's a, for whatever

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.290
reason, uh, do it in your branch.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.110
They go, well, how do I merge it?

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:52.750
I teach them how to use get, so what I sat is another interesting thing here.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.670
I've, I've, you know, I've worked in windows-ish products for a lot of my

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.950
career, so I'm, and I'm sort of a command line guy.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.950
My first automation ever was lots and lots of batch files.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.910
I've had to give multiple tutorials on the team on how to use the get command

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.870
line because they use like visual studio.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:14.550
And my role with get is never trust the GUI tools.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:15.950
Just use the command line.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:21.190
There is a couple of good tools on top of get that are fantastic.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.950
I don't trust.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.990
Yeah.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:29.110
The command line, at least on get, so I'm usually a GUI guy, but when it comes,

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:37.200
when it comes to source control management, um, I'm definitely a command

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:44.240
line guy right now cause I need to be sure that I'm doing exactly what I think

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:51.640
I'm doing and, uh, a lot of the GUI tools on particular get for me, it's confusing.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:41:00.100
I just want to make sure that they are, have a merge plan and pattern that

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.500
will help them be successful in a branch.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:08.810
And one of the things that I worry about and they rightfully worry about is, well,

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.410
how long do I keep the stuff in a branch?

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.090
And I don't like long, long running branches, although with the right plan, you

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:17.010
can keep things merged and in sync with the develop branch, so you're not.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.050
So when you have to merge back, it shouldn't be a problem.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:27.530
Those things are possible, but again, feature flags for merge to develop

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.570
frequently behind a flag, get your code in there.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.770
If you're worried about things diverging too much, but get it behind a flag.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:39.920
But you're going through is risk retraining, right?

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.440
The people above you know the rules for managing risk.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.360
And they're like, this is to the right.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.400
It, the concepts of ask mode and, well, I call it ask mode.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.680
It's just, it's just release management.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.390
No, but it's asked mode, right?

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:01.350
I wouldn't be surprised if you, if someone above you recently has talked

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.430
about bug jail or any of these bug jail hasn't come up.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:08.350
In fact, one thing that's come from this is I should talk about one of the

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.390
thing is we have still, I believe in the popcorn, popper theory of shipping

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:14.070
software mostly.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.390
So the popcorn, popper theory is you've made popcorn before.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:21.230
And whether it's the microwave or Jiffy pop, same metaphor works.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.070
The popcorn is popping like crazy.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.480
Where it's work coming in, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, bugs coming in.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.320
We're going to fix those right away.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.680
Pop a pop and the end, it starts popping slower pop pop pop.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.640
And there's a fine line between getting the most popped kernels

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.040
and burning your popcorn.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:38.640
Yep.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.600
That's when you ship.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.280
So we have an income.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.440
We're still popping, not super hard popping a reasonable amount, but we're,

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.840
but our fixed rate is higher than our incoming rate.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.640
And it's all good.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.880
But one thing has come from this is for a long time.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.400
I've been trying to get to, I was close a little while back and then things

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.640
went off the rails of, of how many old bugs we have.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:07.800
And right now we are almost on top of keeping our, basically our bugs older

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.120
than three days at zero.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.640
We have like 15 right now.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:11.920
Good.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.760
So my goal and the book again, buy off on this as we get that to zero, we keep it

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:23.040
to zero and the line I'm using to explain it is if as long as fixed

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:28.400
rate exceeds accepted rate, that indicates, so the number of bugs are fixing

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.200
is more than the number we're coming in.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.360
That indicates that we can take on more feature work.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:35.640
Yes.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:45.090
No, I, I would, I wouldn't approach it that way, but that's fine.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.320
The way I approach it is bugs take precedence and when the bugs are dead,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.400
yeah, then you use your available resources, potato potato works.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:55.280
Right.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.650
Um, it's been great though.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:02.010
The point is that getting to this point and trying to working with their definition

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.170
of shipping versus my definition of shipping, uh, we've been able to get that

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:07.850
number close to zero and, and with the goal of getting it to zero.

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:08.770
So I feel good about that.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:15.440
And once, and then with the added dynamic of we're shipping all the time after that

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.880
they understand the importance of keeping that at zero.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.360
Yes.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.440
You were talking about deployment models.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.400
Have you, did you ever go and look up?

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
It's all public domain knowledge.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.320
Uh, the safe version of the deployment model.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.880
I read through that a long time ago, maybe a year, a year and a half ago,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.520
but I don't remember it.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:44.620
In a nutshell, version three, oh, a safe there's now a four.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.940
Oh, so I, I haven't reviewed the four content.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:53.580
And then they make big changes as they learn new things and learn better strategies.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:01.590
There's essentially three branches, maybe four, four, we'll go with four that there's

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.350
the, the private dev branch on their machine.

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.910
Then there's the official dev branch.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.430
Then there's the integration branch.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.030
And then there is the RTM branch.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.120
Okay.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:20.300
So devs continuously taking it from their, their personal machine branch and

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.480
integrating into the dev branch man.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.960
In the safe model, um, you have two weeks sprints and then you have a

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:36.090
system integration team, um, two weeks sprints, the dev team, uh, then demos

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:37.370
at the end of that sprint.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:41.210
Uh, this is easily adaptable to more of a Kanban model.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:47.110
I'm just communicating it from a scrum model every two weeks, dev then

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:51.710
demos, what they are checking into the dev branch.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:52.590
Okay.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:46:01.840
The system integration team, their job is to, um, the weeks where the dev team

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.520
isn't demoing the system integration team is demoing the off weeks.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.130
So dev's going every two weeks.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:13.010
So then it would be dev demo system, demo, dev, demo system, demo.

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:13.570
You follow?

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:14.290
I get it.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:14.530
Okay.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:21.810
The system integration team is then accepting these check-ins.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.860
These change lists and they will take a change list at a time, integrate it

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:34.440
into their integration and determine whether or not that gets rejected

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.320
or moves up to the RTM branch.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:42.050
Anything that gets rejected, the integration branch gets reset to the

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.530
current version of the RTM branch.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.080
And then the next change list is incorporated and quickly tested.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:56.320
So then what ends up happening in this case is your RTM branch is always RTM.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:04.560
And, um, this integration team, their purpose in life is to

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.030
reject as fast as possible.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:13.820
So they're highly focused on proving that this didn't integrate correctly,

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.800
but as fast as possible.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.800
So you don't see much like you were talking about with these scenario tests.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:28.880
You see these scenario tests, um, uh, trying to be lean, uh, highly focused,

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.320
enabling this, this code to filter through.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:39.900
Um, you don't want to be overly pentak or pedantic on, on, um, blocking

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.820
regressions, because then you just turn into a waterfall team with this.

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.140
Yeah.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.920
This is, I get how it works.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.460
It seems a little waterfalling.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.860
Um, but I get, I get how it's not and how it maybe is.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:03.280
There's a lot more structure in up on the safe documentation in terms of how to,

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.120
how to assure that this doesn't become a waterfolly process.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:17.600
Um, the role of this branch is primarily to, um, enforce Dev's

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.400
behavior of what you expect from the lower branches.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.040
Okay.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:21.840
I get it.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.840
I'm going to read through it because I have a plan now that I like, but I'm

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.080
always looking at adjustments as needed.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:36.960
This model, along with the idea of a feature keys, I think is a, is a

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.720
good way of blocking risk.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:41.140
All right.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.260
So this is a nice segue.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.340
So we talked about everything from the Dev side, release engineering.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:49.540
We haven't talked about, uh, a little bit through the PM role in this.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.380
I want to jump to that.

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:57.200
And then, and to kick that off, we'll do that from the mailbag.

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:06.870
So on the Slack channel, one of the three dot slack.com.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:07.870
Yes.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:10.830
Let us know if you're not a member, let us know.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.910
And, and we'll add you to it.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.430
There's a lot of great content, a lot of great questions

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:16.670
that don't appear on the air.

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:22.310
We have a new member on the Slack channel, Marcus, welcome Marcus.

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:30.620
And he asks, I'm working with a team that is totally on board with going to a more

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:36.150
sustainable quality models, such as unified engineering, though the PMs are more

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.990
conventional and want to know how much longer it will take for features.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:45.310
If devs are testing and prioritizing bugs over feature dev, they really want to

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:50.380
be able to plan a soft launch and set expectations with leadership and are

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:59.320
unfamiliar with continuous delivery and no shut down, uh, polished phase at the end.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.310
Do you have any experience advice on how to tackle this?

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.120
I think we've probably both been through this.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.240
I'm still in it now.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.520
RPMs on my team still very much live in the must plan.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.560
Let's look at capacity and we'll plan for that.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.960
And they try and put in, and they do a reasonable job.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:24.640
They put in test work as part of the monthly backlog as along with the dev work.

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:27.390
There's a couple of things wrong with that.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.080
And I'll let you have probably a lot better ideas here, but what's the

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.120
quote predicting things as hard, especially about the future?

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:34.960
Yes.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:41.520
So I think test estimates tend to be just as inaccurate as dev estimates.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:47.160
But unfortunately what happens if, uh, what I've seen is you, when the

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.080
dev estimates go haywire, they just go, okay, we're not going to get the test work.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:54.610
Not always in some cases.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:51:00.080
So, um, the challenge in that transition to me is going from.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.040
So by the way, that was actually one thing that's interesting, right?

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.240
Cause the PMs are saying, how much longer is it going to take to produce

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.360
these features if dev owns the testing?

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:10.400
Right.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.840
They, um, in the prior world, right?

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.320
If tests on into testing, it's all, um, right.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.640
You're just shifting who's doing the work.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:20.880
Right.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.840
The same works happening.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.560
The same works happening, right?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.720
But now PM has this view it's going to take longer.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:33.320
And I think that's interesting because, um, it almost articulates a belief

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.840
that I believe PMs have had.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.760
I don't need tests to ship.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:45.510
So now what what's happened is this, this hot path to ship has been eliminated

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:48.750
from, from PMs repertoire.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.350
It's no longer in their toolbox.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:51.810
Yeah.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.580
My, all that's true.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.060
Right.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:52:00.780
And I don't know if you're going to, uh, to answer the question or try and answer

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.130
it, I don't think without actually doing any of the testing or any of the

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:07.690
development, I don't think you're going to know how much longer it takes.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.010
This is why we do iterations and learn from them.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:14.970
So pick a chunk of work that you think can fit into a two week iteration, you

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:18.770
know, stack rank, because it gets done in order and which includes things

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:23.970
being test complete and see how long it takes, see what your, what your

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:29.690
throughput is for if things are to be completely developed and done.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.580
The completely agree.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.220
Right.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:39.360
Um, the, the, the first thing is to measure the, in Kanban, the, the thing

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:46.300
I really like about Kanban is essentially once work starts in two weeks, once

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:51.460
work starts in between now and two weeks from now, that work will be completed.

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:56.430
That's that is a commitment that my team has made, but with PM engagement,

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.710
they are often more concerned with.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.230
Well, right.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:05.470
But I want to know when this item that's 10, two weeks iterations from

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:08.630
now is going to be done because I need to set commitments.

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:17.140
With operating the, this is another one of those paradigm shift changes where

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:24.820
people are, um, used to setting and resetting expectations on a six month

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:37.130
cadence and what I found is once I get, can get them to trust my model, that

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:42.570
the, the way I'm going to execute differently and realize that they can

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:49.180
trust that that cadence, um, then PMs will turn over and find out that this

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.620
model is actually more valuable to them.

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:57.680
The challenge with their model is they want to set expectations for six months

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:04.140
from now, but in one month from now, when we realize that there's this P two

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:09.930
thing that we now have to do, um, because of the learnings of what we just

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:17.250
shipped, their model doesn't account for really changing these downstream

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:18.930
it expectations.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:25.530
It really creates the world where you're trying to compress features into

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.610
a much tighter timeline than you should.

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:33.050
Um, so another shift that happens.

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:40.900
That's been interesting for me to observe is, uh, the traditional PM is, you

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:45.780
know, they want to own the feature and the schedule and be, and then the

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.220
coordination and all these things.

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:50.420
There's much less of that to do in the new world.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:56.930
I just turned the corner now where, um, uh, our PMs, what I tell our PMs is you

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:00.270
can make sure you understand what the features are based on cut, not what you

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:01.830
think is cool or not with the VP.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:07.820
Thanks, but customer, you know, feedback, and then groom and re prioritize

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.980
that backlog we can't, there's no way we can predict what we're going to do

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:16.020
three months from now, but if that, you know, you basically can figure out our

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.540
throughput and you can figure out, uh, the prioritize backlog and get an idea

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:25.570
of when things will show up, but we need to, part of the shift is getting

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:28.610
out of the habit of thinking you actually know what you're going to be

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:29.690
doing three months from now.

00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:36.250
The challenges is a lot of these PMs have been making promises, right?

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:40.930
And that's the thing that you got to, what they view is a commitment, a PM

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:47.050
who owns delivering to your team feature requirements, um, who doesn't own

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:53.440
the schedule can actually be more harmful, but you have to get rid of that.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.080
If you want to get out of the waterfall world, what I mean by more harmful

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.080
is, okay, now I just deliver feature requirements.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.320
I have no accountability to the schedule.

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.760
Therefore that's your problem.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.480
Figure it out.

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.910
Right.

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:14.590
Which is not, you want them invested in the overall team success, not just be

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:18.830
the guy on the Hill, um, making demands.

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.110
Yeah.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:25.490
Going back to say for the thing I found that works best for me in terms

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:33.440
of getting them aboard on the journey is, uh, what's known as WSJF weighted

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:40.200
shortest job first, and I basically say, Hey, we can adjust my schedule every

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.960
week, once a week, we can adjust it.

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.840
Um, but only on the work that my team hasn't started.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:51.210
So if they started it, that's going to go to completion in terms of the next

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:53.330
stuff that's up, you can change that.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.290
How you feel with one condition.

00:56:56.810 --> 00:57:01.410
I want to make sure that we are in agreement that this next set of list

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:09.240
is the highest ROI, which means business value that we predict over the estimated

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.400
cost, right?

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.200
So they bring, they bring the business value equation.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.520
There's a way to objectify this.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.880
I bring in the cost equation.

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.800
We have a discussion and then we, um, we iterate and we try to do

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.960
this on a weekly basis.

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:25.520
Cool.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.120
Yeah.

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.880
So I'll loop back to the question real quick.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.580
Uh, we're actually talking about the question.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.660
One blunt way to answer the question is going back to what you said is the same

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.100
amount of work done by different people.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.920
So how much longer we'll take a ship it on one hand, it should take exactly

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.320
as long because the same work is happening.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.600
On the other hand, it could take longer if developers are learning how to test.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.400
But on the other hand, the game of, of what I call bug ping pong where the

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.600
developer says, here's my code test says, here's a bug developers says, here's a fix

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.040
test that didn't work that ping pong game is very inefficient.

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.640
And if you get rid of that, it should take less time to ship.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:11.420
So the, so it's all boils down to iterate, learn and repeat.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:17.130
I think in the long run, it's faster, but as things come up, as people learn

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:21.450
things, there may be some time in the first few, uh, sprints where it takes longer.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:24.690
In the first few sprints, it will, it will take longer.

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:30.370
Uh, the best advice I have in this particular situation, uh, particularly

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:35.770
if you're going to go with a unified engineering model is essentially give

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.570
many, I blogged about this.

00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:39.090
Maybe we, I could dig that up.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:44.810
You give the dev team a 75, 25% rule.

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:49.690
You give the test team at 25, another 75, 25% rule.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:56.500
And then you give, uh, the, the new leadership teams in this unified

00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:02.780
engineering model, a timeline where you expect both the dev and test to,

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.820
to come to a 50 50.

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:07.700
Now, what the hell am I talking about?

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:08.700
Dev.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.340
I wonder that every time we talk.

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:17.500
Dev, your job is going to be 75% dev, 25% learning how to improve

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.940
your testing from the get go test.

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:30.480
Your job is going to be teaching dev how to do testing and 25% how to do coding.

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:37.560
And the trick for a manager in, in this aspect is to figure out an aggressive,

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:44.440
but achievable flow going back to a book ending our topic, such that these guys

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:50.680
merge their skill set and their knowledge into one amorphous unified engineering

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:59.850
blob, they both need to teach the other side how to grow and become a unified team.

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:00.770
Perfect.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:03.730
I hope that answer is good, Marcus.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:04.730
Yes.

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:05.530
All right.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.360
I'm still Alan.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.640
And I am Brent.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.560
We'll see you next time for episode 48.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.200
Bye guys.
