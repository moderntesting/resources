WEBVTT

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.500
It's up everybody. Hello, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And guess what? We're back again.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.700
Episode... How many are we, Brent? Episode number 36.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.420
All right, we're not recording. We're not. I'm kidding, we are. Yeah.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:31.600
So again, the astute three will know you record usually in the morning at 8am.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.280
Yep. And it's a good time to catch Brent a little off guard. And Alan takes far too much pleasure

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.000
in that. You know, I do. I do laugh at the misfortune of others. Did you see the Taylor Swift?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.800
Whoa! I kicked the button on my chair and I just dropped about a foot. It was like a little

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.480
elevator drop. I'm good now. Did you happen to see the Taylor Swift versus a treadmill?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.200
No. Oh, it's good. So not a big Tay Tay fan. Not a big fan of treadmills. In fact, if I were to

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.440
choose one or the other, I would choose the treadmill. But there's this video of Taylor

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.000
Swift. It's an app. It's an ad for Apple Music. We're at Microsoft. I just talked about Apple.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.840
It's great. And she's running and rapping and showing like she can pick whatever song she wants,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.600
you know, and she goes doing her thing and then she falls flat on her face. It's hilarious.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.640
The misfortune of others always... Was it Chaucer who said that? One of the three tell me

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.200
there's a line, a famous line about laughing at the misfortune of others. And I laughed at

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.160
Taylor because it was really done well. Honestly, if we take away all of our social

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.520
filters and really think about it, I think we'll all agree that there is nothing funnier

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.280
than watching somebody actually or accidentally hitting the coffee table with their shin.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.170
As long as you don't die. As long as you don't die.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.570
So how many? 36? 36 episodes. And we have hit our two year mark.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.970
We've been doing this for two years, 36 times saying the exact same shit.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:17.570
Over and over and over. And yet we have now multiple people claiming that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.490
they've binge listened to us. There's only three listeners, Brent.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.050
Yes, they rotate through. After one person finishes Ben listening, you're like,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.010
Oh, I've pretty much figured out everything these guys have to say.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.370
Yeah. I don't understand. Honestly, thank you, Danny Fott. I know there's others, but

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.850
he's one of the three now and he said he binge listened. And honestly, I can't stand listening

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.690
to myself talk for more than about 15 minutes. I don't know how it happens. I don't know how

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.980
you survive. I'm betting alcohol or massive amounts of coffee.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.040
It might be a distraction from like a commute home. I don't know.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.100
While we're wallowing in our two years of... Whatever this is.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.980
I think success is too strong of a word. In fact, I'm sure it is. Two years of therapy.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.970
In one of the topics that was rejected from today's list, as the three know our process,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.650
as we get in the room and set about five minutes writing some things on the whiteboard, we say,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.650
Yep, yep, yep, nope, nope, we order them. And then we go. And one of the things we cut was

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.170
just some stuff often listeners may have figured this out.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.090
Are you uncutting it?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.490
No, I'm cutting it. I'm just saying that they were there because I just need some therapy on

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.170
this and working through with Brent in front of the front of three people we can't see

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.890
often helps me. So if we have not helped the three and the community,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.530
maybe in a way we've helped each other.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.180
No.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.100
So speaking of hugs, I got the nicest LinkedIn comment that I share with Brent.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.220
And now I'm going to share.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.860
Hey, wait a minute.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.660
Wait, wait, not yet.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.300
Did I ever tell you that I kind of invented a drink?

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.470
Okay, no, but there's a story here. Please tell me.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.700
I call it the group hug.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.150
Oh, please go on.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.750
And it's it is just n shots of Patron.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.730
I love it.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.610
So that's so interesting. When you thought of drink, I thought I really don't. I love wine,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.450
beer, it's IPA or nothing for me. I'm a Northwesterner.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.730
I love the bite of the IPA. But if I drink a hot hot alcohol,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.020
it's almost always tequila occasionally have a gin and tonic, but I'm a big tequila fan or mezcal.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.850
So I don't know what a mezcal is.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.490
Mezcal is like this. It's still from Agave, but it's a smoky. It's really good. If you can find

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.930
a good one or really awful. If you find a bad one, the swing on mezcal I found is a bit large,

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.910
but someone at work yesterday. And once again, I'm proud of ourselves because we cannot quite get to

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.670
that first topic without a tangent. But there's a tradition at Microsoft. I don't know who started

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.310
or even if it's really a tradition, but people bring in on their anniversary of n number of years,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.230
that many pounds of M&Ms.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.470
Yeah, I don't know when that actually began.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.990
Because I didn't even hear of it.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.110
20 years.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.510
I didn't even hear of it till I've been here at least 10.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.830
Yeah. And I actually started getting harassed for not doing it like the last three years.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.670
And people do variations once in a while, and I've never, ever, ever done it. And someone

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.700
yesterday been here 11 years and brought in 11 pounds of M&Ms. And maybe I'll be a team player

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.620
and I'll bring in some on my 21st anniversary coming up this year. And I thought because

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.100
my 21 year anniversary at Microsoft is in June.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.860
Is it?

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.220
Yeah, I hit my 20 year last year. So I'll be 21 years in June.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.580
I must be 21 now.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.380
Yeah, maybe.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.740
Because I'm like, wait a minute.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.100
So because I have been working long.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.500
I am.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.810
Brent. The sight of Brent actually thinking is like freaky.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.090
You know, as it's like, first days and anniversaries as I get older, I was like,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.410
I don't even want to know him anymore. So yes, I'm old.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.770
Anyway, go ahead.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.810
My story.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.450
You're listening time. I'm glad we didn't hug.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.840
I will this June I will have been at Microsoft 21 years and 21 is the legal drinking age.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.720
So instead of M&Ms, I am going to bring in a nice bottle of tequila and doing shots.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.080
Then you want to come by my desk.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.700
Oh, but not that we drink at work.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.780
It'll be all the time.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.020
Little teeny shots.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.580
If you go to you have a bev mode just down the street.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.460
We do here.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.140
Yeah, just up the street.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.500
Oh, I know where it is.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.660
Yeah.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.780
I don't know if you've seen these things. They're called twisted shots with a Z.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.620
I really leery of pre mixed drinks.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.060
They're not. No, they're there.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.660
They're these small little shot glasses, kind of like K cups.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:38.180
And in the middle of it is is there's a divider and they put in one beverage on one side and

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.700
another beverage on the other side.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.090
And then when you shoot them, the mix and so it's mostly not pre mixed,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.170
but they're fun as hell.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.370
Some of them are really good.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.970
Next time I go to a frat party, I'll bring one.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.210
No, go get a six pack.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.050
You can test them out at home with your wife and then you go, hey,

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.610
I'm thinking about getting I don't know what are you going to get 21.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.810
Anyway, I like getting good like Patron.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.010
It's a sipping tequila.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.250
That is shouting to get its group hug.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.770
It's a group hug.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.730
Yeah. All right.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.730
Oh, so anyway, back to the podcast.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.770
We're still recording.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.330
Looks like it.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:18.770
Yes.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.970
Oh, indeed we are.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.530
So I got a nice we got I got it.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.330
It came to my LinkedIn inbox, but I shared it with Brent.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.580
A very nice comment from a LinkedIn, a linker.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.140
What's it called?

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.620
A linked someone I'm connected to.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.420
Yeah.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.980
That sounds very new agey.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.180
A connection, a connection.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.460
Chris George.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.400
He says, Hey, I never thought I'd write a letter like this.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.760
Sorry, wrong one.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.880
Hi, I recently found yours and Brent's A B testing podcast and as such have found a new

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.040
use of the two hour commute time in my car.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.170
Wow.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.720
One two hour commutes a long time.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.680
And I feel sorry for that.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.480
Luckily, there's an hour we can do something else because our podcasts are usually.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.000
You think it's two hours one way.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.880
I don't know.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.640
Anyway, he says, and I say, I've been a tester for 20 years,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.960
mix of automation, exploration, management, et cetera.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.720
Sounds like a lot of the three and rent and I, and I guess in the last couple of

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.840
years have been struggling with working out how testers fit into continuous delivery teams.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.480
I've experienced the dev tester dependency cycle, which we've talked about.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.040
I love that.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.120
Thanks for picking that up many times and have been in denial that the tester role is the

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.600
problem.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.560
Listening to your podcast and the explanation of the dependency cycle and the unified engineering

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:36.880
teams.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.920
I love that he uses unified, not the stupid Microsoft combined thing.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.400
Yes.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.440
So I'm digging.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.960
He gets our lingo.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.800
He does like he's really like, this is why I'm all tingly and happy.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.520
One of the three.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.000
Welcome.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.240
It's consolidated and validated many thoughts that I've been having recently and helped me

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.040
adopt a more consultancy role in my current team to help the devs do more and better testing.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.000
So in a word, thanks.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.960
Keep up the good work.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.800
So thank you, Chris.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.120
Yeah.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.920
Thanks, Chris.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.800
I we love hearing that we actually do something.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.080
I'd say right again.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.720
I'm not really.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.160
Yeah.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.360
Help totally wrong.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.440
My my goal in life is one of the one of my principles, I guess, wouldn't say goal.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.200
A principle is just to help people.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.360
And if I can help you, it's good for my who I am.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.720
Well, we talked about it last time.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.840
People want purpose, mastery and autonomy.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.080
Yeah.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.400
And furthermore, they do want those.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.840
We're still working on mastery.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.400
We're still and we're still huge fans of Dan pink.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.640
Yeah.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.680
If you get bored of our podcast, just pick up like one of the Dan pink audio books and go

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.480
from there.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.680
So I run the hidden brain quite often, which is good.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.640
NPR podcast.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.000
I have to add that one.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.920
I have too many podcasts in the delete some.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.560
Anyway, I wrote back and I said, as I worry, I said, I see to say, I said, I worry that

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.520
we're kind of beating a dead horse because as Brett and I already mentioned today,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.520
we've been talking about the same thing pretty much for 36 going on 36 hours now

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.400
over two years.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.230
But I say, I worry sometimes you're beating a dead horse and he wrote back.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.110
Nice guy said, I don't think it's a dead horse.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.030
So we're beating a live horse, apparently.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.660
Many teams are at various various stages in this journey.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.220
He's been in a position where being able to react and ship tools quicker

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.740
is important for a number of years.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.020
It's quite easy.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.300
But however, howings, however, seeing how you guys change track from my perspective

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.140
are knocking it out of the park regarding frequent high quality and reactive

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:37.460
releases.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.620
Is it just inspirational for a massive organization?

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.540
So when he said change track, I'm like, wait a bit.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.940
Is he about to give us a compliment on ADHD?

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.060
That's the, you know how I don't know if you're like me, but all the podcast on the

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.460
car and then I'll think about something and I'll space out and I realized I

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.100
haven't heard the last 10 seconds or 30 seconds or whatever.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.300
So yeah, of course.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.460
So the, the bonus in our podcast is when it happens, you wonder,

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.700
am I still listening to the same podcast because we changed our.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.300
And it, and it's a positive thing with our podcast, a feature of our podcast.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.460
If you do zone out for that 10 minutes, you don't have to rewind.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:21.810
Absolutely correct.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.250
This is like the inception podcast.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:26.530
Really.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.290
It's a podcast within a podcast.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.450
Cause our tangents have tangents,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.400
but they don't have tangents within tangents within tangents because we're

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.160
too old and we will just lose track.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.600
No, I think we've done that despite our age.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:49.460
The, um, one thing I was thinking about when, when I saw this comment for the

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.700
first time, you know, a couple of podcasts ago, we were talking about how

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.260
back in the day Microsoft used to lead the way on testing.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:09.840
But, um, and then you and I sort of started this conversation, uh,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.960
earlier than the podcast, but like four years ago now where, uh,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.530
we realized that Microsoft wasn't doing what the rest of the world is doing.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:30.370
But now we've kind of, it kind of occurred to me is, is, is Microsoft again leading

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.090
the way in how, in some regards of how tests should be done.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:46.400
Cause I see the, uh, perzy, um, uh, the comment that we got today, uh, other comments I've received

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.280
Chris, yes.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.480
Other comments I've received from other folks.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.360
Right.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.000
They're really seeing us kind of showing the way.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.640
Yeah.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.760
But just like, uh, in the preface to this, there's this big book I wrote that called

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.680
how we test software at Microsoft.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.160
And even in that book, which is horribly at a date, uh, as the three know, uh, in the

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.720
preface, like there's no way for me to capture, you know, with at the time you believe it

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.720
nearly 10,000 testers, Microsoft, you know, what they did as a whole.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.720
I tried to gather some of the things that were common.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.320
Um, but even there to say that Microsoft is leading the way, I think in some places,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.280
some parts of Microsoft, there is some, uh, leadership and how software engineering

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.000
is done quickly and at scale, but there are also as you and I know, without calling

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.520
out any names, some really poor examples of how to do that as well.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.640
Yeah.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.520
No, even as the words escape my mouth, I was like leading the way to bring

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.160
Brent down from cloud nine skip right past eight, seven, six, five, four, maybe

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.520
cloud two, we'll start there.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:02.370
So I'll say, you know, I'm, I'm extremely grateful in some regards that, that the

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:09.570
the stuff we babble about, uh, approximately every two weeks is, is adding value to

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.370
somebody's life.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.610
Going back to the therapy, just talking through these things, uh, that we're

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.690
going through in our daily work helps me refocus on a lot of them.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.490
So it does it, I get benefit out of it as well.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.010
There's a reason I get up early twice a month, although we had a little break.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.010
Brent Brent skipped out on our last podcast.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.470
I just moved it one week.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.950
A digit.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:30.430
All right.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.590
Yeah.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.910
Nevermind.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.550
It was last.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.950
Yeah.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.870
We're going to try and be back on a regular schedule now.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.090
Yes.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.930
I thank you outlook.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.530
Not a not very often do people say thank you outlook.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.090
Uh, no, no.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.570
Before we go on, we have another topic around this, but I want to give a quick

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.050
plug.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.090
I always like the plug.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.690
I haven't given a talk at a conference or anywhere.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.650
I guess in the fall I did Euro, Eurostar, the mobile deep dive after Eurostar.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:05.730
Nothing since then and nothing for a while before them, but I am doing a flurry of appearances.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.210
Are you?

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:06.530
I am.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.290
A flurry.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:08.850
A flurry.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.660
A McFlurry.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.060
Is that four or five?

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.380
Three.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:13.780
Three.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.380
Is a three a flurry?

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:15.940
What's three?

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.740
I don't know.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.700
I thought that was few.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.140
Okay.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.860
But they're all close.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.900
A flurry sounds cooler.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.860
But they're close together.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.680
Does that count?

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.320
Sure.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.960
What is that called?

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.520
A storm?

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.840
Maybe we shouldn't worry about it.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:35.920
So on May 11th for our local three, I will be at QA SIG, which is at Cordez offices in Seattle.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.700
And I, this is, I was worried they wouldn't want to do this talk,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.020
but Jamie Campbell, a former Microsoft, he gave a talk there about combined engineering

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:53.820
in maybe a year ago, but it was in a way, it was a different version than

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.980
the unified engineering of my team.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.540
We did talk about it about a year ago when after that talk.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:04.110
So given my experience, it's always easier for me to give a talk if I can just,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.910
I can tell how easy, how much fun and really how good my talk is going to be

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.830
by how quickly I can run an abstract for it.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.130
Okay.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.290
So I quickly wrote an abstract and I said, Hey, I know Jamie gave a similar talk.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.540
If this, if this is too much overlap, let me know.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.260
I'll do something else.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.340
But this is kind of what's top of mind for me.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.940
And what is the audience here?

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.900
This is, it's mostly tester people.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.980
It's the three people like the three.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.470
Is it sort of an open space?

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.310
It's an open meeting.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.950
Anyone can go.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:36.350
Yeah.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.510
Yeah.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.150
Open space meeting.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.790
Anyone can go.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:43.650
And what did I call the talk?

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.890
I called it testing without testers.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.500
And I won't read the abstract here.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.500
You can go to qasig.org and check it out yourself because I didn't bring it up

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:53.900
ahead of time.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.060
I don't want to search around on my computer while we're talking,

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.860
but that's on Wednesday, May 11th in the evening.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.860
I'll talk and lobby about what's how I've done things here on my team.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.980
And a lot of Q and a interactive as my talks usually are.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.500
Is it re it's going to be recorded?

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.980
It'll be, I think they stream not only record,

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.260
they stream live.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.100
So check that out.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:13.420
Yo.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.460
And then a few weeks later, I can't remember the exact dates.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:24.300
I am giving a talk to a, where the audience is a special interest group in Waterloo, Canada.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.800
I'm brushing up on my Canadian.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.480
I'm going to see how well I can do.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.040
I'm going to give the talk entirely in English Canadian.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.720
And that one, I think it's going to be a similar topic,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.880
but I'm going to do it.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.080
It'll be a little bit more broad.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.520
It'd be a combination between the talk I'm giving QA SIG and the keynote.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.200
I gave it star Canada last year about how Microsoft now tests software,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.400
making fun of my book and talking about some of the more sweeping

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.920
general changes of Microsoft versus just my experiences.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.400
And then I come home for a few weeks.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.280
And then I'm off to Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.640
You heard of it?

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.520
I guess they have like restaurants and these gambling places there.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.160
And they also have a conference called Better Software,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.240
where I'm giving a, you know, this a three and a half hour workshop on.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.440
Do you know what it's on?

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:15.920
Testing.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.360
What kind of testing?

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.460
Exploratory.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.060
Oh, no, Brent.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.220
The three will be automation.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.420
How about AB testing?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:25.680
Is it?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.440
It's on experimentation.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.480
And then I'm home for the summer after that with nothing else planned.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.760
But really, it's a large expansion of talk I gave there last year,

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.640
sort of at the last minute.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.520
So it should be a lot of fun.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:43.970
I'm so glad you played right into that.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.330
That was it.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.370
It's so much amuses me on so many fronts.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.770
Whenever you bring up, you're doing talks on the AB testing.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.420
I'm sure you do it just fine.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.700
It just I'm like, okay, why not?

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.870
Go, Alan.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.150
You did a great job last time.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.390
Yeah, thanks, Brent.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:11.890
All right.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.050
So shall we start the show?

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.270
Longest.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.270
No, not the longest.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.390
Not the longest.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.430
This is how we roll.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.930
Actually, we've gone through four of the items on the board.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.530
Yeah.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.930
One says one is episode 36.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.050
One is two years.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.130
I think we covered those at about the first 30 seconds.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:46.610
So my product, which is hard and fun and interesting and for all sorts of different reasons,

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.570
we ship to our production server once a week.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.550
You do that now.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.190
We do that now.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.150
We ship once a week.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.030
Okay.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.390
So you deploy once a week.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.630
We deploy once a week, yeah.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.230
But because I still think you're extremely locked down.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.600
Can anyone go to it?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.800
Can I go go to it now?

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.020
Different.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:14.540
We deploy to our production server and there are about 200 users at Microsoft outside of our team

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.700
who can use our product for what our product is designed for.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.700
You're not one of them.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.980
No, I am not.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.220
I offered for you to be one.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.100
You said, I don't know.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.540
I don't want to see it first.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.780
So I'll show it to you after the podcast.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.100
Okay.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.540
And then I'll get fired.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.060
But I'll show it to you.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:32.540
Okay.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.060
Anyway, we can get you on board.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.030
If only you knew someone who was sort of in control of access.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.430
I don't know what your product does yet.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.790
Oh, it slices.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:44.590
It dices.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.390
It makes your, it's a floor wax and the dessert pudding.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.790
Every product coming out of Microsoft today does slicing and dicing, it seems.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.510
But ours seamlessly integrates into the enterprise world with more buzzwords that

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.870
I can't flip out of my face at 8 30 in the morning.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:00.430
Right.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.590
They all seamlessly integrate as well.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.030
So I didn't I say that?

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:04.430
You did.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.590
So we have for customer and business satisfaction.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.020
Anyway, our product.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.900
You forgot the line.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.140
God, we can't, we cannot get to the point.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.180
Like Brett and I are kidnapped.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.500
They have guns to our head and they're saying, tell us, tell us where the diamonds are.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.220
So, oh, did you know that diamonds are from carbon and.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.540
And carbon.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:40.140
Oh, oh, this is about a baseball diamond, but I was at, you know, it's like, oh my God.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.300
So anyway, so one week you say every week, every week.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.720
Uh, uh, and it's, it's going, it's going well.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.430
But you know what, Brent, it's not enough.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.820
We're going to ship more often.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.880
So what I want to talk about the subject I want to go back and forth is, uh,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:08.460
pros cons, pitfalls and benefits of, and I have a live list of these myself because

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:15.440
I've been preaching them to the team of going from shipping once a week to once a day, once

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.200
every weekday, let's say, and then maybe even more often after that.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.400
So what are the things in, this could be a way too open ended of a question for a,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.240
for a Brent question.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:34.080
But as you've seen teams and your experiences as you've gone from shipping once a week to

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.000
once a day or any sort of acceleration like that, what are the big, uh, benefits

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.480
and the big challenges to doing that?

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.560
And I have a big list myself, but I'm going to let you start.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:53.150
The biggest benefit, uh, bar none is the more often you ship,

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:58.580
the less risky shipping is.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:10.340
So, so shipping more frequently dramatically boosts quality and reduces risk.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.020
Well, there's with a whole slew of caveats, but yeah,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.540
devils in the details there, right?

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.580
And that's exactly it.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.380
There's a, there's almost a little yin yang thing of because we're shipping every day,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.860
um, there's a chance that, I mean, there's, you don't get that bake time.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.540
You get shipping once a week and maybe some little things begin to slip through.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:38.210
But because you're shipping every day, those things are mitigated or fixed, uh, much quicker.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:45.970
I think over, over, uh, I do believe that the benefits outweigh the scary parts that

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:46.450
come with that.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:51.090
I think there's a cultural and people thing of getting over the fact that, uh,

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.770
there may be some minor and I'm going to call them bugs because they might not even impact

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:55.410
the user.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:59.170
There may be some minor things that aren't caught because that's that big time.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:10.240
And for example, maybe there's a, um, uh, in one build, you introduce, uh, something that

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.680
causes this API to fail.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.600
Um, but it's not noticeable and you're blind.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.440
You don't have the right monitoring in place.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.520
So you miss it until you start getting reports from a large, the larger deployment.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.200
And then you go back and fix it the next day.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.320
So it was a dip.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:24.880
Yeah.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.550
But, but what that forces you to do, uh, to me, shipping more frequently is all about what

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.590
we call the outer loop.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:40.100
You know, the inner loop is like unit tests and deployment and, and, and, uh, test the,

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.140
the testing you do, the internal dogs, a little bit of bake time you get moving in

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.220
a one in whatever your release is.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.900
But the outer loop is monitoring.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.900
How quickly can you detect an error with monitoring and react to it and maybe even

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.860
deploy a hot fix?

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.780
How does that, so I'm breaking.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.420
I was about to go on there and then Brent gave me a look.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:06.260
So you're, you started this question primed with, I gotta be careful because it's a

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.820
Brink question and it occurs to me now that you're doing a great job pretending to be me.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.300
I'm answering the question.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.420
So this is again, this is the therapy part because this is what I've been telling

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:23.620
our team and, um, by Brent nodding his head, having gone through this more often than me,

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.260
the fact that that's now I want to hug you again, but not really.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.900
It's so I'm, um, talk to me some more.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:36.610
So let me put my Agilist hat on, right?

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.970
The, do you ever take it off?

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.260
Not very often.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.060
How about in the shower?

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:42.800
No.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.200
Okay.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.920
All right, go on.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.360
It's, it's water resistant.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.250
There is a great book.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.850
I may be forgetting his name, but Donald Reiner.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.530
Is the author's name.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:59.250
It's the title, I think is product development flow.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.210
Oh, flow.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:00.370
Yeah.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.610
Hop in my bookshelf.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:02.770
Yeah.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:09.060
He, if you, if you want to understand Agil and there's only one book you're going to pick,

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.580
that's the book.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:18.850
Uh, because he goes through, uh, lots and lots of white papers, lots and lots of science

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.010
and evaluates which model is better.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:23.330
Okay.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:29.570
And now what you're talking about going from one week to one day is sort of the discussion

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.450
of small batch versus large batch.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:39.650
From a, from an Agil point of view that that's, that's how we refer to it in the vernacular.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:48.340
Small batches, meaning you're constantly shipping small things is significantly better than

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.900
constantly shipping large things.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:28:01.330
Um, those of us in testing can, can recall, uh, so for example, the periods when there's

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:06.690
a massive stabilization period and there's a co-complete date, right?

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.690
Well, and I'll interject there.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.490
There are teams.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:13.970
I know that Microsoft who even within the last five years have had a coding milestone

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.200
where three to five months, I don't know how long, three months were spent where you

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.840
write code.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.600
Uh, you don't stop, you don't get this is flow also.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.680
Cause you don't want to get out of your flow and fix bugs

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.650
because you can use the six months stabilization period to fix your bugs.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.290
You're right now.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.130
And it's just a stupid process.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:47.020
So the, um, so they spend two years writing up all of the bugs that they're going to

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:54.700
fix in the final six months without any sort of customer feedback as to which ones

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.220
are important, which ones aren't.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:02.880
Um, so I, I think I've told the story on the podcast.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.320
So when I went to Bing before I was a, um, I went to Bing primarily because I wanted

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.120
to learn service software.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.480
I had not at any point in time shipped the service, uh, in my career.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.960
So I wanted to add that little bullet to my resume.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:27.730
And, uh, at that time, Bing was known as the, the most agile team.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:28.930
Okay.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.010
Um, so I went there.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.170
Uh, I studied up on agile.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:38.610
I was not yet a, uh, uh, a coach by any means, certainly not certified in any way.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:47.460
Um, and read several books, uh, before joining and I hit the ground running and

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.380
we started a scrum model.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.140
Now they had already been doing scrum.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:59.280
Um, and we made a, we decided to do a scrum model and there was a pre-existing

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.360
asset, which I didn't like the design.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.260
And we decided as a team to completely refactor the design.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:13.570
We changed a major piece of every component and we did it in two weeks.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:22.370
We were proud, but just like every team ever, um, we did a bunch of features and

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.770
then we were like, ah, integration will be easy.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:32.880
And we ended up trying to integrate at that, the 11th hour before the sprint was done.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:42.380
And that two week sprint cost us two months of unwinding because we had changed

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.340
everything.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.220
And of course, none of it integrated.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:54.510
Um, it was funny cause when, when I had, when I had taught my team the scrum

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.430
model, I said, we're going to start with this, but then we're going to shift to

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.390
the Kanban model.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.970
You knew right off the bat, you're going to go on bond.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:02.210
Yeah.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:10.580
Uh, the, the, I can't tell you why I knew off the bat.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.620
I just had forgotten, but if he had asked me back then, I would have told you.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.100
Put a pin.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.020
I want to come back to that in a minute, but go ahead and go out.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:24.500
So the team after hearing, after going through this experience, like our,

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.220
it was our second sprint that we had ever done.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.210
It took us four sprints to fix it.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.040
And, uh, after that, my team essentially revolted.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:40.910
They said, Hey, we want to go with the Kanban model now.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:54.670
The, um, and the Kanban model is one of the things is, is you don't do these massive

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.390
integrations.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:02.850
You integrate one small work item at a time and then everyone spread out.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.830
So when the, I had a team, a set, there's a subtlety there.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:11.540
That's important though, because it's goes back to batch size a little bit or

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.420
a work item size.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.820
I'm having technical difficulties.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.540
I'll help you in a second while you're dropping.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.500
I'll fix it for you in a second.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:21.620
Stop playing.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.340
Stop playing with the brand.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.980
I figured out.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.860
Stop playing revenue.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.660
Oh, great.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.110
Physics come to AB testing.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:32.910
So the, uh, the size of the ticket on the Kanban cord on the Kanban board.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.190
What's a Kanban cord?

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.310
That's interesting concept.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.110
We'll come back to that.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:42.350
One could be integrate into a ticket could be integrate.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.430
No, I could wouldn't be a good one.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.230
Or do you mean a column?

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.230
No, a ticket.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:50.350
So it could be, you could, the point is you could have an item on there.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.830
It's way too large and it would run in the same problem.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.190
So part of the part of the board, part of what works is you need to have,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.790
uh, items that are, uh, smaller.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.670
Yes.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.940
It took a long time to make that point.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.420
I'm very sorry.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:14.260
Uh, we even today, um, the, the policy that I, I did back when I started in Bing is what I've

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.220
kept doing.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.500
I haven't changed that one.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.660
Um, one of the things that most teams are aware of when they go into this and they're focused

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:29.580
on waste is how much time is wasting wasted rather on planning.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:38.540
So the Kanban method, um, I kind of do and planning, I now kind of do a hybrid of multiple

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:38.940
models.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:44.460
I think we talked about this a couple, three, four episodes ago, but the Kanban model

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.300
is essentially saying waste is or planning is a complete waste of time.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.260
Um, I don't know if Kanban says that directly.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:56.420
The Kanban method does the one by Dave Anderson.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:02.820
So he, the, the framework called the Kanban method invented by David Anderson at

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:03.700
Microsoft.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.500
Surprisingly, when I read that I was surprised.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.220
I'm like, what?

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.940
This awesome thing was invented here.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.510
Um, yeah, he invented it here and then left.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:20.780
And then he actually deployed it, um, and, and made his success in an entirely

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.660
different company.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:31.570
Anyway, um, basically says as long as the work, everyone agrees there's an 80% chance

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.490
that it takes two weeks or less.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.710
Good planning done.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:42.160
And that sort of lightweight model, uh, works.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.040
It works very well.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.720
The, what, um, because it'll get caught, uh, in, in the next phase, which is sort

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:56.240
of an analyze phase where you have to deconstruct it into the work and, um, we

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.840
don't let the ticket move on.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:06.400
If that person or the, the, the people who review, if any of them believes, dude,

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.440
there's no way you're getting this done in two weeks or less, then it, then it

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.120
gets broken down into different tickets.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.080
So what are your columns?

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.520
I actually want to dive into Kanban.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.280
You're used to Kanban here a little bit.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.160
What columns do you use?

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.120
Um, the columns I use are the first one is analyze.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.400
Then it goes into engineer.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:33.780
Then it goes into release, then customer validation, then done.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.170
Okay.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:35.650
Okay.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.930
Um, so they come from the backlog into analyze these things.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.730
Oh, and yeah, there's backlog then ready.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.050
Sorry.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.810
Ready is the very first one.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.170
So these things could be analyzed.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.470
They, they, they're loosely analyzed.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.790
Okay.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.710
So, but ready moves to analyze.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.750
So let me go again.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:58.670
Backlog ready, analyze, engineer, release, customer validation.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.990
Done.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.460
So I follow the backlog.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:10.370
Basically the backlog to ready is, is like a traditional product owner, a

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:11.490
scrum type process.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.650
So my team can pick whatever they work.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.050
They want to do in the ready column.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.230
Okay.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.630
Any, any ticket in the ready column is open to them.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.310
Anyone can take whatever they want.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.470
That is not pre-assigned.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.300
But only I can put tickets into the ready column.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:38.140
And the promise that, that I make, and when I put tickets into the ready

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:45.570
column is that these are the next set of things that from the best available

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.450
information I have, we'll add the most business factor.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.010
Okay.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.850
Do you use a physical board or?

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.250
I do.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:58.290
So good, because I've been playing with digital boards for our team and I ended

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:02.690
up making a physical board first for some part of our work, not all of it yet,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:06.690
just on the window behind my desk, because there's something about a

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.050
physical board and I want to move it later, but so this is just temporary.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.450
But I can explain it because I've had this question because I actually, um,

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:19.810
okay, I want you to explain it because reason is I think physical boards,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.810
the action of move physically moving a ticket for one column to the other.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.730
And me and having, when you go to is one thing.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:32.370
So one, the physical action, I think is, uh, it going back to damp pink.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.610
I think it shows you get progress from that.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:34.850
Yep.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:35.810
More than digital board.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.450
But even moreover, I think the digital boards, because they,

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.130
they can be open or not on your computer and everybody has a different view of them.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.890
One of the principles of Kanban is visualize your work.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:53.330
And I think having that board in a place that your team can all see multiple times a day and know what

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:59.330
people are working on. And just, I think that physical board for me is, uh, a better way of

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:03.490
doing that than the digital board. But I'm curious to hear your answers as well.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:10.050
I will tell you that I have figured out what is the ideal board.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:16.660
Um, but I haven't yet figured out a way to build it.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.100
That's cheap.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:26.220
The ideal board would be a digital board, but on one of these gigantic touch,

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:32.880
touchscreen monitors in a place of a physical board where, where people

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.080
have the tactile experience where they move their tickets to done.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:45.970
The reason why a physical board is more powerful is because of the social influence.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:52.290
The fact that you have a physical board requires you to have a regular standup where everyone gets

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:56.610
together. Um, forces transparency, forces, knowledge sharing.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.650
Yeah. It to me, the transparency is key there for it.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.610
It encourages, obviously forces, but it encourages accountability.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.780
I know in people are built, it not only is accountability, but it also

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:14.100
allows people to have recognition. So there's the negative thing like,

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:22.800
Hey, Alan, I see you have five tickets. All of them are over SLA, which in my vernacular means,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.280
um, you've gone beyond the two week limit. Right. So that's, there would be two crimes

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.320
in there. You're multitasking and, um, everything's over SLA.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.040
So, um, I'll interrupt for a second. So when I think of Kanban, I think of two main principles.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:44.720
Uh, one we've talked about before, visualize your work. Other one is limit your work in progress.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.320
As a manager, how come you let me have five open tickets at once?

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.570
Uh, what's your deal?

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:56.370
That's actually the thing that's also cool about Kanban is it does support autonomy.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:06.030
So if, if you have five tickets in flight, um, you made that call.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.790
Boy, I was stupid, huh?

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:17.870
I will as if I'm the, if I'm the, the, what we call the Agile coach, which kind of takes on the role

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:25.570
of like a scrum master, but it's Kanban not scrum. Um, if I'm in the scrum master role and I see you

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:30.140
doing that, whether or not you're my employee, I will give you crap about it.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:37.340
Alan, you, all of these tickets are now over. It's because you're multitasking.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:45.580
I want you to pick three of these tickets and hand them off right now. It will like right during

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:50.060
standup. But, but Brett, they're, they're almost done. They're, they've, they've been 90% done for

00:40:50.060 --> 00:41:01.380
a couple of weeks each. Great. Yeah. Then that handoff should be easy. The God, where was I going?

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:08.340
I don't know. Oh, so the, the, the ready column. So you said visualize your work,

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:16.370
um, limit whip, limit work in progress. Right. And the other one that, that is just super critical

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:24.460
is pull. Don't push. Um, you're looking at me puzzle. No, no, no, I get it. Um, the,

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:32.860
so the, the ready column itself will have a whip. Um, cause some, some teams, when they

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.180
first roll this out, they just make their backlog and the ready column the same thing.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:44.420
And I go like, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to put, I'm going to force a limit on me as to

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:51.300
how many most important things there can be. Right. Right. So putting a whip on the ready column forces

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:57.890
people to say, I don't know if you've ever heard of this speech, but I back in the old days,

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:04.980
the first decade we were here, I heard it all the fricking time, the tyranny of, or yeah. Yeah.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:15.550
Which is essentially in an, in an enablement argument to say, Hey, multitask and don't incur any cost.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:24.290
And it's kind of like saying gravity work the other way. Like multitasking, uh, the, the mythical man

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:32.530
month, um, there's all kinds of proof on this that multitasking slows you down. It, it isn't,

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:40.820
free. You can humans cannot context switch freely. Anyway, where do you want to go next with this? I've,

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:47.540
Oh, oh, we have now officially gone from tangent to tangent to tangent. And now I'm lost.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:52.660
It's AV inception. So we were talking once upon a time about shipping more often. And,

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.580
Oh yes, I'm a big fan. I'll just kind of steer us back here. Um,

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:01.970
I like this conversation, but I'm a fan of Kanban as well. And I also limit our,

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:07.650
on our digital version, uh, my small little teams, um, ready calm. What do I call it? Um,

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.370
I call it something else. I can't remember, but it's ready.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:14.850
And then what I would do, actually, when you go from one week to one day, the one thing that,

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:22.420
after to in, in a feeble attempt to try to add some value to the 15 minutes of babble,

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:27.620
I just did. Um, it does occur to me that when you go from one week to one day,

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:37.380
what you, you want to decouple each developer's cadence from the ship vehicle. In other words,

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:46.260
Hey, whatever is checked into this branch goes live daily. If you, if, if your stuff is not ready,

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:51.620
do not push the master. Okay. And so our, our, uh, branching structure is a little different from

00:43:51.700 --> 00:44:00.180
that, but we, um, uh, we will still pull from our development branch to a, uh, pre-production

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:06.820
branch daily. And then later in that day, um, that branch, once we've done just a little bit of,

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:13.860
of validation, uh, user experience, evaluation, et cetera, that will go to, uh, production.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.100
So there's a couple of things that we talked about the outer loop and getting monitoring in place.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:26.770
Um, uh, that is often the best way to make you do something is to force it to need to happen.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:31.730
We, I'll be open. We don't have the outer loop. We need to be able to do this. So there's going

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:36.610
to be a pain point as we do this. It goes, Oh, wait, we're blind here. We need to make

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:42.050
sure we have the monitoring here. So I'm willing, I'm willing to take that risk to force what I

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:47.090
think that important monitoring, which good monitors are to me equivalent to good tests,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:55.790
um, to force those to happen. So one of the things, um, God, how many years are you going to tangent?

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:03.060
Cause I had more to do here. No. Okay. So my variant of, of Kanban, right? I listed off the

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:08.960
columns that I used in, in that variant. This is a re tangent. No. Okay. Okay. I'll be quiet.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:17.760
If you remember, I, my columns, we released, then it went to customer validation, then it went

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:28.820
to done. Um, what that customer validation does to a team is you can't call your ticket done until

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:37.460
you've proven by whatever means you have available that the customer is now getting the value

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:44.720
intended out of the, out of your ticket. Right. So in this particular case, if you go to daily,

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:52.400
so let's say I work on, on your team, um, we're shipping daily. I just finished what I believe

00:45:52.400 --> 00:46:00.500
is my feature. I released it. It is now in the wild. I can't move that ticket to done. I can't

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:09.300
work on the next feature or bug or whatever, and tell I have proven to you, um, the guy taking the

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:17.360
role of the product owner that is doing what we believed it's doing, which means I have to have

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:23.600
telemetry or I have to have a customer to go interview, which is the two most common ways of

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:30.560
doing customer validation. Um, there is a team at Microsoft, the SQL server reporting services team,

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:38.640
which I used to work on. So I, I taught them this stuff. Um, they're about to ship and I am,

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:47.780
my team is one of their customers now and I'm finding, uh, bugs or, or feature requests. And now

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:53.220
they're, they're giving me what we call a CV customer validation, a CV request all the time.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:56.020
Hey, Brent, can you CV this? Here's our bill, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:05.010
So it's fantastic. It gives me the opportunity as a customer to say, no, that is not what I want.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:11.680
Right. And, uh, leads into experimentation a little bit. Cause one of the things we do when

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.600
someone has a new feature, we have a very simple mechanism, what we call feature flag, put the

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.720
feature behind a flag, meaning has to be turned on explicitly. Um, and we can do that for a

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:27.200
subset of users and, or, or for all users, when, when it gives us a way to, uh, not like here's

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:32.080
a brand new feature that may be disruptive, turning it on for everyone at once may not be the best

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:39.680
idea. A B testing and exposure rings and flight control and all of that is really critical when,

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:47.020
when you are really live and you have more than 200 users. Great. Because it,

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:53.660
you can't interview them all. Right. You need telemetry and data and those assets in order

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:58.060
to scale. Right. I think that's the big shift. Like right now we can get away with a team like

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:05.100
mine shipping once a week can get away with bug reports and, um, you know, uh, little mini

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.940
stabilization. I called it bake time. It's really just stabilization. We can get away with that

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:14.700
shipping once a week, shipping daily or more often, or even twice a week, uh, that outer loop,

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:22.620
that monitoring, that, uh, being able to react to monitoring and alerts are just, it's critical.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:27.900
Waiting for test results is, uh, not the way to do this. The one culture shift that you

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:36.370
might encounter when you, when you go into this one is, um, what we call swarms. Okay. So

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:44.300
once you're shifting to prod daily, you have to sort of create an entrenched

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:52.580
life site first mentality. Absolutely. Like life site cannot be down. This is a service.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:49:00.900
It can't be down. And any bug discovered in production has to be resolved within the,

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.980
my team is within the next 48 hours. Oh yeah. I would say less than that,

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:11.460
but depending on the severity of it, if you have the, it's a reasonable SLA

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:17.700
is directly related to how quickly you can react. If you have the automation, the tooling in place

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:25.460
to do it. Um, you also need to have the ability to, if you look at the bug and you go, Oh crap,

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:32.020
this is on the floor. I can't get this fixed in 20 and 48 hours or whatever your SLA is.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:40.340
Then you must have the ability to do a 15 minute revert. It just, it's, you can't have life site

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:46.880
down. Right. And then once you have something like that in place, the magic really starts

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:53.340
to happen in terms of getting your devs aboard on the culture because devs don't like being interrupted.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:50:00.220
And if you have the principle of life site first, then them, they deploying crap to production

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:11.550
creates this loop where they created the, the, this, what we called swarm tickets.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:17.390
Swarms are essentially bug tickets, but on my board swarms are the only thing that actually

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:23.630
cause interrupts because life site first and Hey, Alan, if you don't want to be interrupted,

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:29.550
quit shipping shit. And they learned that on their own very quickly that they're in control

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:35.260
of their own destiny on that one. I agree. Yeah. That's a good plan. Do you want to do the last one?

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:42.850
Sure. Okay. So I gave, um, we're in, uh, lovely Lincoln square Bell view and I gave, uh, Brent,

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:49.460
uh, not even a tour. I showed him where I sit, but, uh, I have a kind of, uh, cool little space

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:57.220
where there's, uh, four of us work together, uh, on the areas I work on and we have a nice little

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:03.090
open space. Um, open space is a big topic at Microsoft and in the industry, as far as,

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:08.930
you know, how teams are organized and sit, uh, there are excellent ways to do it. There are good

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:13.890
ways to do it. And there are horrible ways to do it. And Microsoft who because it was such a big

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:22.910
company had done all of them. It's great. Yes. Mostly we found all kinds of different ways to do

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:28.990
it really bad mostly because often people see open space. Oh, open space is better. Okay.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:36.670
And then you end up with a, I'm not going to name any teams. I know one building, which is basically,

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:42.750
I call it a barn. Yep. It's huge. Like, it's like Rose, it was like study hall.

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:48.350
It's not really, it's a barn. It's not open. It's not open space is meant for collaboration

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:53.470
and working together and being able to have those quick conversations. So it's interesting, um,

00:51:54.530 --> 00:52:06.000
back. So the first team to do this at Microsoft was the Xbox org. And I happen to think so.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.120
I happened to be in Xbox when it happened. Right. This was just before the commons were built.

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:17.330
And yeah, I know. I think there were teams doing it before then. The prevailing,

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:26.930
maybe the prevailing pattern that I noticed or noticed before then were, uh, uh, the shoe box

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:35.360
office, right? The, the office where you, you basically get a four by six office, um, with

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:44.000
a big heavy wooden door. Yes. So like the, the offices in my building in Bing were, were like this.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.720
Oh yeah. You get this small little thing versus the old school, like, yeah, you got glass doors

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:54.000
there a little bit, a little more open, right? Call those the open office, but not open office.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:01.890
Yeah. Um, what, when Xbox, uh, did this move, whether or not they were the first fair point,

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:09.730
when Xbox did the move, the spaces were labeled as collaborative spaces. Okay. And over the last

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:16.370
10 years, it has been shifted to open space. Well, it's, it's been misinterpreted a bunch

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:21.250
of different ways. So, um, let me put it in perspective. When I have like an example here

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:28.290
and, uh, even when I was an E E we had a really nice team room. Uh, the idea is that we're all

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:33.230
working on the same thing. Uh, we have an area where we can work by ourselves and there were,

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:40.750
where we can work together. Uh, and those things I think are important, uh, where it's been screwed

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:46.210
up in translation. Uh, and I don't know about other kinds of, but I can talk about Microsoft is

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:52.860
one, the barn, but two I have, there's been a few buildings remodeled for open spaces recently.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:59.980
And I have a, uh, colleague for example, works on a team in one of these buildings and it's,

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:05.740
it's a big, they have rooms that hold, and to me, the ideal team room size is, you know, less than,

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:12.530
less than 10. I like, like four to eight. It should be, uh, it should be able to fit

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:22.000
one whole team plus whoever the manager is that sort of scope. It should be a functional working

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.400
team. All right. So, and maybe it could be a little bigger. Um, but there's a lot of

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:32.640
these open space rooms built to fit 18 to 20, which I think is a little large. I think it's

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.080
too large for a team. Maybe if it's all the same team, it's all right. But the problem is,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.560
is they don't have teams this size. So he's working on the, the six people that he works

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:45.440
with are all together plus some random PMs and if, and a few other people, they just kind of

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.520
shove people in and go, here's an open space, but they're not working on the same thing.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:54.720
They're working on, they're just, they're two different or two, three, sometimes four

00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:00.560
different projects going on in one open space, which is, I think not cool.

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:10.750
It creates, um, it creates an environment that does the exact opposite.

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:15.310
And to me, it's critical because it's not just, I lost in translation. It's happened with,

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:19.790
you know, you know, agile has been bastardized in the same way, a million ways.

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:24.110
But if you look at the open space, I think it's a very powerful thing that really, really,

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:28.990
really works unless you totally screw it up by not paying attention to the parts that actually

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:34.110
work about it. They were actually, so when this first started, right, there was a study that came

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:43.970
out and I no longer remember who it came out around 2003 that showed like a back then valve

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:49.330
and how they delivered software was, was, um, and you can still on today,

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:52.210
go to the internet and find a copy of their employee.

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:53.570
Oh, the, the, the employee handbook. I love it.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:56:01.730
That, Hey, you come in, you check out a desk, you move your desk to whoever you're working with

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:13.410
and you get stuff done. And that study showed essentially that these open spaces

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:21.410
improve productivity because they improve collaboration. Okay. And that, in my belief,

00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:26.050
I don't know if it's true or not, but in my belief, that's what kick started this,

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:31.810
this Microsoft. I don't know if it's that, that that's not it either. It's, it's more of, oh,

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:36.050
open spaces are good. The college kids like open space. Let's see if we can not do any more.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.450
That's what it is now, but it wasn't what it was then.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.730
Yeah. I'm, I'm blown away by it.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:54.480
In 2008, there was a study done by MIT that said, no, actually open spaces is not what creates

00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:02.640
collaboration and productivity, but fungible spaces. The ability for me to go to a particular

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:09.620
neighborhood, change the wall structure. Such that. So imagine this, this one neighborhood

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:14.980
you're talking about with 30 people in it in five different teams. If I can change the wall

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:21.380
structure such that now it's just me and my team in here until we're done with this project,

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:27.310
and then we'll take the walls and we'll put them wherever these walls go. Yeah. Right. And MIT has

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:32.590
this famous two or three story building where they can reconfigure just about everything.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:42.640
And it's the ability to have the environment shift actually boost collaboration and productivity.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:50.960
The other thing I'll say, Agile helps a lot as well. The, the joke I would, I would tell people,

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.320
and it's not much of a joke because I've had it validated multiple times.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:02.320
Most of these open spaces, what ends up happening is people go to it and they rebuild

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:12.460
their office world in the form of a $75 pair of headphones. They're like, I will

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:23.550
filter all of you people out. See noise canceling beauties. The, what I discovered in

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:30.020
my last move to open space and, and apparently my building, the one I'm in right now is slated

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:36.820
for conversion, the beginning of the conversion in the next couple of months. So I'll be in a

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:47.680
new building sometime soon. My team, when we moved in our, in our last adventure, we, we moved

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:54.160
from office world into open space, but I had been working with the same set of people for

00:58:54.160 --> 00:59:01.810
a couple of years before we did. And I warned them all. I'm like, no, this is open space.

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:07.410
It's not collaborative space. It becomes collaborative space based on how we, we use

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:17.250
it. I preformed that. When we moved in, actually one of my employees who, who, who is no longer one

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:22.940
of my employees, but still one of your mentees came to me and he said, Brent, have you walked

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:29.580
around all of the other neighborhoods, which is what we call these open space environments?

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:36.460
And I said, yes, I have. What's your take? And he's like, in comparison to ours, they're like

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:43.390
graveyards. So you got a whole bunch of people and there's a practice where they actually create

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:50.320
rules around silence and turn it into like a library in the middle of a funeral.

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:57.280
Whereas my team, we had, we had been practicing agile. We had learned very quickly

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:05.120
the benefits of collaboration and knowledge sharing. So when my team moved into this

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.040
environment, we were still kept together and it was a freeing experience, not a trapping one.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:17.280
So, and, and that's the key. I wanted, I'm looking at the clock, we have to wrap up here, but,

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:22.700
but moving to an open space doesn't make you agile, but an agile team.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.540
Or collaborative. Or collaborative.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.780
Matter of fact, doing it wrong will do the opposite.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.860
But an agile or collaborative team can take advantage of that open space.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.340
Right.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:38.820
And that's, so yeah, stop doing it wrong. Do it right. That's my advice.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.020
That's essentially.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.380
It's like a pile of a sell high.

01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:47.410
That's, that's kind of the advice of our podcast every week.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.570
Quit being stupid, do smart things instead.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.310
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good, that's good advice. Thanks, Brent.

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:54.750
That one's free.

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:56.590
You know what? They're all free.

01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:58.270
Good, good point.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:01.950
Except to take an hour of our time and an hour of our listeners times

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.230
that they can never ever get back.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.580
That's why we have a continuous flow of threes.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.560
We'll see how we do. Hey, I am still Alan.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.080
And I am Brent.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.840
And this was episode 36 and we'll see you soon for 37, right?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.320
Yes.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:20.880
All right.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.040
As long as math still works the same way.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.880
All right. Happy springtime, everybody.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.240
Bye.
