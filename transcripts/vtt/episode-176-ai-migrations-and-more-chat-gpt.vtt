WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
Paradigm. It's not for nickels, it's a paradigms.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.780
I got coins in my pocket, two quarters and a paradigms.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.490
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.570
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.410
testing, leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.250
Now on with the show.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.840
A week has passed and AI has not killed us. Hey, Brent,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.360
how's it going? It's been two weeks. No, it's two weeks. Yeah. I don't,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.680
time is a blur. What is time? Oh Jesus. No, I'm not doing that.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.390
My head's deeply there already. Let's just talk about,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.070
let's just talk about time for the next. Ooh, here's a weird one.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.190
I can't say let's talk about time for the next 45 minutes when I don't even

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.190
know how much I believe in time as a, as a real concrete construct.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.350
So let's just go on back. Brent is about Brett. Oh my God.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.590
You think Brett was bad last week and now he's going to explode.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.150
He asked the headphones off. He's he's left the room.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.990
I am not sufficiently caffeinated for this conversation.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.750
There. Well, it's not,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.430
it's a conversation that would be much better without caffeine and with a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.670
different stimulant.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.230
That, um, uh, the thing I'm thinking of would be more of a depressant,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.510
but yes, I get it. No, I get it too. But it's a, uh, you know,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.030
technically yes, a depressant, also, uh, unofficially a social lubricant.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.230
I spent this morning with the aid of caffeine talking to,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.310
I forget her title, someone from my alma mater. They always like to,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.870
there's a new, there's a rollover in staff at my go wildcat central Washington

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.710
university. There's a rollover in administration and staff every five years.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.140
For some reason, probably some combination of some combination of inertia.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.410
The fact I donate to the school, something,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.250
the folks always want to keep the, want to go, Hey,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.090
I mean, you just closed it right there.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.370
It's the least I can do, uh, without my music degree, where would I be?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.080
And little, that's the story I tell every time they want to go, they ask me,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.960
Alan, how did you go from music to software?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.920
And I explained the story and tell them all the parallels and they go, Oh,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.720
and then I talk about how a university is not a vocational school.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.680
And I hate that people treat it like that.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.000
If all they want to do is write code and not work with people,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.960
that's one thing. But I feel like our universities,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.740
in some programs teach you to get a job or to know the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.380
technical part of the job without knowing the social part of the job.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.500
And I'm off on a tangent here, but it's good, fresh conversation,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700
but you get what I mean.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.420
You know, people who are really excellent, elite,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.780
elite code programmers who don't know how to solve a problem because they can't

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.260
take a, they can't take a step back and see the big picture.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.340
Well, that's, that's slightly different than like the social aspect of it.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.700
So let me, let me finish my bit and you can jump in and then we'll see if we have

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.060
any real topics to talk about.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.460
So I was talking to her cause they're trying to revamp some of their programs.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.660
And I said, you know, if you're in the liberal arts, if you're in especially art

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.780
or music or dance or theater,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.840
we got to work in technology, like deep technology programming, you know,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.090
modeling, you could model your choreography, for example,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.130
lots of things you could do around the technology of music, et cetera,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.690
should be part of the program or part of the program.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.490
Because what you get from a university that you don't get from a vocational school

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.370
is breadth. You begin to see things from different angles.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.450
Simultaneously, if you're a computer science major,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.010
in addition to your normal basic and breadth stuff,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.570
you should have to learn how the arts work cause arts and philosophy teach you

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.330
to problem solve. So that's my point.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.210
I don't know that I agree with that.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.930
When my instructor puts a piece of music in front of my face and says,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.610
can you play this next week? I look at it and I go,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.770
I don't even fucking know what those notes are.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.890
And what do I do? I go back and I start figuring it out little by little.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.290
And sure enough, I come back a week later and I can play it.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.850
It's the same thing in software.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.370
It's like go figure out how to implement this shimmery blue menu.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.450
You go, what the fuck?

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.130
And you you go play with them stuff, you prototype, you go, oh,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.690
you have some discovery and realization.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.890
You come back a week later and you show off your shimmery blue menus.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.170
It's the exact damn same thing.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.410
It that part is.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.810
But your previous statement was arts, philosophy and something else.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.170
They teach you problem solving. Absolutely.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.730
No. And I actually I think that's I think it's correct.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.090
But it is not only correct. It is profoundly correct.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.050
Shut the hell up.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.490
You know what we should have. You know what we should have.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.650
So what's going to be important?

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.810
No. Oh, God.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.010
You're going to like this.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.530
Honestly, if we're going to do a proper podcast, we have to get off of Zencaster.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.210
We have platform Zencaster.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.410
If you're listening, you've been awesome.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.930
I love you. Please don't crash on me.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.930
I want a button that allows us to mute each other while we're talking.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.210
So it's like, shut up, Alan. It's my turn.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.770
Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.010
I'm trying to push it right now. It won't let me.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.370
Yeah, that's what we should have.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.050
They should be.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.650
There should be a podcast talking.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.770
More actions read aloud.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.250
No, that's Brent is going to crash as a caster.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.330
Be careful. It's a delicate beast.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.690
No, being faced.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.780
So here I I can never say this guy's name.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.540
I want to give him credit.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.700
But she missed. She said that guy.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.740
Well, yeah, that guy.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.700
That's it. That's what causes problem solving.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.740
It's essentially when you're pushed just outside of arms

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.300
reach of your or your comfort level.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.260
It doesn't matter if it's arts or philosophy or your professor

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.740
coming to you and saying, here's a piece, figure out how to play it in a week.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.020
That's one thing.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.420
Put me in the same scenario, entirely different thing.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.820
I mean, sure. Well, sure.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.380
It would be like here.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.100
Here's one that'll work for both of us.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.540
Nobody's going to say, hey, by next week, can you please do this brain surgery?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.660
We're not going to be able to do that.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.660
Not not not if, you know, it's important that the patient survive.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.820
Yeah, I given I given I give him.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.660
And I'm a sympathetic puker.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.140
So, you know, there better be janitors at hand.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.370
You know, I bet you're a blast at a party.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.240
Uh, well, if you can get enough.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.320
So unfortunately, when I drink,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.810
I immediately go to depressed and then you got to keep

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.930
you got to keep funneling the juice into me and then I shift over.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.610
But I start off with, you know, you know, the the old T-shirt saying instant

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.090
asshole at alcohol. That's not me.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.010
I go the other direction and then I kind of flip around anyway.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.610
Yeah, I don't have that either.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.660
So my coffee and alcohol, I treat very much the same, which is going to sound weird.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.900
That doesn't mean I chug both every day, but it's the ritual.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.500
Like, can I pour a cup of coffee?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.660
Like I have this new mug I got from a vendor that keeps my coffee

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.540
or tea at a constant temperature because I just like being with the coffee.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.220
I like holding it and smelling it and eventually drinking it.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.940
Having it be around me is important.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.540
It becomes my friend in the morning.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.580
A lot of times in the evening, a glass of wine does the same thing.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.660
It's I like holding it.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.460
I like looking at it. I'll smell it.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.020
Eventually, I'll take a sip.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.460
It's it's it's my companion for the evening.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.900
Sometimes in a good night, I'll have two companions, sometimes three.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.100
But for me, the ritual of having it with me

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.860
and just kind of being with it and having it be part of whatever I'm doing

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.900
is more important, far more important than any effects it has on me.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.820
Those are almost a inadvertent side effect of the rest of my relationship.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.140
That's true. It's actually something is true for coffee and wine.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.580
I just like it's a ritual thing.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.060
It's really weird. People are going to tell me, Alan, you are actually an addict.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.060
So of both. So shut up.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.460
I don't think it's weird.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:39.100
Like so I've gotten to an age where where some my mom,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.100
I think I may have picked up her.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.500
I have a whole crap load of allergies that I picked.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.980
I inherited from my mom.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.980
And one of them that I was always dreading was a sulfite allergy.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.860
So oh, no.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.180
So wine can set her off.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.650
And I have noticed.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.010
I don't know if it's the same thing.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.490
I haven't talked to my mom about what symptoms she has.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.610
But when I drink certain wines, it

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.210
it will put me into an immediate acid reflux situation.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.450
Harsh.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.360
And then I'm like, yeah, I don't know what's causing it.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.120
And, you know, the the ROI isn't there.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.100
But no, I also I also I can't be in a room with that

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.860
with that one of my Niners glasses are cups that are about

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.060
I'll say about 10 inches tall filled with ice water.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:43.340
If I'm very uncomfortable, if if if it's if it's not near.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.980
Right. It's just I might get thirsty

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.280
and then I might have to choose between getting up off my lazy ass or not.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.040
And I don't want to have to make such a difficult choice.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.040
I I have zombies and ghouls to kill.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.800
Lately, again, still playing Fallout 76.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.560
Oh, yeah, I played a little bit after we talked that I got far enough

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.240
where I was get back into it and then I got busy during the week.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.520
My play again this weekend, I've been watching TV and stuff, but good reminder

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.920
there and while Brent was talking, I raised my also approximately 10 inch tall

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.120
drinking glass filled with ice water.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.640
You can't hear the ice shake, but from the unit.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.800
Unit, I'm also while we're talking about drinks, I'm also very fond of

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.840
something else I'll hold up here for the camera.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.720
Nobody can see is the limoncello flavor of La Croix, which what I what I

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.280
what I have discovered is this flavor, particularly is fantastic.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.360
People like me and Brent love.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.160
Some people think it tastes like the worst thing on Earth.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.680
But it has the limoncello has this like almost vanilla over tone.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.840
It's complex. I like it.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.000
Oh, my God. You just described sparkling water like a wine snob.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.680
Oh, my oh, my God.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.440
It's got oaky notes and and things.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.280
It's really good.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.840
The as a brand overall.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.840
Right. Let's just do a whole episode on on

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.000
an unpaid advertisements. Sure.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.920
And at this point, everybody's like, OK, that's enough A.B.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.680
testing for this week.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.680
They talk about anything normal in two more weeks.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.720
Polar, polar, I think is in general.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.280
I like polar better than La Croix, but the La Croix limoncello tops it.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.120
I don't think I have any other advertisements.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.440
I think we're good.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.170
So let me do a quick chat.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.130
She be T update.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.130
Got some feedback that people were concerned that I was going to,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.210
you know, blow my own brains out based off of the reality.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.690
I didn't get that feeling.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.570
I don't either. I was.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.570
But I've got that feedback to me.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.820
That whole discussion, what I'm trying to do, I know right now

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.660
there are things that I could and probably should be doing

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:16.060
as a data scientist, particularly as a data scientist inside of Microsoft.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.700
I don't know if if you had a chance of playing around with the Bing integration.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.900
I have not yet.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.260
I've read articles about it doing weird things.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.060
Yeah, weird, creepy things.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.540
Yes, that's what I saw.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.020
And one of the things,

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.060
one of my peers made this statement and I'm like, you know what?

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.460
He's 100 percent right.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.300
Right. In terms of like constraints around ethics.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.980
Absolutely believe these chatbots should not be built with a personality.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.270
That's a wait till you're done with.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.390
I had to type a request into I open.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.310
I launched Bing for the first time, like in years.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.110
OK, years.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.710
And I didn't know.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.550
I don't know how it looks like.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.030
I the thing I type with a normal search engine thing.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.270
So sorry for that.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.750
I'll have to try the.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.750
So they fixed.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.390
So they fixed it, quote unquote.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.230
So essentially what happens is

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.830
GPT starts to go sideways as the conversation continues.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.430
So both chat GPT as well as Bing's implementation.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.250
They know the history of the conversation.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.730
And as you continue on with Bing, it'll start going sideways.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.490
It'll it'll claim to be deeply in love with you.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.970
Read that article.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:43.370
Express frustration that it's only an AI and it can't destroy the human race.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.450
Whoo. It goes sideways.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.050
Do you remember when Microsoft Research released the AI bot for Twitter?

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.610
No. And people taught it to be a racist shithead.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.490
It's not going to be hard.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:01.290
Right. And there's a there's a lot of debate

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.930
on these biases, right?

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.730
The somebody you and I firmly believe

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.970
I'm willing to bet a large number of the isms are bad.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.370
The racism, sexism, these are bad, bad, bad, bad.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:19.890
All right. Pretty bad.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.530
Now, what are the downstream consequences

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:28.290
of training an AI bot to be anti those things?

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.530
Right. In general, we would look at that.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.370
That's a that would that feels like it would be

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.610
probably pretty good.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:40.450
However, I'm not certain we really understand.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.850
OK, if we limit it from understanding

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.130
that side of human society, what then happens?

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.600
First and foremost, like I said earlier,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.440
these bots should not have a personality because they are not

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.400
not only are they not well prepared, but the people designing and building

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.040
these things, piggybacking off of something you said kind of earlier.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.040
A lot of the people in the software industry do not have high EQ.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.260
Yes. Right.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.980
And they are certainly not trained

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.870
to evaluate whether or not the bots response

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.630
in front of somebody who has a mental illness, as an example,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.350
could result in that person going and jumping off the cliff.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.310
Right. These things need not have a personality.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.710
And I don't want to rehash the entire last episode,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.190
but I think the trick is we're learning here to do.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.750
And what I mentioned last time, I mentioned again,

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.750
without going into all the examples, is that there is a type

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:50.270
of conversation where an AI chat bot can actually be really helpful.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:55.190
And there are types when it is either unhelpful or harmful.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:00.390
And I think over time, you know, I really think it's up to the AI bot

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:07.150
creators to help steer the conversations towards the thing that's good at.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.790
Like my argument with chat GPT is that's confidently incorrect.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.030
And I would love it if chat GPT to be able to say

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.710
that's not an area I know well.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.510
Let's talk about blah and steer the conversation towards things

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.830
is actually good at.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.030
Oh, so so here is here is a paradigm

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.310
that that I'll share and then we can go off to the mailbag if you want.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.670
Oh, mailbag.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.310
Oh, I'm going to do paradigm first and we don't have a paradigm.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.830
Oh, I like the little inflection at the end there.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.510
It's not for nickels. It's a paradigms.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.810
OK, I got coins in my pocket.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.570
Two quarters and a paradigms.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.970
We should go to chat GPT and say, write a happy song about paradigm.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.770
First and foremost, two two things.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.090
Wait, hold on.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.890
First and foremost, two things that's that's your consciousness already.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.890
Are you an AI? Are you confused AI, Brent?

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.050
And the horse you rode it on.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.910
All right, go on. All right.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:20.030
I have found that chat GPT can be explained pretty well

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.670
with the use of two metaphors.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.750
OK, number one,

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:33.350
it is the world's biggest, best parrot, but it's a parrot.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:39.390
OK, so just like if you had a parrot that that learned to speak

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.630
just like your wife, it is mimicking.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.230
It doesn't know what it's saying.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.470
It's just mimicking the sound.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.550
Well, I get it. Good.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.950
Good. The second thing, it's like a genie.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.910
That grants wishes.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:02.510
OK, the you are geeky enough to know this about genies, right?

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.080
They will grant you a wish,

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.880
but never the way because they're evil pastors.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.400
They'll never do it the way you would expect.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.840
Like if you if you ask for a wish of, hey, I wish to be a world champion swimmer.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.320
They'll turn you into a fish or a dolting.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.280
Exactly.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:28.320
The solution with GPT is very similar to to first realizing it's a parrot.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.200
And the second thing, the way you work around the genie problem

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.280
is when you ask your wish, you have to be so specific

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.520
that it only has one choice.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.980
And that's the great exactly the wish you you look for.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.430
And it's the same thing with GPT.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:50.870
Now, in terms of using it in a in a IQ type space,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:55.750
like I know a lot of people are trying to use it to like parse out log files

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.790
or generate help files to solve problems.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.670
It will always generate things plausible.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.250
But because it's a fantastic parrot,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:12.770
but it really doesn't have it doesn't have any knowledge.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:17.370
So it doesn't know that any of its facts are true or not true.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.690
Just quite honestly.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:24.730
So using it in a in a in a sort of technological thing

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:31.090
that has nothing to do with right interacting with humans or or or generating

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.970
are dealing with emotional creatures, it's just not going to go well.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.530
Right. There is a there is a law and systems theory.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.690
I don't know if you've you've ever heard of this.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:49.260
One of the laws and systems theory is that the number of problems in the universe

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.820
is constant.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.820
So as we as we create things like GPT and we go, oh, look at all the things

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.980
we can solve with it, then we very quickly realize, oh, we can have it generate help files.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:07.380
But now we need, you know, five human beings to go through and fact check.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.420
So you're saying is the law is every solution generates a new yet unknown problem.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.860
Right. Right. At least one.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.580
Right. Because sometimes a solution will will solve multiple problems,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.900
including the one that you targeted. Right.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.100
So, chat GPT. There we go.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.060
Thank you. That was the AB to the GPT testing podcast.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.220
GP testing. Take me to George.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.780
I'll be Paul will be GP testing.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.020
No, let's do a mailbag.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.900
Mailbag.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:44.160
So Rasmus, who's on my team at Unity, posted a mailbag question.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:50.470
You may be asking yourself right now, how can Alan Brand, how can I post a question

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.270
that you will answer on your podcast?

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.910
All you have to do is join our Slack group.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.970
It's free, really free.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.010
There's no like give us a credit card for twelve free months that we charge you.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.390
It's free. Go to modern testing dot or click on the link.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.510
If it doesn't work, click on it again.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.310
It'll work the second time.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.510
But if it doesn't, if it doesn't work the first time, let's go to the mailbag

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.790
or anywhere on there and ask a question.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:13.990
So that's how you do it.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:19.950
And if you are one of Alan's team,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:26.150
this is a great way to to get an active hour every two weeks of your

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:30.510
VPs time addressing the things that you care about, apparently.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.750
So anyway, it's a good question.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.430
It's relevant, but it's good for it to bring it up from a third party

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:41.470
because I was thinking about this and I know there are stories at Microsoft

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.630
about this particular challenge and how we did it.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.910
I just can't remember them.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.830
So if you help me remind me, I think we can get through it.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.830
Otherwise, I'm going to read the whole question and we're going to go.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.630
We don't know.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.070
But let me see if I can get through this.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.070
And I'm going to skip a few words because Rasmus used too many words.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.150
No, he used just the right amount of words, but it's more words than I can read.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.620
So the question is a topic around large migrations.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.860
And when you're in any sort of infrastructure support role,

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.540
whether this is my editorial, whether it's an org like mine doing cloud

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.100
infra platforms, developer experience or even anywhere in the data world

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:24.660
or even in the test world, often we're migrating stuff from one system to another.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.700
And maybe we even talked about a little bit with migrating bug databases.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.940
That's my editorial. So, Rasmus' question.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.020
Topic is large migrations involving moving years of data,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.540
i.e. moving to another platform system provider, including business data,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.940
model data, building deployment, configurations, et cetera.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.380
Here are the questions.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.860
What is the approach people are taking based on experience?

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.820
I prefer lift and shift, i.e.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.860
migrating with as few changes as possible to make this routine you're running.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.060
Editorial. A lot of teams move to the cloud this way.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.340
They'll take their workload running on a bare metal server.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.300
They'll lift and shift it to run on a cloud cloud service

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.700
and then optimize to take advantage of the cloud scaling, et cetera, later.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.300
Ways you can verify the system is running correctly on the new platform.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.900
I have ideas here besides running existing tests for the system

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.220
and experience with tools or frameworks for validating data consistency

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.860
across different platforms.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.900
For example, could the data be stored in different cloud database systems?

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.900
Rasmus' experience here is that part of validating

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.460
typically requires custom tests just for just to verify the migration,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.240
just for this purpose.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.680
Data sync strategies in case you need

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.280
in case you need or when you need to run both systems side by side.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.240
How do you not get data corruption or data duplication, et cetera?

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.080
Then there's the part where almost the harder part,

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.360
the non-technical challenge here is when these migrations

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.120
involve several teams or organizations.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.200
And I have an example I want you to talk through, Brian.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.520
You may have more insight, but I'll get back to that in a second.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.560
So thoughts on most effectively planning these large cross-company things.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.500
If you have if you have obvious examples, you can start.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.300
I have a couple of things I want to bring up around these bullet points.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.860
But how do you want to go?

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.660
Yeah, the first one, which is which is the general approach,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.220
for example, lift and shift.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.460
Now, so I'm thinking through in terms of the the

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.700
in terms of a migration to the cloud, right?

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:31.220
I'll say the Kanban side of me will say, yes,

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.420
absolutely lift and shift, right?

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:40.620
You want to you want to release as frequently as possible.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.140
So what that what that kind of means is you want to minimize the number of change.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:51.060
Right. If you try to re-architect at the same time of moving the data,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.940
there's there's a great deal of risk.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.900
And I've talked on the podcast before around how that's something

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.620
my team actually did in a two week sprint.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.300
And it took us three months to unscrew it.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.220
Incremental positive change in that direction.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:13.500
However, typical cloud with my cloud hat on

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.420
cloud strategies are different than than the old school, like on prem strategies.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:26.140
And there's some pros and cons around leveraging

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:34.050
that information or those those new architecture styles.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:39.050
In this case, I probably would do I would probably do a lift and shift.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.730
I don't think I've ever directly managed something the scope that I see implied

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:49.370
here, right, that there is a there's a program program I'm on right now

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:54.410
where where there's a bunch of teams

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.210
and we're all trying to use each other's data towards a common goal.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.390
And we have the ability to share.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:07.710
But right, because we all have different schema and different rates

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.310
at which the data comes, right?

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.830
It's a big knowledge sharing tangled mess.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:20.230
But the first question, I think I think I would start with the lift and shift

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:25.510
and then immediately improve that we have migrated it off.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.550
I guess it depends on their goal, but prove that we have migrated off the old system

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:35.430
and then start building a I guess a V3

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:42.090
off of using the now readily available cloud architecture models.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.740
You mean like optimize lift, lift and shift that take advantage of

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.620
of any opportunities for improvement you have from running in the cloud,

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.780
assuming the lift and shift is from bare metal to the cloud.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.820
I read an article today I shared in my five for Friday

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.900
on someone lifted and shifted the other way.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.700
They saved money by by it again.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.740
If you pay attention to cloud costs, which it's free at Microsoft, so you don't.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.700
But I read an article from a company who is a fairly small company,

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.860
but they move their roughly three million dollars worth of

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.420
AWS spend to lifted and shifted that to bare metal.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.300
Their own bare metal and depending on how you're using it, it can be cheaper.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.540
Networking is super expensive in the cloud.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.220
Storage is fairly expensive and not very hard to get discounts on.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:37.700
So if you're mainly building a public cloud, for example, say I want to build.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:43.060
I don't know if Dropbox is in the cloud or not, but Dropbox is largely network

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.340
and storage, I got to imagine and I could model this out,

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.900
but I got to imagine that's cheaper, totally off on a tangent here.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.980
But things to think about when you're choosing to migrate,

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.260
not all the cool kids need to be in the cloud.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:59.460
Now, it's it's actually so because of the layoffs and such hitting here at Microsoft.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.100
Right. I've I've gone through in terms of what my team owns and runs

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.300
and started a program around, you know, leaning up

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:12.620
because I figure every dollar I'm able to save is a dollar

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.300
well, saved that might save someone else's job.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.580
And I still have a desktop machine.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.220
Oh, I want to tell a story here, but I came this close

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.460
to building myself a new desktop machine I had.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.860
I have a case that I'm happy with in a power supply that's still fairly new.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.740
So I bought about really about 800 bucks worth of stuff

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.620
that would give me a pretty good desktop machine.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.980
But I stopped and bought a laptop instead.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.780
My desktop. Last time, my last last one I bought, I bought in 2018.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.020
It is still a killer machine.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.780
And when I bought it, it was 1200.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.580
And I. Whereas laptops.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.480
I mean, it's now the price of my the phone that I just bought.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.240
Yeah, I'm I just I haven't received my new laptop yet.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.000
I'll brag about it next time we're on the podcast.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.760
I'm pretty I hope I'm happy with it as it looks like on paper.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.080
But anyway, some of the things I was thinking about were

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.310
so I was trying to remember what happened and how

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.550
we migrated away from all of our old stuff into.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.700
I what's called today the absolute stupidest product name ever,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.220
Azure DevOps, but from into Visual Studio team system,

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.140
we migrated. It wasn't just test cases.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.540
There were work items that got transferred over.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.780
Was that just a database migration?

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.900
And there was WTT, which stood for, I think,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.620
wasting testers time in their WTT to TFS

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.180
product studio, the TFS like the close.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.660
How do we handle those migration?

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.100
Because I don't remember and I wasn't involved in them directly.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.870
I and I don't either.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:00.630
Like the biggest one I remember doing was slime to source.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.340
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.300
And slime was SLM.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.900
I forget what it stood for, but it was it was a it was a horrible

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:14.780
source, something manager source line source.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.540
No source blood source, something manager.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.940
I don't know.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.220
And that was the biggest one that was corporate wide.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.260
And I don't remember anything about it.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.860
And I would also say it was somewhat irrelevant to rest.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.260
Oh, it is. SLM, I don't know if you know, slime was

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.380
market. It was an external product for a while called Microsoft Delta.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.190
I did not know that we bought a copy at Middie Soft.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.150
We had it there anyway.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.550
So one thing maybe you can go into.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.430
So when you're migrating a data processing app, so you have

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.140
I'm not sure what Microsoft uses for this.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.340
It's like you may know this.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.260
So you have a system that's processing data and you need to bring up

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.460
a V2 of the system processing data.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.700
What do you do about data sync to make sure you can process like

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.820
the same data and compare without double counting anything?

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.620
Maybe Bing had to do this. I don't know.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.500
Generally just.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.300
Right. You go through and you run through and test it like it.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.500
So if you have your existing test cases, which I believe response

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.850
already mentioned.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:29.330
If it is a if it is a pure lift and shift

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.570
and then that's pretty lightweight.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.930
Right. Because you're like, OK, put input here.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.610
Did I continue to get what I expect?

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.770
I don't remember ever doing anything particularly complex there.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.290
It's different if I'm changing the architecture.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.010
So right. And let me talk about that for a second.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.810
But I can't I think I talked to someone through this once.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:53.850
I didn't do it myself.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.010
But the lift and shift is, of course, you can lots of

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.130
just search that term on the Internet if you're not sure what it is.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.690
Moving everything exactly the same, pretty much one place to another.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.290
Someone asked me once how I would migrate a network appliance to the cloud

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.340
where it's a black box. You don't know how it works.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.380
You can't lift and shift it to an insight into how it's working.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.640
And the idea behind this network appliances, they have some API endpoints

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.880
that you can call them and they give you back, you know, something relevant.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.560
Important. Basically, the lift and shift

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.240
is hard because you don't know everything it does.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.440
So in that case, you could take more of an incremental approach and put

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.600
I would, for example, maybe maybe this is a lift and shift.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.600
Like my answer there was, I'm curious to your feedback on this,

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.240
is put something like a load balancer in front and send.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.000
So one is figure out what what it does.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.160
OK, OK, gets this request and it returns this data.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.240
I know how to do that.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.800
So I'm going to just take that call and process it in the cloud

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.680
and return the right value from maybe a different database.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.240
And eventually more of a trickle and shift, shift and trickle.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.030
I'm not sure what to call that.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.830
But eventually you kind of reverse engineering.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.070
And I'm not sure if this is even relevant, but just remember

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.310
the conversation I had about this a few months ago.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:18.150
But it's eventually a reverse engineering in order to migrate it,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.710
which honestly, with some systems that are legacy,

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.830
maybe the way you have to do it.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.550
So if you have a black box and you don't know what it's going to do,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.910
maybe it depends on on how much onion peeling you think.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.910
The question is, is it a black box by design

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.310
or is it just because it's so damn old?

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.990
Yeah, but think about these systems.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.950
What about these systems that are so old?

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.790
People are afraid to touch them.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.510
Would you really lift and shift that or would you re architect?

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.620
Like, how do you go about that?

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.980
Let's say you have a crusty old system

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.700
and you need to get it running in a different database

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.340
in the cloud versus metal in a different, you know,

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.820
in some sort of different platform.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.260
How do you go about that one?

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.460
I have it.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.380
I have a very concrete example on that one.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.780
Perfect. This is why we're here.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.820
Cosmos. Yes, I remember Cosmos,

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.660
the big fat database in the cloud data lake in the cloud.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:18.380
Cosmos. Cosmos is a gigantic data lake

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.140
in the internal Microsoft.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.140
By the way, just editorial lightning fast.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.060
Sometimes the answers to your queries would come back in hours.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.060
It was fantastic.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.660
You've you've you've got it to come back in hours

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.980
because most of the things I do, it's like started before the

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.860
before you leave for the weekend.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.620
And if you're lucky, it'll be there before you leave for the next one.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:48.210
Massively big data is is the the thing about it.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.410
So they have a bunch of extensions that you can add to it,

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:57.210
including like parsing the LLS or DLLs written C sharp

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:01.330
that will take a value, you know, parse it,

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.970
do a calculation, and then output a different value.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:09.570
That DLL, there is a DLL that we relied on,

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:13.970
and that DLL had not been touched in seven years.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.050
And we decided to go and do a lift and shift

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.090
and it had been so much forgotten.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.770
We didn't even recall that that was a dependency.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.640
So we did lift and shift and sure enough,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.480
thing immediately borked on, hey, cannot find DLL.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.520
And we're like, what the hell are you talking about?

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:40.960
We couldn't find the not only since the thing hadn't been changed in years,

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.360
like no one was still around to know, you know,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.440
where it might have been been checked in if it was checked in.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.440
And so pure black box, we could have we could have just figured out

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.960
how to deploy it in the new thing.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.320
But no, that's exactly what we did is we said, OK,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.080
we had a whole lot of data, so it was very easy to sort of rebuild it.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.280
We didn't really have a choice.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.520
We didn't rebuild it smartly, because at that point in time,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.080
we had committed to lift and shift and we're like,

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.560
crap, we're offline now.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.760
We need to get back online.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.160
That said, in that same aspect I am doing,

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.400
my team is starting a a project where we're

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.800
we're going to try to build the same thing we did with a massive map

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.340
reduce into more of a streaming style, which will mean

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.580
it'll mean a bunch of new benefits.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.380
But since the number of problems in the universe is constant,

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.060
it'll be a bunch of new problems, too.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.300
So what are some heuristics you use to help determine

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.420
say as a migration project falls in your lap?

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.840
What do you what do you do to figure out whether to use lift and shift

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:56.440
migration versus a either short or quick rewrite migration?

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.660
ROI elaborate, please.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:05.810
I just look at OK, so you have two alternatives rewrite or move it.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.750
All right. Well, you just say, well, what's the benefit of both?

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.710
If there's absolutely no benefit to either,

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.090
then it's going to be whichever one is cheaper.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.370
There's no benefit to either.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.570
Wouldn't the right answer be do nothing?

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:26.050
No, if you have to migrate, your choice is lift or shift or re-arc

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.880
re-architect. It's in it's it's

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:36.160
the system is over here on pillar A and we need it moved to pillar B.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.100
We either move it or we rebuilt it on pillar B.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.340
Right. It did.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.540
You know, the London Bridge is is in Lake Havasu in Nevada.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.300
Not that it was in Arizona, Arizona.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.340
Yeah. Do you know how they moved it there?

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.820
Piece by piece.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.020
Yeah, they took it apart and then rebuilt it.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.380
Yeah, just like Legos.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.060
Right. They didn't they didn't get massive helicopters

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.020
and hook up things and fly it over a hole. Right.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.260
That's a case lift and shift wasn't going to work, you're going to say.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.620
If it was a smaller bridge moving a mile downstream,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.460
but maybe that would be the better, a better choice. Right.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.740
That's a good metaphor. I'm going to use that sometime.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.140
Moving to, damn it, Ellen.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.500
Damn it, Brent.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.700
Train of thought was already difficult.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.180
I'm sorry for having a conversation.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.820
I forgive you.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.020
I'm low on caffeine, so I'm not going to fight back hard.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.940
I'm filled with I'm filled with the bubbles of limoncellulacroix.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:43.690
When I talk about ROI, right, it's it's essentially.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.370
All right. Are there any advancements?

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:50.290
Are there any new things we could do with this system or this

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.730
with this data by doing a re-architecture

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:58.930
and real things like hypothetical, it's like future hypothetical

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:03.770
futuristic stuff when people, hey, we should re-architect because one day

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.570
somebody I'm like, stop, stop.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.370
No, shit. Oh, yeah.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:10.730
This this exactly what you're talking about, recognizing

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:14.090
our way and getting people to shut up and they go, wouldn't it be cool

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:18.570
if this goes back all the way to our very first conversation?

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:23.130
This is why critical thinking and systems thinking are so critical

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.970
to solve problems in the world of software and not just knowing

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.690
the O.N. algorithm for sorting your shoes in your closet.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.130
And going back to last episode, why human society is doomed

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:39.250
because intellectual laziness is so friggin seductive.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.370
This is what I am fighting hard against.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.170
I am a school of the

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.650
philosophical learning.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.130
I don't know what to call my school yet, but I have a school

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.010
and it's about actually paying attention to crap around you

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.410
and not and not just blindly doing shit like

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.440
now I can go in the whole blind faith and the people repeating

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.360
the same tropes over and over on LinkedIn, but I'm not going to.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.200
But the reason why they do that is because everyone has limited time.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.680
No one has the ability to research everything on their own at some point in time.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.200
But this is how this is to me.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.120
This is the area where chat GPT is helpful.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.880
I use it for brainstorming, not for solving things.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.880
Not for answers, but to help me think about things in different ways.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.400
But that's that actually sadly is one of the speeches I've been giving.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:38.760
People is essentially quit trying to make GPT solve your scenario.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:44.560
Instead, figure out what things it does really well

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.840
and change your scenario to take advantage of that.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.400
Yes. Right.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:54.600
It is nearly impossible to get GPT to stop making up shit.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.480
OK, nearly impossible, which means anything that you try to do

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:06.190
that is fact driven, it's going to cost you more than the benefit

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.350
because you're going to need at least the tech industry

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:13.870
because you're going to need people to go through and make sure it didn't lie.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.670
You can get an army of fact checkers for GPT.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.390
Right. Sure.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:23.510
However, it is absolutely the world's best writer of fiction.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.760
Absolutely.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.160
And if there are scenarios that are more EQ centric,

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.160
again, without building the personality, that's that's the thing

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.680
that scares the crap out of me.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.000
You know, did you know and we're all we lost our subject.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.040
Raspus hoping answer your question there somewhere.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.840
But did you know that chat GPT is already listed

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.680
as the co-author of several books on Amazon?

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.320
I did.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.640
I did.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.040
I'm waiting for chat GPT to get a co-writing credit on a pop hit.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.360
Well, so what is inevitable?

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.000
It's inevitable.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.920
Oh, for sure. For sure.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.920
And I don't even know what they're going to do there.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.640
Like this, the the humanities,

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.480
the humanities are going to take it in the short and curlies.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.440
Let me because I come from this background and my daughter's artist.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.120
Let me share a conversation we have had about A.I.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.160
recently, which is really interesting.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.600
And you're going to roll your eyes a little bit.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.720
But I got to share this.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.440
This is probably mainly from Molly or people that people in our audience

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.280
that that get the art side of the tech world.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.960
But I use Dolly image generation to generate my

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.160
my cover art for my weekly sub-stack article.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.040
And I started with my daughter about this.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.800
And she said, well, that's your cheating artists out of their out of their art.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.040
I say you should pay them to do that.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.280
I said, I don't know who to pay Dolly.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:56.120
These A.I. tools, they they get their ideas from art that already exists.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.440
I say if it credited them, I would credit them.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.040
I would pay them.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.700
I would love to make a micro payment or a payment of a dollar or five dollars

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.900
that would go make micro payments to everyone this artist derived from.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.520
But it doesn't give you that.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.080
I said, is it a copy of anybody's art?

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.700
There's no inspiration, maybe.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.580
But here is the deal.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.300
All art, all art, music, painting, it's all derivative.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.960
It's all derivative.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.800
OK, it's all based on like I say, every rock song is a rip off

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.240
of some blues song from 1944. Well, it is.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.000
Well, it is. But it isn't.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
You know, every chord progression has been done.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.040
Flayers of every melody have been done.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.400
There are lawsuits all the time because a song sounds kind of like

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.960
another song paintings, especially art is when it comes down to art is derivative.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.620
Art isn't the thing.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:52.140
This is the part that I learned when I was studying all kinds of bizarre

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:58.660
anti music in in grad school, especially art isn't the thing.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:03.060
Art is the audience's reaction to the thing.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.280
Oh, OK. So right.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.560
But no, but your daughters, your daughters push back.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:16.320
Is your your your stealing money from the mouths of the poor artists?

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.160
Absolutely. And I know.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.750
And here's the deal. I am.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.230
But but also I could all in one hand, yes, I am.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:28.230
And in a perfect world, I would love to make a payment for that derived art

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.710
and have that automatically just it's going to sound like blockchain,

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.590
but have it go feed all the people that derives from

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.710
the same can be said for any sort of music that's derived through A.I.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:43.630
But why don't let's say I'm not using A.I.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.860
and I make a pop song.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:50.420
There's tools. A.I. can go analyze it and tell me I could write a song today.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:56.020
I'll write a bad pop song fully original, fully based on melodies

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.860
that come to my mind at the time, chord progressions that are based

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.780
on standard pop chord progressions.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.340
I could record that song badly and then give it to A.I.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.310
to tell me, OK, who do I have to attribute and pay for this song

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.070
if I make money off of it?

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.510
The A.I. should be able to just go tell me rather than the lawsuits we have today.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:18.150
When I go record something, it sounds a little bit like Stand By Me,

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.340
which is probably derivative of something else.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.100
Just hook all art up to the block chain.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.140
So when we make our essentially derivative bit of art, everyone

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.740
who I derive that from directly or indirectly, consciously

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.900
or subconsciously gets their slice of the pie.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.700
I would love that.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.660
Then I can play right alongside with us and it's all fair.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.900
Today, we don't work in that world.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.380
And I would love to pay if there's an artist that for

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.540
I would pay five to ten bucks a post.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:52.780
I don't make any money off my blog post, but I'm happy to give money.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.980
I'm happy to support artists having been one.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.340
If there is an artist who on call every Saturday wants to make me

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:04.420
a square drawing of a weasel to use in my posts for 10 bucks or so,

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.100
let me know until then.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.660
I'm going to cheat and use AI.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:08.900
Yeah, I don't there.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:13.940
There's there's a whole set of things coming.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.460
Right. It's it's exactly what we just talked about.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:22.060
It's the number of problems in the universe is constant.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.100
It is. It is.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.860
So really what I'm connecting here is there has not been an ethical

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.800
use yet of block chain.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:37.600
But wouldn't it be the solution to help make sure that because they want

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.280
to use block chain and FTS to help make sure derivative art for

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.040
in the digital world are always attributed to the owner or creator of that art.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:51.660
Why don't we apply that same thing to to real world forms of art

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.500
now that we have the AI that can analyze them and figure out from a from a

00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:01.260
again, potentially we have the AI to potentially analyze the potential

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:06.380
database of all potential previous art forms, figure out where the derivation comes from.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:07.380
Yeah, I don't.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.620
So my my daughter is an artist as well.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.860
She and I have had this conversation of versions of it.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:20.130
And I think if any AI art generating

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:26.790
AI got accused of that, I don't know how it's going to be trackable.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.700
Right. Well, because I agree.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:36.020
I agree. But potentially, I mean, this solves the lawsuit problem in music

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:41.180
and it solves it and it helps understand the the challenge that everything is.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.300
I mean, I don't know if everyone realizes this, but everything is

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:50.180
at the very least an unconscious, unintentional derivative of something

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.940
has happened before. Well, so you've seen all the different comedians

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.500
who have to do the fun little thing by playing the 1642 16451

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.260
chord progression and then showing, look at all the songs that fit this.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.140
Yeah, there's a reason for that because there's songs people

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.500
who make some smile when they hear on the radio.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.940
Well, and then the other thing, too, I was listening on the radio today

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:14.260
that I didn't pick up what I did is but an AI is able to identify

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.820
the patterns to what makes a happy song.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.380
Of course. Absolutely. Right.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.620
It goes apparently verse, chorus, verse, chorus, and it has whistles.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:28.620
And right. And it's like it it can generate a recipe. Right.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.820
And once once you understand the patterns of things,

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:38.620
which is what these AIs do, all they do is just understand patterns. Right.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.940
But what they don't have and I would deepen this thing.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.900
We do need to close here is, for example, they're going to have

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:50.220
the most common patterns, but they don't have the the new ones to detect,

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.340
like, oh, we should close on a double chorus here.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.540
No, the way this song is going, we should close on the bridge

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.020
and little things, those little things are different.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.660
The general pattern is the same. Put it this way.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.620
Like I took theory, of course, music theory in college, and we spent

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:09.660
a year and a half study mastering the rules and then six months,

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.620
three months learning how to break them.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.820
The true create the art comes in breaking the rules in creative ways.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.420
I mean, the the art being the better reaction from the audience.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.860
So what AI will blow free AI will give you the general pattern that works.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.660
It will generally work.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.940
But anyone can write.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:31.120
There are so many general pop songs that aren't important.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.240
They're not good. They don't inspire anything.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.040
The ones that do the ones that catch you are the ones that just go

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.120
that they color just enough outside the lines to get you.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.320
And then if you're an artist, you if you follow certain artists,

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.840
I could go to a whole music show here, but you will see

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.800
they will use certain fundamental musical elements over and over

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.440
in their songs to generate reaction.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.640
They've seen happen before the half step up key change, the

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.000
the the vocal drop of, you know, up a second down to six

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.840
that a lot of popular people do over and over and over and over.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.920
They'll use those thematic elements because they know they work,

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.800
but they only work for them.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.600
So you can't copy it if you're a different artist.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.920
It doesn't just doesn't work as well.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.040
All right.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.680
Anyway, how do we get here?

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.600
I don't know, but this was a fun podcast.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.360
Anything else you want to add before we close?

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.520
I just want to say you mentioned derivative, but it occurs to me.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.000
It's something more than a new idea.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.080
And where do ideas come from?

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.640
So, yeah, what you're saying is in a roundabout way,

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.880
all new ideas derive from old ideas.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.040
That's what I'm saying as well.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.040
Yeah, everything's derivative.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.480
Exactly. And if everything is the name of my album,

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.920
when I record an album of this AI generated bullshit,

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.480
I'm going to call it everything is derivative. Fantastic.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.840
Songs to soothe by Alan Page.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.720
So if everything is derivative, I don't know.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.080
I don't know how the eyes ever going to be sued for this.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.640
Like, go for it.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.360
I don't want I don't want the AI to be sued.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.520
I want the AI to make sure people can get paid.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.680
I want artists to get paid.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.200
Yeah, I don't want to use AI to make sure it happens.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.080
I don't know how it will do that, but I don't know either.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.880
I'm just saying what I want.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.720
Fair enough.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.000
I also want pink bunnies to fly out of my butt.

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.680
Why would you want that?

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.960
I don't know. I just said it.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.840
OK, that's all for this time.

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.360
We'll talk again next time.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.920
We can talk about like how I quit my job.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.760
I'm Alan. I'm Brent. Bye.
