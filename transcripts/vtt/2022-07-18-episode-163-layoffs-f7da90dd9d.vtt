WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Any idea at all we were just talking about?

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.630
None. None whatsoever.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.080
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.520
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.680
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hey everybody. Oh, that sounds like a song.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.150
Hey, whatever. Hey.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.310
Bet worst intro ever. I'm Paul.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.750
I'm Bert.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.550
And here we are on the Paul and Bernie show.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.910
Did you catch on Twitter where the name Paul came from? Why I'm Paul?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.990
I did. I have already forgotten.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.870
So, uh, I, we have our, our lawn kind of just joins with the neighbor's lawn. So I just mow

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.870
their lawn. I just mow their lawn for him. When I mow our lawn, I just mow the whole thing.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.910
So it all looks even and nice. It would be kind of a dick move for me not to mow their lawn,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.070
but I've been doing it for a couple of years and, um, she gives gifts and the other day she dropped

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.590
off a nice gift card for a local restaurant. And, and it said, Paul, thank you very much.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.510
You make the lawn look great. So all this time she's thought my name is Paul.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.270
And I figured the only Seattle way to handle this is to change my name to Paul.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.430
It is very Seattle-y. I, I can't just, I can't, I don't have the time or energy to go over and

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.910
correct it and cause embarrassment to somebody else. I'll just be Paul from now on.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.270
You're born and raised in the PNW, right?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.830
I was born in Spokane, which is technically P N W then moved over to this here area when

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.470
I was three years old. So yeah, pretty much been here my whole life.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:03.550
So the whole Washington, the answer is yes. The whole Washington nice thing is, is bred into you.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.900
Whereas I am a transplant from, from SoCal, right? Where, where we invented, right? Road rage.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.060
It's because it's because you are more important than everyone around you by default,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.240
due to your self awesomeness. Certainly when I'm on the road, that is absolutely true.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.330
That's true all the time. You're a dick. Yeah. Sadly, sadly, I think the majority of the world

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.850
agrees with your point. Yes, they do. Yes, they do. Today was a day off at unity. Just one of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.570
our during the summer, we get an extra Friday off a month. Kind of cool. Went for a bike ride

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.090
this morning. Did my new favorite mountain bike trail. It was fun. So anything else new,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.970
tell me what's up and then we'll get into our topics.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:06.690
What is up? So spent a lot of time thinking about our last podcast. Right. I thought that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.530
one having been playing really well since he said that they're like, yeah, they, yeah,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:21.810
no, the yesterday they have. The short answer is yes, but the brand answer is much longer.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:33.810
So they now as of yesterday, they have gotten their second club record for wins in a row.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.060
Their, their, their record is 15 wins in a row. That was done like ages ago, probably the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.460
Randy Johnson era. And they have multiple times where they did 10 in a row. But yesterday,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.940
they got to 11 and I'm hoping for 12 today. Again, I would, as mentioned last week,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.900
you probably had something else to talk about other than the Mariners spot last week.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.100
If they would just put the darn games on a streaming service, I guess I found out that

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.420
Fubo has root. So I may switch to them. So anyway, what were you,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.460
what were you reflecting on from last week or two weeks ago, last time?

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.100
Oh, by the way, what episode number is this 163?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.700
Uh, 62, I believe.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.420
62. Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Anyway, go on.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.670
Uh, soon to be titled random bits of random randomness.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.100
Oh, that's a show. You snip that you were right. No, it is 163.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.020
God, this love being right. Anyway, tell me, tell me the story of why you're thinking about

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.940
last week and then we'll go on. No, I just thought that that so first and foremost,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.380
you know, brief retrospective number one, you starting the conversation,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.220
setting expectations with the guests. Brilliant. Brilliant.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.940
I didn't even know I did that, but I'll take it.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.550
Yeah. You, you, you basically within the first two minutes, you said,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.750
oh, and by the way, this is not going to be an interview.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:19.420
Alan proactively, like I will not hear on Twitter, uh, that, that we interviewed you wrong.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.140
Right. That, that when we did, you know, we had Anne Marie on people were mad because the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.060
interviewers talked too much. And, and obviously I didn't set their expectations

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.020
appropriately. I just wanted to get that underway. Anyway, cool.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.700
And, and, and he was cool. I think the fun guy, he's, he,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.260
if you haven't listened to one 62 yet with Kirk, go listen to it now. We'll wait.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.380
And then Alan inserts episode one 62 in the middle of episode one 63,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.180
but at double speed kind of, oh, to be inception, it'd have to be at half speed. Right.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.820
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, one of the things I was thinking about is,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.970
you know, how other podcasts are better.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:11.410
Uh, no, I, I, I've given up thinking further on that one. Other podcasts they'll do like,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:19.170
like revisit episodes where they're like, Hey, yeah, we're extra lazy today.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:26.850
So we decided that it was really important to, to play again, episode number 67.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.210
Yeah. Yeah. We don't do that. We talk about the same stuff all the time though.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.650
So we just do it differently. We just do it. We do it the extra lazy way.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.530
I'm too lazy to go find that old podcast. We'll just talk about principle five again.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.500
Any idea at all? We were just talking about.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.420
None. None whatsoever.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.380
So let's just segue right into something else.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.520
Yeah. So we just experienced some technical difficulty and we're both old. And even though

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.600
it was one minute ago, we both forgot what the hell we were talking about.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.280
And it's not worth doing playback. All right. So Alan will fix this and edit.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.450
Alan will. So let's go ahead and get, do you mind just getting into the topics for today or

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.970
the topic or we'll see how things go. Yeah. Let's go. All right, man. So we had a good question on

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.330
one of the three dots slack.com, our slack group, or you can get an invitation by going to

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:30.850
modern testing.org. We had a question in the slack group, uh, from Ryan Quill horse.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.850
Thank you, Ryan, for the question. I think it's a good topic to talk about given

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.330
sort of the current economic situation, what's happening across the industry. And also

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.170
you and I have some experience here and the questions are, and we'll repeat these, uh,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.960
later as we go through a bit. Something most of tech hasn't had to worry about until recently

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.720
is layoffs. I would like to hear, uh, Burton, Ernie's know Bernie, Alan and Brent, uh,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.480
that's us, believe it or not, our thoughts on how to lay someone off in a respectful way,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.320
how to keep a team that is still at the company focused while layoffs are happening

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.520
and stories about how past bosses have handled layoffs. And I have lots of stories here I can

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.520
share. Um, we were both around for two, at least two big, fairly big layoffs of Microsoft. And maybe

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.800
we can just kind of go back and talk through those and I can talk a little bit about

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.860
at a high level, of course, about the recent layoffs at unity. Yeah. And I, I, I don't

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:31.820
have it confirmed, but I believe there were recent layoffs at Microsoft as well. Um, I believe I don't

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:38.380
mostly impacted the sales organization. So I, I can't talk about that one. Obviously.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.460
I can't really talk about ours as well, but, but some higher level things I can. So I think the

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:51.980
first, when was it when maybe 2003 ish does sound about right. When we had those big layoffs,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:59.150
big rig, round of layoffs at Microsoft. No. When was it? I was in engineering excellence

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:04.670
when it happened. So I think I was there from, oh, no, I wasn't. It was after that. Right.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:14.300
Because I joined that Oregon 2004 or five somewhere in there. Well, there was a big round of layoffs

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:20.700
when I was in MSTV. So that might be around the timeframe. You're talking about right. Because

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:28.830
I was doing the test leadership thing. Uh, but the one, uh, where were you then? The one I'm

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:38.110
remembering was would have been around 2015. Yep. 20. Yeah. Somewhere in there. So that was actually,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.790
I want to talk a little bit more about that one because it actually has some tie-ins to modern

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:48.350
testing, but the first one I remember, and there'll be some stories to come out of here.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.950
I, it went pretty well for the most part. I, I think it's been long enough. I can talk about

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.510
this. Don't chime in if you don't need to, because I'm obviously well beyond any NDA sort of stuff.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:05.070
There were actually like, they, they took all the teams and people that were going to be laid off

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:10.190
and they grouped them. There were, you could be like a type one or a type two layoff. This

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.150
is kind of answering the first question a little bit. Um, they were choosing who to be respectful

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:21.310
to. So like the type two layoff, you were just gone with, you know, X number of severance and

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.590
like you, you're in a, in a organization that was being removed, but they didn't think you're a

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.990
great performer. Then there was kind of the type one layoff. This was their way of keeping,

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.350
I don't know if you remember this or not from the ones in 2005 ish, that's sort of the,

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:40.350
then the other one, the other type was we're going to give you, uh, access to a recruiter

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.950
and a three month severance while you find your new role at Microsoft. And it, I thought it was

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.750
pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. It was a little weird to be why am I type one or type two,

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:57.950
but I think it was usually kind of obvious. The large, large portion of the people I

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:04.590
worked with at that time were, were the higher class. And, and they basically, uh,

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:12.030
of course the problem with those ones, I didn't have any, any employees that were impacted.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:21.140
Then, but one of the problems, the problems were is, is yeah, they were, they were indicated that

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:26.820
they were laid off and they were given these resources, but a large portion of them just

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:34.270
kept doing their job. And I remember going, what are you doing, dude? What are you doing?

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:42.990
You should not like no amount of brilliant quality code check, uh, check-in is going to save you.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:49.780
Right. Only you can save you. And what are you doing? Like it was essentially, we're living in,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:57.140
in most we're living in denials. Some were, were like, uh, it was a work ethic thing. I,

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:03.300
and I honor and respect that, but when you know how many days you have to live,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.760
right? You don't go, and it's measured in, in months. You don't go back to work. Like

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:19.040
you do, you re prioritize. Anyway. So, um, I want to answer that first question, how to lay someone

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.440
off in a respectful way, because I have, of course you've seen good and bad. And I do want to talk

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.880
about the 2015 ish. I think that was when that was layoffs. So I'm reading this book and this is

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.800
going to come up with a second question as well. They recommended it to me after our recent layoffs

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.480
and the book is called healing the wounds, overcoming the trauma of layoffs and revitalizing

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.360
downsize organizations. Part of it is how to deal with being laid off, but part of it is

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:50.320
the survivor syndrome. How do you keep a morale and, uh, the feelings of anger, betrayal,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.680
et cetera, that occur after a layoff, uh, from affecting the team who are left.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.720
But we'll come back to that in a moment. Um, how would I like optimally lay somebody off?

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.440
You do a lot of explaining why in the absence of information, people will assume the worst

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.760
possible version of the truth. So if you don't give them enough information, they will just think

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.840
that you're, they could think like you're targeting them. You don't care about their

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:24.080
product, et cetera, et cetera. Uh, when you lay someone off, explain when you do a layoff,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.840
you are laying off, you're deciding not to do work. It's an early reduction in force.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.040
So if a project is canceled, the whole team is canceled, baby in the bath water and everything,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:41.340
but you explain why you explain what led to the business decision and give as much context

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:49.980
as you legally can on why your team and role were chosen to be eliminated. And then also

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:57.420
talk about next steps, talk about if they have options to look for other roles at the company,

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:03.100
how to go about doing that. And then something I got from Reed Hoffman in the Alliance is a,

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:11.630
uh, people don't work at companies forever and ever anymore. Um, they don't join a company out

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.870
of college and stay at that company until they retire. People jump around. And what Reed Hoffman

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.190
talks about is a book called the Alliance is building an Alliance. Brant, you, you work for me.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.790
I don't expect you to want to work for me forever and ever, but we're going to make,

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.110
we're going to make a one to two year commitment, an Alliance on here's what we're going to do

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.550
together. Here's what you're going to get out of it. Here's what I'm going to get out of it and be

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:39.230
very transparent. And here's how, here's what success is going to look like when that success

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:45.440
is achieved. We're good. We can decide to either re up that relationship or I can help you find

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:52.140
your next role where you can be successful. Now, when you do a layoffs as a manager, it is still

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:59.970
your role to help. Even when I fire someone for poor performance, my role is still to help them

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:05.490
find their next job where they can be successful. Doesn't mean landing them in a spot, but talking

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:13.250
to them like, let me just get back on my soapbox up here. If I'm firing someone, they aren't

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:21.890
performing in the job, but very likely they're not in the right job or they have some potentially

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:27.650
attitude or cultural problems that aren't making them successful in the role. My job as a manager

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:33.090
is not to just send them on their way, let them figure that out. I want to give them very clear

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.490
because we've had, of course, would have had the conversations ahead of time on things

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:44.290
needed to improve and I can continue to give them advice. And I will do everything I can, including

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.370
if appropriate, giving them contacts at other companies that I may know.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:56.210
I have a big slew of recruiters in my contact book. I want to help people find their next job.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.930
I fired people and had them thank me. Now, if I transfer that to laying somebody off,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.970
even more so, this is somebody who's likely not a fireable person. They would have been fired.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:11.090
They're being laid off because we had a reduction in force. I still want to take some time to give

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:16.850
them every bit of information I can to help them find their next role, either at the company that

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:22.610
we're at in a different role or to continue whatever they want to do in their mission of

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.600
growth somewhere else. And that's how I would lay someone off in a respectful way. You were

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.840
going to say something in the middle that you probably forgot it.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:39.120
Yeah. The couple of things. Oh, you were talking about two scenarios that you have discovered

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.600
where you end up needing to fire somebody. And I've actually found that it's really just one.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:56.620
And it's that person and their strengths. And I really, truly, honestly believe

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:07.180
everybody is awesome, but is or can be is is everybody is.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.340
All right. Go on. Go on. And then I'll disagree with you.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:19.970
But they are awesome in the environment that they're meant to be in. So think of it like

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:28.380
a fish is awesome. But if a fish is dropped out of a hot air balloon,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.560
right, it's going to be a little less awesome for that fish.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:45.760
Indeed. So part of part of I have had firing somebody is difficult. But I have a very strong

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:54.960
record on people thanking me for the same, same. And surprising. I've been surprised

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.840
when it started happening. But yes, I've had the same experience.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.800
I remember the first guy I ever had to fire. I was in a test role and he just simply had

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:13.520
no interest in tests. None. Every time during 101 he was talking about PM features and

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.960
customer engagement saying things like that. Couldn't get him to close anything on testing.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.930
And I said, Look, dude, here's the deal. You're not a tester. You're not a tester.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.210
You're never going to be a tester. You're not interested in the job.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:39.630
You need to go and find a job in a PM role. That is what's going to make you happy.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:48.900
And I am happy to talk to anyone you want me to talk to and recommend you for that role.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.700
But I'm going to turn down anyone who wants to come and talk to me for a test role.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:01.660
There is a matrix on this quadrant, I'll call it. But the first read about it in Michael Lop's

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:06.220
book, Managing Humans, which is very good book. And he didn't invent it. But that's where I

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.340
first read it called the skill and the will matrix. High skill, high will that by saying

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.900
is awesome. And I agree, everyone should be able to make it to that high skill, high will there.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.780
They, they rock it and they love it. Now what you're talking about is you have people that can

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:29.040
be high skill, low will. This is this person, they're in the wrong job. And you also have high

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:36.080
will low skill. There's your entry level people or new to role, new to job. I want to do this.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.000
I don't know how. And you want to make them be awesome. And then you also have the low skill,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.960
low will people who maybe are in the, in the wrong industry. There's all kinds of reasons

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.560
for that. So I think that's what you're saying. It's that skill and will everybody can get the

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.940
high skill, high will, but as a manager, it's your job to get it's the mix and match of making sure

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.460
there are skills, match what you have. But sometimes you don't have that on your team.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.140
Sometimes you don't have that at your company. And when I talk about in the Alliance is recognize

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:13.580
that and, and if needed have a frank conversation with someone say, you know, a great job for

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.020
you would be this thing. And I'm not trying to chase you out of the company, but I think

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.140
you're going to be a lot happier doing this thing. What do you want to talk about it,

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:26.300
et cetera, et cetera. But there's also what I was talking about is that assumes the person's not

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.100
an asshole. I'll make up another matrix on the spot here. Maybe it's not a matrix,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:36.620
but I'm thinking of sometimes you have people who are living the values of the company. They're,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:43.120
they're, they're, they're wonderful collaborators. They're just not producing. They're, they're not

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.920
delivering on their, they're not getting stuff done. And that's a manageable thing that requires

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.960
some coaching. Um, you can get people out of there, but also you have people who are,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.800
and just think back to nineties, Microsoft, when people got stuff done and left a wake of bodies

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.560
in the or bodies in their wake, God, I can't tell a story, but think of the person who does

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.650
really good work. And you, I know, you know, these people think back in Microsoft,

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.450
people who crank out good work, but they're an asshole and they pissed everybody off along the

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:19.490
way. Oh yeah. Yeah. So that, that's not a skill in the willow. That's a different

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:26.210
aspect of the quadrant. I don't want those jerks. I would, that's also could be a coaching issue.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.450
And I will tell you, and we've talked about it before because all my role models did that.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:37.250
I tried doing that at Microsoft for awhile and, and my Microsoft 360 from like 45 years

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:42.610
it goes over there. Cause I'm sold, but it says, well, when I sat down with HR to go over it,

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:47.170
they said, Alan, everybody loves your work, but they think you're a little bit of an asshole.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.520
I said, Oh, the first time I really thought about it, I'm just doing what all of the people around

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.640
me do. But yeah, let me, I don't, I don't enjoy it, but it's, I thought it was what I was

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.800
supposed to do. I'm new to the industry. So anyway, I tried to turn a corner sense then

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.400
and be an empathetic worker and empathetic leader. And I kind of like it better. It fits

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.920
my values more, but I want to get rid of the jerks. Go ahead.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.080
I reinforce the culture of collaboration. I too grew up in the old school Microsoft, right?

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:25.200
Right. I grew up in the, in early Microsoft, uh, in the exchange team run by Brian Valentine.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:31.280
Oh yeah. Who was there was an, there was an empathetic caring leader that Brian Valentine.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:38.800
Oh, he was funny. He was funny. Back when we had war room, not ship room, war room.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.800
What was it good for? Absolutely nothing. Say it again. War room. Good God, y'all.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:56.430
No, it was absolutely good for, you know, uh, soapboxing, um, taking off your shoes,

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:05.220
slamming it on the table to, to get your way. Right. Um, being called an asshole in that

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:13.780
organization was a badge of honor, not an insult. Well, I mentioned Nick Dimmitt here a few weeks ago.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.580
Um, Nick, I know you don't listen, but, uh, Nick once walked out of a war room meeting.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.940
Good God y'all. And kicked a hole in the wall.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:29.980
Yeah. I would, I would hope I haven't seen anything like that, but I would hope that in

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.620
today's culture at Microsoft, that would be a person that would be gone.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.060
Yeah. I think so too. It's just a different, different world. And I get that's good. That's

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.140
good. So, uh, say what you're going to say. I want to tie this back to, we're talking about how

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.020
to lay someone off in a respectful way and the tangents are part of the show. I acknowledge it.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:54.910
It's fine. So when it comes to like, when it comes to two priorities, when you say, Hey,

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:00.670
I'm going to get rid of a jerk. Okay. Um, but you may just need to coach the jerk, but,

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:08.750
but yeah, but you may get rid of the jerk. Right. So, so I used to have a policy that it's not

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:16.510
around how do you decide when to fire or lay off somebody. Um, but I used to have a policy, right.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:24.100
One of the weaknesses of having a belief that everyone is awesome is that you, uh,

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:31.380
particularly if you have a little bit of white night syndrome, you, you just keep trying and you

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:38.980
keep trying and you keep trying. And back in those days, I would try infinitely like, no,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.740
it's my fault. I just haven't communicated. It's the right way. And now I have a, uh,

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:52.720
I have since learned a three strikes and you're out. And it's basically in combination with what

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.960
I call the law of decreasing diplomacy, where the first time I communicate to the feet,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:08.560
you, the feedback, I'm going to use very soft language, very hopeful language, very diplomatic.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.480
The next time I have to talk about the same thing, I'm not going to echo exactly the same

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.240
way. Cause I'm going to, I'm going to operate under the assumption that you didn't understand

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.080
what I said last time. So I'm going to try a different way of communicating it,

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:31.520
but it's going to be a little bit more assertive. And, uh, the third time is essentially, um,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:38.320
yeah, it's time for you to find a new home one way or the other. There's multiple ways to

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.120
motivate somebody to find a new home, uh, up to and including firing.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.480
Does, does Microsoft still, I have a thought on this. I want to get back to the topic here,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.880
but, um, I had a, uh, just a thought come to me in a fleeting moment of

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.320
walking the dog or something, but does Microsoft still do PIPs performance improvement plans?

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:04.400
Uh, no, we don't, we don't have a PIP. There is another process that replaces it. That's,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.560
that's rarely used. So that's, that's one thing.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.040
It doesn't matter. It was going to be, it was, it was maybe a real over rhetorical question to

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.920
key up my, um, my thought here is, but let's say I have, and I don't have anyone like us right now.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.160
Let's here's what I thought would be a cool thing for our company to do. This is not reflect what

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.880
we're doing nor anybody else has done. I'm sure somebody does it because anytime I have an idea

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:37.120
that I think is good, it's actually been implemented by 50,000 other people. But let's say I have a

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.680
employee who's not performing. I kind of want to bring him envelope a and envelope B

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:47.040
because doing any, whether you call it a PIP or something else, any sort of, okay, we needed to

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.120
formally document your performance and help get you back on track or help you move out.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.480
That's a lot of work. It's stress on everyone. A lot of work. I want to bring, uh, envelope

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:03.760
a and envelope B envelope. A is here is your package to leave right now. Severance for a long time.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.550
You know, whatever's in the package B is, or we're going to do, we're going to do, uh, some sort of

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.550
performance improvement plan to get you back on track, do all the documentation, et cetera, et

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:22.510
cetera, et cetera. But if at the end of that, you don't get, you don't get back on track,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:29.280
you're gone with no severance. Right. It's kind of like a double or nothing. So yeah. And I think,

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.600
think about the people that we've, and again, it's, I'm not suggestion this, uh, I haven't thought

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.800
through this enough and I don't work in HR, but my thought was I was thinking through layoffs and

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.400
also help managing people out, whatever flavor of the text you want to use. And I've had two

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.600
different flavors of that. Um, often by the time it gets there, like I remember one of the

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:58.050
first ones I ever did, it was hard because I was new at it and the person, it did nothing.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:05.180
And I was thinking, man, if, if I got this message, I would just like, I would double down

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.420
work. I was young, so I'd work extra hours. I would make sure I got myself back on track,

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:15.390
but the person really didn't have any, any desire to, to fix any of the things trying to fix.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.110
But some people, I also have people who have, it's been a kick, been the kick in the butt they

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:26.020
needed. And it's like, it turned them around and they were good forever. Those are probably rarer

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.990
than the former, but they do happen. And if you had the option there, it's like, yeah,

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:36.750
I can get back on track. I go with plan B anyway, just, just a thought. I had, uh, a bunch of

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.230
thoughts came together in my head and I forgot about till right now, one to share it first time,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:45.710
freely available. But again, I'm not in HR and that would be dumb for you to think that

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:57.280
actually knew what I'm talking about. So if we can, like I kind of go back to laying off,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:05.360
uh, in a race when it comes to laying off or firing somebody, right? That's a scenario where

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:15.260
the decision's been made, right? And there I kind of fall back to, uh, have you watched the,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:21.580
my current favorite movie, which is Moneyball. Oh yeah. I've seen Moneyball a couple of times.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:32.700
Very good. I love it's yeah. Big fan. Okay. Okay. The, the scene where, uh, Brad Pitt's character

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:41.550
makes Jonah's character, uh, inform the, the party baseball player that he's being transferred

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:49.040
to another team. Do you remember that scene? No refresh me and our listeners. All right. So there

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:57.280
was, there was one of the players was always goofing off. Uh, wasn't really taking the,

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:08.750
the baseball seriously for, for the A's. So the manager made a deal and traded him. Okay. And,

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:16.590
uh, in that example, it was very similar to like a fire or layoff and the manager gave it to

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:24.030
his name's Jonah, right? Jonah, Jonas, one of those anyway, Jonah Hill. Yeah. It gave it to

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:31.810
Jonah Hill's character to do the actual, uh, notification that he's being traded. Okay.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.380
And he's like, he was stressing out about that. He was like, okay, this guy just bought a house.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:47.500
He's got all this headache. Right. And Brad Pitt's character said something I think is very smart.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:31:00.610
Right. When the decision is gone, don't drag it out. It's like, Alan, if you knew that you were going

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:06.770
to die tomorrow, you had no choice. You're going to die tomorrow. There's nothing you can do about

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:14.370
it. The only thing you can choose is, do you want a bullet to the head or five bullets to the stomach

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:25.360
and bleed to death choice? Absolutely. Right. And that's kind of my view on layoffs, right? It's,

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:33.840
oh yeah. Yeah. It's, you got to get to the point. You can't do false hope. No, no, no, no. You,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:41.140
you, you got to make it absolutely clear. This is happening. Nothing you can do about it.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:50.020
Here is all the other additional information. Good luck. Right. And that additional information is

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.460
important. All that. Why? So I want to, so I think we're in violent agreement there. I mean,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.820
there's just the worst way you can do it is to just hand him a piece of paper and walk away

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.700
or, or when I was laid off from Chuck E. Cheese's when I was 16 years old,

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:13.550
just stop scheduling me for work. I've had that. I've, I've had that as well.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:19.950
So I want to talk about the second one. The first one's kind of the last question was stories

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.670
about how past bosses have handled layoffs. I think I kind of weave those in indirectly into

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.350
the first answer, but I do want to talk about how to keep the team that is still at the

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:34.910
company focused while layoffs are happening because it's always been tough. There is survivor

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:39.550
syndrome and that book I recommended earlier in the podcast talks about this a lot. It's

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:45.310
hard on people. They, they feel like their families cut out and there's a great story from the book.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:50.270
It says, imagine you're a family of six, four kids. And one day you come down to dinner and, and

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:57.630
the father and mother say, it looks like we're not going to be able to continue to have six

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:04.620
people. We're going to have to make do some downsizing. So, uh, you two pointed to the kids,

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.700
you are going to be living with your aunt and uncle and be no longer part of this family.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.220
I'm going to need you to have your bags packed and ready to go this evening. And the rest of

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.640
us continue. Then they're gone. They're in shock. And then the next night at dinner,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.680
there's only four, four people sat there. They kind of act like it. You kind of ignore the

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.040
big elephant in the room and they say, well, as you know, there's only four of us now.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.360
So we're all going to have to do a little extra work in order to make sure that we can continue

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.840
to have the same quality life we have before. And it's like awkward, weird, uh, not the right way

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:46.000
to do it. So keeping the key, keeping the team focused. So what I've done, uh, is just a whole

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.520
lot of transparency. I tell you what, man, I have learned so much about being a manager

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.500
by going to a therapist. If you want to be a good leader, go get some therapy because you learn

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:02.420
I mean, lots of little tips on listening and empathizing that are really powerful,

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:08.660
but just let people vent, let people vent respectfully, let them feel like they're heard.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:15.060
Actually that sounds condescending. Listen to them so they feel like they're heard. Don't make them,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.740
don't just make them feel like they're heard. Actually listen to them. Let them know they're

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:25.540
heard. Do what you can to support answer their questions the best you can, uh, acknowledge

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.540
that it's hard with fewer people. Now we didn't have layoffs in my team, but we did have a lot of

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.820
open headcount cut. So we have some teams that are thinner. Um, we just managed to do it without

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:43.380
laying, laying people off and it's hard. So just, you just acknowledge it and listen and, uh,

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.220
remind them what's important. That's okay. If things are delivered slower now, because that's,

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:54.660
that's the way you talk about calendar time is the one thing. I mean, we can't lay it off.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.260
We can't change it. It's just stuck. There's only so much we can get done in a certain

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:03.460
amount of time with a certain amount of people dedicated to an effort, but it's all just to me.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:11.710
It's massive transparency and empathy. Yeah. And you got to be careful with the empathy

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:21.140
in some regards as well. It depends on the situation, right? How do I put this?

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.940
There's a, there's a point in there somewhere. I'm waiting for it.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:36.060
Yeah. No, the, the, you have to think of it as, or you don't have to. I mean, I do. So I think of it as,

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.700
I don't know. You probably know the author of this, this, the storming, forming, norming, uh,

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:47.550
philosophy around. I'm familiar with it. I can't remember who wrote it.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:54.030
Okay. Yeah. So whatever your big thing like this happens, I just offered in the assumption

00:35:54.990 --> 00:36:00.030
that, that we now need to rebuild our team identity.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:06.670
Well, it, it, it depends. I guess. Then there's other questions. I remember,

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:12.830
I don't remember which one of these, which one of the layoffs we talked about. Okay. But, uh,

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:25.900
oftentimes the criteria around the layoffs, um, are, are, are driven by legal, not by managers.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:33.420
And that's one thing I think, well, I think a lot of employees I've talked to were surprised by.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:40.780
It's like a lot of the layoffs, um, managers often find out within hours before the employee does.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:51.230
Right. And it's because it has to pass a legal standard of fairness.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:58.130
And also it, you, it helps contain any sort of leakage of that information.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:04.450
That is true. But I don't, I don't think that's the primary cause. Like with things like,

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:08.290
regardless of things like blind today, that doesn't happen.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:14.130
So let's look at my interpretation of the question. It's not like during the layoff. So the,

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:21.330
so the question does say while they're happening, but generally the guidance on layoffs from all the,

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:26.370
the business books on this are cut once cut deep, don't do a little bit and then a little more,

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:32.210
a little more, that just creates so much anxiety on the team. Do one, do one and get it over with.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:38.050
So, and then you're not focusing on when's the next wave, who's next. And I think

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:43.410
Microsoft especially, I think the two layoffs we were part of, uh, both just happened in one

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:48.160
fell swoop with that first one being a little bit different with the different tiers, but

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.160
people weren't wondering, okay, now that layoffs have happened, will there be another round that

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.820
affects me? You don't want people working that way. Now it is completely true, but

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:05.740
you can only do anything if you're part of the decision committee for around how to roll out the

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:10.460
layoff. Yeah, but I'm completely agree a bullet to the head is better than five. And there's a

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:15.660
lot we don't have control over, but what we do have control over is after the layoffs have happened

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:23.940
and you have everybody else who has survived is how do you help those people with their shock,

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.900
their anger, their betrayal. And for that transparency, as much as you can legally,

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:35.700
or as much as you know, and empathy, just listen to them because it's okay to be angry or mad

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:40.900
or frustrated or betrayed, or have any sort of emotions you want about the thing that just

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:47.140
happened that took some of your coworkers away from your company. That's it's okay to have

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:53.700
those feelings. And as a leader, as a manager and keeping that team focused, the telling them to

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.900
ignore it and move on is, is going to cause bigger problems. The best thing you can do

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:06.030
to get the team less distracted about that and continue to deliver on the things they need to

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:13.090
is listen to them, empathize with them. This is where I want empathy. It's like, yes,

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.490
it is frustrating. Totally get it. I would be frustrated if I were you. It's, it's hard to

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:22.930
get stuff done. And here's what I can tell you on why that's happened. Again, there's a transparency

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:36.860
rinse, lather, repeat. Genuinely listening is absolutely important. Genuinely being genuine

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.260
and listening. That is absolutely critical. I think about the last time people wanted to

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:47.580
come and talk to me and not like, this was so unfair. Even the ones that survived. They're like,

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:57.580
and even managers. Okay. I know of a story where one guy who just got promoted, literally

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:08.430
a month out of the promoted, they got laid off. And another guy was on track to being fired.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:14.510
And he survived. And the manager was like, whoa, whoa. And there was one manager that

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:22.350
owned these two people. Like once he heard about it, he immediately went into high gear,

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:28.750
super, super high achievers stuff, like email, email, call, call, call, trying to get, no, no,

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:37.440
before this announced swap. And he couldn't because the decision has been made.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:44.080
Also, I don't like that. I don't like the idea of laying, like you lay off the team, the,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.840
not the team, the project, you cancel projects, not it's weird. I know Microsoft has done this

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.400
when I come, I want to get back to one other topic before we end here, but it's odd to me

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.960
and really hard if you're laying off individual people from a team and not other people from that

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:09.600
team. So it's weird. One thing I want to quickly talk about is that those 2014 or 15 layoffs,

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:16.880
those happened when I was on my sabbatical in the South of France. And this was, I knew it was

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:23.200
coming because we did this exercise. Yeah. Anytime you're filling out a spreadsheet that

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:32.800
talks about what people do, you know, someone's looking for redundancy, et cetera. And that was the

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:39.040
one where modern testing was accelerated at Microsoft because that's one that removed a lot

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.940
of the S debt rolls that hadn't already moved into several. If I recall correctly,

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:53.230
Brent's nodding his head. I did my own versions of those spreadsheets as well. It was, it was

00:41:53.230 --> 00:42:07.020
more around. So we had some management in, in that layoff, we had about a week, basically like this is

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:19.860
happening. You have a week to you, the management team, the frontline management team. These, these

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:26.960
are the people who are surviving the layoff and you have a week to figure out their new role.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:39.580
Right. So for example, I was put in charge. So he, he was a former test manager

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:50.160
and in one fell swoop, he was being moved to a dev IC role. And it was, this guy didn't report

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:58.560
to me, but it did fall on me to figure out where he goes. And you had to close that in a week

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:07.550
because you had, because they, when they announced the layoffs, everything had to be buttoned up.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.080
Well, everything was supposed to be buttoned up. I think about, I think back on it now, I'm like,

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.480
did it really, could they have, could they not announce it? And then this told us this,

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.400
or is that, is that, you know, a second bullet to the stomach?

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:28.720
So when I took, I took almost actually a full three months off, um, two of it in maybe,

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.480
where was I? Maybe two and a half in France, another two weeks in Japan on the way home,

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.600
ended up going all around the world on that trip. So he went east to France, stayed there

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.840
for a long time and then stopped, stopped in Japan on the way home, also flying east. So

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:49.600
made it all the way around the world. But I remember what I, I, I didn't work at all,

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.710
but I deleted a bunch of emails. I didn't want to come back to 10,000 unread email. And that

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:59.630
is not an exaggeration because Microsoft, I don't know if it's any different with teams,

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.870
but a very email culture, everything communicated over email.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:09.950
Oh, it's, you know what I don't, it is different with teams, but now it's,

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:20.930
it's everything is communicated in, in teams or email. And I find I find I'm like, okay, I know

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:28.290
this person sent me this information, but how I can't find it. So with us conversation, I mean,

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:31.650
it's, it's the way it should work. And it's great. I'll get back to my story in a second here.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:38.980
Conversation is in Slack. Information sharing is an email. I also get all my, you know,

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:44.260
approve X approve Y signed this contract, et cetera. So anyway, I'm in the South of France. It's,

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.260
it's afternoon, you know, eight hours ahead of the time, I think. And I'm chucking down my second

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:56.100
glass of Rose and having a, having a baguette with some cheese. And I get a high-pri message

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:02.990
from Chris, my boss, acknowledging that I'm, I'm not working, but he said, Hey, just want to

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.740
let you know. And I didn't even check that I hadn't read the news or anything. He goes,

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:14.320
just want you to know your job safe. And it was funny. I had like, if I saw a message like that,

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.080
today, I wouldn't care either. But a lot of times when I cry, I go, Oh my God, what happened? But

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:25.040
I was like, I don't care. You can, I don't care if it is or not. I'm in the South of France,

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.840
sitting on the back patio with a glass with a bottle of Rose and this baguette. I'm,

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.560
I'm actually all right, man, whatever you want to do. But, uh, apparently they had just done

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:42.080
a bunch of layoffs and a bunch of good people we work with on Xbox. Uh, after Xbox one shipped,

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.920
of course, Xbox, uh, is based on, um, the windows operating system, uh, a couple of different

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:53.840
flavors of it. It's three different OSs. That's a whole different story. That redundancy list was

00:45:53.840 --> 00:46:01.230
as they made Xbox and windows more one group was finding redundancy and who did what. So

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:06.750
it was kind of a bummer and I felt the same way. And I probably would have felt worse if I was there

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:12.030
and not in the South of France, but a lot of people that I really liked and people I hung out with and,

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:17.070
and who were really good and they were just gone. So it's always tough. Anyway, that was,

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:22.910
that was my story, but it accelerated modern testing because, uh, teams had to figure out

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:28.590
how to get testing done. And some, just like we've talked about a million times on this podcast,

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:36.750
drink a million times, some teams did it well and had that growth mindset, not a testing mindset,

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:43.490
and embraced it and got really good at delivering quality. And some people, some teams didn't.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:48.770
I'm kind of curious. I don't know that we talked about it.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.330
Talked about what?

00:46:52.130 --> 00:47:05.010
Well, so you and I had different experiences in our times in, in, uh, Xbox. Right. And I

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:17.540
look at it and I was like, wow. Um, well, okay. We had different experiences in our time in Xboxes.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:26.500
So it's the Xbox's culture claimed to be agile. And I'm like, no, no, they were, they were not.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:34.740
They were, to use your term, like they, my experience of Xbox was the epitome of fragile.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:45.820
Um, when I was there, like the epitome and I, and I don't recall, I don't recall the

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:52.700
conversations when they shifted away from no test or were you there during that time?

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.440
Remember, yes, because, um, a couple of things happened. Okay. So I tell part of my story here. So,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.080
um, everybody, I mean, windows became this huge division still siloed a little bit,

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:14.750
um, meaning separate a functional org, but instead of a testing org, part of the reason I didn't like

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:19.710
the windows or good all because Michael Fortin who was leading that group, I thought was just a

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:28.420
bumbling idiot and still due to this day. But remember it became a, uh, data science and

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:33.940
telemetry org. Do you remember that sort of shift? And that's where I, I was working for Chris. I

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:41.460
working for Chris on the stupid science project. And I briefly led our air quote data science

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:45.940
and telemetry team and a lot of, a lot of tests, like, no, Steve Roe moved in there. Just,

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:51.300
I think he's a better fit in that org than he was in the test org. So we have examples like that.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:56.660
Steve Roe member, honorary member of the AB testing podcast. I've been on the show a couple

00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:05.540
of times and, uh, yeah. So that's, that's how that shift happened. Um, in our case,

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.140
I think there was some testers around still. I can't quite remember trying to get developers

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:15.140
to own testing. I'm not sure what happened after that. Uh, but one cool thing I did then,

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.940
or one fun thing was there is a little bit of a consortium of all these different

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:24.980
managers of these new data science teams. And we get together once a week and it was a

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:31.540
huge cluster fudge. Uh, remember Steve Roe being there and other people, I don't remember being

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:39.170
there and conversations like it was really, it was the wrong, they wanted to replace their test

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:45.740
past dashboards with a telemetry dashboard. They, it was, they were thinking it was just wrong.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:54.900
And, uh, they were trying, but it was just so bad. And this is where, oh gosh, I did,

00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:02.660
I put together and taught a seminar to, or, or class to windows developers. What were those

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:12.300
things called? Um, shoot scenarios and measures or something. Some, some, it was, yeah, I like

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:21.260
yeah, there was some real awkward to bad attempts by the brightest and the best there to, uh,

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:26.780
try and figure out how to do telemetry and data. And I'm glad, um, which was weird because a lot

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:32.220
of orgs at Microsoft, even then we're doing it very, very well. It's just windows was behind the

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:37.420
times and trying to figure it out. But, um, anyway, all that stuff was happening, but yeah,

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:41.420
I did that for a while and got really, really bored. And then went to teams where I just got

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:47.100
really, really bad. Yeah. And you made me think about somebody who I haven't thought about in a

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:58.180
while. Um, I had a meeting with their manager about a year ago. No, no, that's a lie. It was

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:06.660
probably a year, a year before COVID. So that was much longer ago. Um, but, uh, I'm not mentioning

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:15.280
last name on purpose, but Chris is no longer at Microsoft. Oh, he had been working in an IC

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:24.780
data science role and I'm seeing him up on LinkedIn. He's taking a break exploring and

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:31.820
learning is what it says. He can, he can go to forward along with Nick and Ken. All right. Anyway,

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.140
somewhere in there, talked about layoffs. You get the extra stories too, because tangents are part

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:41.420
of what you get on the Paul and Bernie show Bert, Bert, Bert, Bert, I don't know.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:47.600
Bert, Bernie, Bert, Bernie, Bert, Bernie Spears,

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:51.870
Bert, Bernie, Bernie, there's your name.

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:52.750
Bernie. Spears.

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:58.910
Spears are awesome. All right. Okay. Everybody we're at a time where way out of time, except

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:03.630
when I edit this and get out of Brent remove all Brent's screw ups and coughing in the time where

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:08.350
he clicked his pen in the middle of him talking. Uh, but yep, there goes again. Oh my God.

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.780
All right. Anyway, edit this. I'm still not Paul.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:21.120
And I might be, we're a train wreck. Welcome to the train wreck podcast. We'll see you next time.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.750
Bye.
