00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.420
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.260
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.580
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show welcome to dance party you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.020
know it's the AB testing podcast hey everyone I'm Alan I'm Brent and this is

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.200
144 yes episode 144 not just a random number which is a perfect score of 12

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.220
by the way I tend to prefer our prime number podcasts when's the next one I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:52.380
don't know what no 20 no 147 49 might be how's it how's the the new gig well it's

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.940
the same gig with the new boss and my org is growing I have yeah there's a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.020
unannounced reargue coming so I won't give the details on that but that'll put my

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.480
org at about including open headcount about 130 140 somewhere in there Wow so

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.940
my dog is joining the podcast everyone say hi to Tara Tara say hello hi Tara

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.740
she can't hear you you're in there my headphones but it should make her

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.460
wookiee sound here in a second it's going pretty well I like it works fun

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.180
it's just an easy place to do good work as I've said many times so yeah

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.980
work is good how are things going on your end work is work where we're in a phase

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:45.860
where I don't know so right now there's a high urgency thing asked from the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.170
senior VP and it results in me spending a lot of my time building yet another

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.250
dashboard and as you know that type of work really excites me yep yeah yeah yeah

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.530
yeah I am I tried I play the hands when somebody's told me to build a dashboard

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.100
I play the hands over my ears la la la la can't hear you game that works well

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.260
for me I'm not sure what happens you know well for you yeah no so in this

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.410
particular case I actually so the last time I said yes to this ask it was a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.970
big massive learning lesson I told my manager no I am NOT doing this again and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.840
this time around I had I had my staff come in and have them work on it but one

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.160
of my peers is going on paternity leave and one of the things that I do pride

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:54.620
myself on is I am good at training up people to be on the bench and so the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.900
person that I had targeted to to basically be the leader for this project

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.660
that is not me was also on the bench and so she is now going to be while he's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.460
out on paternity she is going to be the acting manager of that team which I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.100
think is a fantastic opportunity and experience for her but it now puts me in

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:27.450
the position of oh I have to be the IC for the stupid dashboard so you bring up

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.130
one thing I was gonna push us along to the topic but this idea as a leader in

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.190
building a bench and it's a term that's not every company uses it but I've heard

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.390
it enough to know it's used pretty often it's this who is the level of

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.310
leadership that is gonna take over for you when you leave move on to something

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.190
else etc right and I've been working a lot on that I have a fairly junior team

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.190
where I now have with a recent promotion I have one manager within two

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.710
levels of me right now and working on getting everyone else where they need to

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.510
be with the way you have one manager in an organization of a hundred no no no

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.430
I have one that's within most both all of the rest of them are three levels

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.620
below me latter level wise one is two levels below me I am trying to grow my

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.420
org so right now there's no one if I disappear if I decide I want to go farm

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.900
clams in would be island there is no one in my org that can take over for me

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.580
as my org is planned to continue to grow throughout this year I have now

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.340
one person who can take on a lot more leadership and some that are getting

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.100
there but I'm spending a lot of time trying to groom my bench going back to

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.300
the term of the bench again to get more people on my team capable and ready to

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.930
take on larger more strategic roles yeah yeah I forgot I there was a reorg we

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.070
had a lot of reorgues I actually have two two of my managers are within two

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.260
levels of me but I don't I don't I'm not I put it this way I'm I do not have a

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.580
good bench right now it's on my mind it's something I work on with my HR

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.780
business partner as far as planning goes quite a bit to make sure we're moving in

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.980
that direction when you say in within two levels of you do you mean lateral

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.340
or yeah hierarchical I mean latter levels okay got it got it and and those I just

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.620
want to I'll keep them abstract but it's you know similar to Microsoft is a

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.860
level of scope and responsibility that people typically can cover as they grow

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.420
through latter levels and you know I could solve the problem I'll just promote

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.460
them but they're not already to handle the scope of that work so I'm working on

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:57.780
that right right that's that's one thing that I I view very seriously with with

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:05.150
promoting folks one cool anecdote to share I don't spend long talking about but we

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.910
could actually if I could change the topic we could do a whole podcast on

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.670
growing your team when I left Microsoft and we're gonna have a longer topic on

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.940
this a little bit I recall my last several years there as teams began to

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.900
flatten there were far fewer lead positions and there were people who had

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.480
been leads or wanted to be leads it was very difficult to get into a lead

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.170
position I don't know if that's still the case or not no it's not it's not in

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.680
some regards and I forget the chronology but you were you were there for both

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.920
events and one was right when we got when we we moved tests to different

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.120
disciplines and then there was another where and not all teams did this but

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.080
it was in general with them within Microsoft like a general flattening of

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.560
organizations yeah what I recall I'm just finished my thought and you go on

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.720
with yours but whatever call is that when that flattening happened there are a lot

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.720
of leads who either moved to I see positions or what remember when there was

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.560
an opening for a lead position there would be a hundred applicants and just

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.800
the thought I was gonna say is right where I'm at now I actually have lead

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.440
positions that I can't get anyone to want to I was I am short a few leads

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.160
on my team across across the organization and I am going to have to

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.480
probably internal transfer or higher externally which is I hate I don't hate

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.480
doing for a lead it's difficult to do for a lead I think but I have to figure

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.320
something out because I'm short a couple leads and all of my IC's are like no man

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.680
I don't want to be a lead I love being an IC but go ahead and continue your

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.010
chronology sir about Microsoft well I was gonna say there was a time where we

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:53.450
kind of flattened the the organization as a whole within Microsoft I remember not

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.250
all teams did this but it was still sort of a general practice and I would

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:09.350
say things are sort of naturally kind of going back to the way it was like they're

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:15.150
heading back so in other words we probably over over flattened and in the

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:22.190
in the do-ness of time things have become a little bit more hierarchical as things

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.830
happen I don't think it's problematic at this point in time like back in the day

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:36.950
right a manager with two directs was super freakin common yeah it's it's it

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:44.230
happens it's but it's not common now back in the day someone in the senior

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:50.740
band might be a manager or that was super common it's not common today but it does

00:08:50.740 --> 00:09:02.080
happen the 20 20 years ago someone far from senior could be a lead yeah yeah

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:09.530
actually is the wild wild west all right so anyway that's interesting grow your

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:15.280
bench and find good leads and take care of them because they're good people I

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.120
have two topics for the day one was a cliffhanger from our last episode if you

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:28.550
want to go back and check it out you can do that but the story was I was asked

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:36.150
to give an AMA at test bash home if you are a Ministry of testing pro subscriber

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.350
you can go watch that recording right now and the wonderful Tristan asked me

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:47.920
questions about the feature of test automation I think they asked me to

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.680
give this talk knowing I would be at least somewhat controversial and I came

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.920
up with three bullet points that we discussed and each designed to it in

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.800
combination the three of them together the van was designed to piss off the

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:16.850
most possible people unfortunately because the audience was so mature and

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.530
had actual proper critical thinking it just made him think about stuff and ask

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.490
good questions but the idea was there so I don't know if I should give you

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.530
them to you one at a time or go through all three maybe I'll do one at

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.690
a time because knowing you you'll want to comment and off the real you back

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:41.920
in so the first one is I have forgotten no the first one is in the future

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.540
developers will do the vast majority of all test automation okay and I was

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.860
trying to find in looking I was trying to see if someone wrote down what these

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.780
were because I I just scribbled it on a piece of paper somewhere as test bash

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.590
was approaching but I can actually find myself saying this as far back as 2016

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.310
so I don't think anything super controversial or something you hadn't

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.990
heard before actually none of these are things you hadn't heard before so that's

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:17.350
number one any worries about that as a prediction like the only thing I could

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:23.910
say that would cause it to fall apart is perhaps underestimating the the

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.270
strength of test automators white knuckles holding on to the past this

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.550
is actually my worry because there are leagues and leagues of teams who do our

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:39.070
test automation specialists yeah and that's what they do they don't want to

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:47.120
do anything else they make their money making so but I think it's right I think

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.520
it's in and for all the reasons we talked about in modern testing on this

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.840
podcast it's inefficient once developers write the code write the test for the

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.640
code they end up writing better design code because they end up writing more

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.360
testable code all these things happen lots of good things happen developers

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.680
own test automation they end up automating a lot of the right things and

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:15.090
they do a good job yeah I think actually one of the one of the things that is

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.930
sort of what's the opposite of a prediction the one of the things that

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:26.690
benefiting the opposite of your prediction is that literally everyone

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:34.170
that I have talked to and we even when we had that conversation with those folks

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:39.960
a couple of podcasts ago right I'm forgetting their name the the company

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.040
name at the moment where where they're providing test automation services reflect

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:50.280
on run thank you reflect that run right one of the things that is I think

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:58.200
slowing this down is the fact that not a lot of people are still currently aware

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.920
around around the the current studies and science on this one no no because they

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.600
like to just you know we live in our bubble they live in their bubble yeah a

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.880
so anyway I'm not surprising you there too but you can imagine you can

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.160
imagine that would push some buttons the second one again is nothing you

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.760
picking a reflect dot run nothing you haven't heard before I think record and

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.240
playback low code whatever you want to call them tools like reflect dot run

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.920
test and Mabel etc they will be the de facto standard for test automation I

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.230
think in the future handcrafted tests in Selenium sorry Jason I love you but

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:47.000
you're not the future handcrafted tests go away and record and playback was a

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.880
de facto for UA automation there's still actually you will use Selenium for some

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.240
special cases when you want to do a special maybe it's a stress scenario

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.080
maybe it's a smart monkey test there are some things that it will probably do

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.770
better when you want to handcraft your test but this idea of armies of sorry

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:13.050
not armies this idea of a mass of web tests written in Selenium running as

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:20.120
your product is going away those two together mean that developers will be

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.400
using these record they know how to code which is great they also know how to be

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.240
efficient and I would say in the future a developer quickly creates a record and

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.840
playback test for the UI they've done game over that's that's the way UI

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.440
testing is done and the way test wait UI test automation I'm sorry is done in the

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:48.240
future yeah yeah and I think it's influenced once business leaders

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:56.470
recognize the outcomes that we're recognizing and I think they'll shift

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:04.570
over right it's essentially what so what holds it back number one developers don't

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:12.090
want to do it number two test you know small armies of test automation

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:20.610
engineers obviously don't want to have their job at risk right number three

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:26.410
business leaders aren't actually really aware of the benefits so if business

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:32.170
leader once they're aware of the benefits right whether it be dev or test they're

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:37.730
both gonna kind of both dev and test and a lot of businesses are gonna push back

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:44.480
on this that's that's what's gonna slow it down at least from my experience you

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:53.480
need to have leaders that I don't know the way I would never mind I'm all right

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.560
I'm blocking my own tangent so the last one can try this one a little bit

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.240
because I know one way to trigger a lot of people is bring up the test

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:10.120
automation pyramid because I don't know why I like to push buttons and what I

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.120
said was because of the first two when the when we have a world where

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.120
developers are doing the vast majority of automation and the UI automation is done

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:24.400
via record and playback the benefits from that actually make the test

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.040
automation distribution just test automation pyramid true in nearly every

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:37.560
case wait wait wait so that's automation pyramid because of one and two test

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:44.070
automation pyramid becomes true yes where I think a lot of people this was back to

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.550
my comment I've said many times where people look at the test automation

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:53.150
pyramid and they think it's dumb to try and make their tests fit that ratio and

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.990
they're right and my viewpoint has always been that the test automation

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.350
pyramid is a reflection of what happens when you have well-designed code and I

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.350
think you'll get more of that as developers own more stuff and have an

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.790
easy way to do their UA automation you're gonna you're gonna see the

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:15.200
pyramid actually happen and nobody will care and this is the problem right now

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.360
people care too much about the pyramid no but it's not always right and

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.870
sometimes you want the ice cream cone and sometimes shut up stop your warning

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:28.510
it's a model all models are wrong some are useful everything about it makes

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:36.390
sense just stop getting your arms all caught up there slim buckety so let me

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:43.020
first thing when we're talking about when we're talking about the test

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.500
automation pyramid correct we're talking about one where there's edb

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:54.620
number of tests at the UI layer there's you know right more at the business layer

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.300
and then way way way way more of the unit test layer right that's what we're

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:06.280
talking about right so if Dev owns everything and record and playback is

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:16.000
done through the UI you then think unit tests will become dominant and the UI

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:22.760
will be I think you're overthinking this Brent and no no I'm trying to decide if

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.920
I agree with your thing and what I'm you're right I may be overthinking but

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:32.960
obviously what we see so if if record and playback becomes wildly successful

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.520
because of well let me phrase it differently I think those who argue with

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.400
the test automation pyramid most of the stem of their arguments come from the

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.120
fact that test rather than dev attempts to own the vast majority of test

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.840
automation I think if and when developers own automation regardless of

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.320
the children regardless of a second one when developers own automation it is much

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.080
more apt and I would say almost guaranteed that the tests fall into a

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.400
distribution as described by the test pyramid yeah I'm just wondering to what

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:19.580
degree the service layer like I actually wonder in your thing if you know

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.990
the quote-unquote middle class disappears because it's really the thing there's

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:31.840
there's not if the pyramid puts those nice lines between things it's test get

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.680
more granular less granular depending on where you're going there's a fuzzy line

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.120
between things you call unit tests and things you call functional tests and even

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.320
things you call UI tests or end-to-end tests yeah the the only issue is is that

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:55.890
I actually see you know UI tests you know taking over if it ends up being that

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:04.370
easy and you know fixing shit through through ML supported methods right ends up

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:12.320
being that easy then I could easily see the the business rule automation sort of

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:19.000
disappearing unit tests thing because of how fast it is and things along those

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.800
lines I kind of I feel like I agree with you that that would be at the bottom but

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.720
I'm wondering if the pyramid becomes a square I don't think so I think and

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.640
I'll say this again for those who have heard me say this I think today due to

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:42.480
ownership and the popularity and nothing again love you Jason nothing against

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:49.600
Selenium I think the industry has an unhealthy infatuation with UI automation

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:59.030
and I think the in the future that goes away explain that in the context of

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:07.760
your principle number two today with test owning writing the UI automation and

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.040
loving loving loving Selenium and having it being a separate team often not even

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.120
connected or talking with the dev team agree right thousands and hundreds of

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:25.480
thousands of lines of Selenium code to execute the UI of their application it

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.480
takes a long time those tests are can be flaky when selectors changes lots of

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.600
stuff you can do around that to make those more resilient but still they are

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.840
flaky and it takes a lot of time to build and maintain those tests I'm saying

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.520
in the future it's going to be much more efficient to just record and

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.280
playback that test and if the test ever can't handle those tests again

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.400
with the right tools those record and playback tests will automatically adapt

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.080
to changes in your underlying selectors layout etc if it ever gets to a point

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.160
where your test just the tool can't keep up with the overall you made to your

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.680
website I think it's still faster just to go rerecord that test than it

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.760
would ever have been to continue to handcraft and maintain those tests over

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.520
time I now understand where we we where you and I where I was having

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.200
difficulty getting to the same page in your book and it was essentially because

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.520
you talk about UI automation and in all of that discussion that synonymous with

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.560
with handcrafted UI automation right to me recording playback is still UI

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.720
automation it is I did not mean to imply otherwise right but the value proposition

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:50.200
of having a whole team whose job it is to spend 50% of their time taking

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.920
yesterday's flaky tests and turning them into tomorrow's different flaky tests

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.640
right that shit goes away I think that the tools today are very resilient to

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.240
change in underlying code and that's what's been missing and again we came

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.600
from a world you and I hear record and playback we automatically think nope way

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.320
too flaky for use the world's changed in the web world at least stuff got

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.560
better anyway that's it I do want to get to the other topic today which I think

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.400
is gonna require some discussion so that's sort of a recap I encourage you

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.600
who are pro members to go to the ministry testing site and check out that

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.200
talk it's very I had a good time lots of good feedback and I'm surprised given

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.200
the at my attempt at controversy which kind of failed that it was still fun I

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.800
at least got some people to think which is always what we strive for and

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.120
maybe testing and so I try and take that stuff elsewhere so did you get any push

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:55.120
back on not really not really there are some tangential questions around well

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.480
should testers still learn to code and of course I think yes and I think it's a

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.160
lot of things that could do that aren't writing test automation there's

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.760
lots of tooling and even doing some testing that isn't necessarily driving

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.280
the UI but no real pushback no real pushback people there's stuff like

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.120
people didn't really believe me like oh yeah I could see why you think that but

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.220
that won't work in my world a lot of the snowflake stuff you overtime what

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.420
happens I could be wrong but it's a world where I think it's a better world the

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.460
future I described is it is it is achievable it's what Steven Johnson

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.660
calls the adjacent possible it's right there we just need teams to start

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.660
doing it and I have found I also discovered not just teams I've worked

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.300
with here at Unity but I have now found other team for the development

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.500
teams are more and more like when we first talked about modern testing team say oh

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.940
hey we're doing that I am finding development teams who are using record

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.660
and playback tools for the UI automation so it's it's happening just not

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:57.020
widespread yet I think it's gonna be big we had a subject change not really a

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.260
mailbag question but a good inquisitive question on the slack

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.820
channel today it's something I've been asked before and worth talking about if

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.420
you can recall way back remember the you don't remember it but the listeners

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:15.420
are three listeners may remember we did a podcast once without Brent I invited I

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:21.980
invited all three to join me in this small room kind of off behind the seats

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:27.900
in the room where we had a test bash Philly in 2016 I was at Microsoft

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:33.580
working on Microsoft Teams and I gave a talk on testing without testers sort of

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:41.020
the beginning of how I have been working with teams to on quality coaching we

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.820
took we have previous podcast or talked about that will rehash a little bit of

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.940
that but they asked a very good question they say Alan I'm gonna I'm gonna for

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.260
Raghu on it's like I'm gonna summarize this whole thing to something I've heard

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.880
before so you're pretty passionate about modern testing and not having dedicated

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.680
testers and test coaching and you worked on teams but with all that said

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.760
you worked on teams Microsoft Teams and Brett don't say anything you'd stop in

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:16.120
trouble but they say but Microsoft Teams really really sucks so what happened is

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:21.840
it did you really are you are you not walking the talk or whatever again I'll

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.920
do most of talking to your Brett in case you know your boss is ever listening I

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.440
like like honestly I can't imagine Microsoft you can't badmouth our

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.480
product every single Microsoft product is excellent and you need to tout our

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:46.780
awesomeness no so there will be no teams bashing for me today I I do think it has

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:53.890
I mean it has it has wads but generally generally a lot of those wads can be

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:59.650
traced that sometimes can be traced back to two things that I have a very

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:05.330
particular interest there will be none of that today but as it relates to what

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:11.450
the hell Alan you you hypocrite I'm all aboard on that conversation okay so let

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.770
me talk let me just rehash a little bit those haven't been on the podcast for a

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.810
long time we talked about it when I was there on the podcast I don't

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:22.090
remember numbers back in the 60s or 70s it's been a while not episode

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:28.290
numbers not years so I joined teams as an individual contributor to they were

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:33.410
very early on they were about 75 developers maybe all up at the time maybe

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:39.840
less maybe 50 I can't quite remember but they wanted someone to come in and

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.040
help the team think more about quality they did not having dedicated testers they

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.740
had some former testers working on infrastructure here and there but they

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.580
didn't really have anyone helping the team think about testing I joined the

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:58.000
team and they had a pretty good suite of unit tests in place and some other tests

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.390
which weren't very good they did as I've described elsewhere all the testing they

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.150
knew how to do and they put some effort into it it wasn't great but it

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:13.140
wasn't horrible so that's where I started and I joined the team and I did

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:20.280
some stuff kind of like a test manager would for the team I just I made sure

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.880
bug tracking was in place and we had some bug metrics boring but worth

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.080
tracking for tech debt I did some communication around quality and just kind

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.680
of set the team up a little bit with the quality culture maybe some of my first

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.320
thinking that in develop the quality culture guide till a couple years later

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.760
but at least stuff that was in my head way more years later yeah so one

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.440
thing I realized there so I did a couple times I did a bug bash kind of

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.720
thing let's take two hours today or a half a day today and we'll all do a bunch

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.490
of testing on the project and I would they mostly did it in teams like small

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.890
little teams getting together to work on things and I would roam fairly small

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.570
team and give them ideas and help them and I of course I have been coaching

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.410
them and giving them ideas on quality little tidbits here and there before

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:12.010
then and this was the first time I discovered that given the freedom and

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:19.690
permission to do so developers can do very excellent testing not checking God

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:26.370
okay I'm gonna avoid that very deep good test they dug in they found bugs that

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:31.130
only the very some of them some of them just found very surface level things but

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:37.490
a good number of them found bugs that only the best testers I know may have

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:43.630
found very deep important bugs and they just they looked at how the system fit

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.710
together and found some flaws that were worth fixing definitely your P0 type

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:53.110
bugs so that was a revelation like yes they actually can do great testing

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.030
wasn't really revelation I expected it would happen but it sort of provided

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:03.590
some proof so in the early days we were trying to get we're trying to get

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:08.990
product market fit trying to prove viability trying to figure out if we're

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.550
making something that could be sold and as typical for many projects at Microsoft

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.630
there were several teams at the time originally working on similar things

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:23.850
they wanted something that was sort of compete in that slack space and over

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.120
time they we built in the the conferencing stuff too but we we kind of

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.760
won out along the Microsoft teams among the Microsoft organizations building

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.960
communication and collaboration type tools so at that stage all pretty good

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.760
we're still pretty small trying to find the right product we did and it was

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.800
working I over time I took over to have the most influence over quality I took

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:54.960
over running all of our infrastructure teams as well as kind of putting on a

00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:01.400
release manager hat for our beta and I left right after the beta to just have

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.760
as much control as I could as I could over what we were releasing quality

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.120
understanding understanding where risk was also in the modern testing world

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.240
helping the team get to a stage where they could comfortably release every

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.200
week and not worry about it's for the we actually release all the back-end

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.600
services all the time but the front end once a week and getting a team used

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:29.520
to that that was hard believe it or not because they were so used to your

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.640
typical waterfall ship every year projects a lot of these folks that they

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.400
would even for a once a week release they try and shove stuff in at the end

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:45.280
they say look the next trains coming by and I at the time when I was there I

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:51.360
really wanted to get them to continuous delivery on the front end right but we

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.880
just didn't have they didn't have the quality cultures to do it talk about

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:01.520
why in a minute I wanted to get there I ended up hiring a team in India to help

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.500
with testing because the develop I'll get to the crux of this the developers

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:14.720
were too busy doing other stuff to get to to get to doing the testing that it

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.520
needed to do and what it came down to was really the culture of the team

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.600
which is eventually why I left Microsoft Teams was I can say in my 22 years

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.680
at Microsoft hands down the most toxic culture I ever worked in there was

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.560
nothing about the customer it was all about pleasing your boss and pleasing

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:40.320
their boss I had never worked with such a huge group of suck-ups in my life

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.230
you know I said earlier I said it a million times you know unity it's easy to

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.350
do good work because the egos don't get in the way best ideas win the things

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:56.150
you want to see but at teams it was so hard to do good work because if you

00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:01.210
did the right thing for the customer doesn't matter if you didn't matter if

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:09.490
it's a huge win for the customer if it wasn't done in a way that sufficiently

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:15.770
sucked up to your manager or to their manager it was gaffod so we had a

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:19.850
program manager which is a Microsoft or like a product manager in the rest of the

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.890
world who was I remember the time I remember the time I knew the end was

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:30.450
near I was in a we used to call a war room meetings and then became something

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:37.710
else a ship room a ship room meeting and we had just put the the Alpha out or the

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:42.070
first beta some early release before the beta maybe it was the beta that went out

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:48.700
I can't remember what the order was and he had went and you know got feedback

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:54.650
from some other teams at Microsoft and some customers and came up with a list

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:58.090
of things that had to be fixed in fact I didn't know if it was customer-based I

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:03.170
think it was made money been from our VP but he's like ten things we gotta do and

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:08.060
we have to do these and we have to do them by this date and he went he got up

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.300
a little bit of a soapbox and said every priority is getting these things

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.060
done in time for in time for this whatever this date was we'll take

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.940
shortcuts where we need to we have to have these done and I chimed it said

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.580
yeah but we can't sacrifice quality we have a good quality release we can't

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:29.520
sacrifice it he got mad he is like yeah he says quality is one of the shortcuts

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.400
we'll take to get these done and at that point I knew I was in a losing battle

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.080
because he was fairly new to the org but he had joined the org because he was a

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:46.480
previous suck up of our VP and he had our VP's ear and once he knew that I

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.760
was against getting these features done over the favor of quality it was

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:57.640
basically impossible for me to get my job done so combination of that my boss

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:03.120
calling me at home to ask why I approved something for release just all kinds of

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:08.840
micromanaging and toxicity kind of caused me to leave but I think those things

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.240
this prioritization of features over quality this inability or unwillingness

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:18.400
to understand the value that CD brings to quality after I left they went to a

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.490
point where their changes and bugs were so jarring in their big weekly releases

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:29.770
that it's like my reaction be okay we just ship you know continuous delivery

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.290
ship our often puts FBI and feature flight theater right their immediate

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:38.080
reaction was to go ship that front end monthly instead of weekly and I have

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.480
told you a thousand times I'm sure you agree I would rather ship a hundred

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:47.240
times a day than once a month and I and I believe those things led to gaps

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:56.620
in quality I could say I can say that from a data perspective as advances as

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:02.840
you would expect any Microsoft team to be we could debug we knew exactly where

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.880
customers were getting failures and what was going on there the problem was there

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.000
were so many failures that we had a hard time prioritizing them sometimes it

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.480
wasn't it wasn't tractable because it was so frequent that's more into why I

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.760
left than the quality issues but I'm going from what I heard from immediately

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.440
after I left I talked to some people for a little while in fact I hired one of

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.800
my previous managers to take over my job when I left and he's much more of the

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.880
traditional test manager which I thought would be good for that org but

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.480
maybe it wasn't because he was all too happy to drop back to shipping once a

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.760
month and doing a full test pass with the even an even bigger team of

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:49.760
offshore testers in India and I think a lot of those things just trying there

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.920
was still trying when I left or at least in that first six months after I left

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.720
they were still trying to test quality in via outsource team and I just don't

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.440
think that's a good recipe for long-term quality success so that's where

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.120
I think happened there but I didn't even make fun of team as much as I want

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.040
except for the fact that I can tell you that it at least they have a

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.520
Linux client now which I have installed and uninstalled occasionally what I have

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:21.040
to do a Teams meeting but honestly zoom and slack I have to say whether I worked

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:28.820
on teams before or not I love so much more I would say teams is to its credit

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:37.800
teams being part of office 365 is genius because it's the collaboration app for

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.120
companies that don't know the need a collaboration app nobody's switching

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.800
from slack to teams released willingly but teams that don't use a collaboration

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.010
app they can they'll use teams and it's it's kind of okay it's not great there

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:54.690
are some bugs and not to say zoom doesn't have bugs and slack doesn't have

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.930
bugs these things all have bugs and I'm not gonna go list them all out and see

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:02.650
which one is buggier but for me the zoom slack combination has been pretty

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:08.570
awesome so anyway that that's the story of why I think quality remember do you

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.770
work with Ronnie Calabi yeah so he has that term he came up with the term he

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:16.570
coined the term the hippo the highest paid person's opinion and you want to

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.850
avoid that and be data-driven this team very much and they have a new VP in

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:25.050
place since I since in the last year or so but teams was very much at the

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:31.890
every feature every decision was at the whim of the VP running the org I

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:37.200
think that's what led to the quality where it was the story I think you just

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:43.640
told I mean it happened there were there were some things that I'm not

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:47.520
gonna talk about on the podcast that I think were unique to your situation

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:54.560
but in general I think 80 to 90 percent of your situation was essentially a team

00:38:54.560 --> 00:39:02.360
and transformation right it's essentially you had you had a lot of old

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:09.040
schoolers in the business leadership folks that would say hey I've been shipping

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:15.480
product for 20 years I know how to do it blah blah blah yeah at the same time you

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:23.680
had those folks building a what is essentially a service and not really

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:31.720
adapting well and what happened in this particular case I think your story is is

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:43.180
one around how agile transformations can go wrong right so I have talked about it

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.620
on the podcast as well you and I had different experiences and being the in

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:56.720
the Xbox right my experience on the Xbox org I will I'll just quite honestly say

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:04.880
very very aligned with the story you just told right they were not an agile

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:12.640
team they were a fragile team and they and it was during that period of time in

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:19.440
Microsoft where they were where again agile principles were being weaponized

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.560
instead of being used for the the benefit of the customer and there weren't

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.280
a whole lot of people that really understood how to do it even me at that

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:34.960
point in time like I left Xbox to to go to Bing at that point in time because

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:40.440
they were a service and I went to Bing to learn how to do this right and I did

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.120
and I don't know too much about the internal structure I have a few contacts

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.240
in teams I don't talk to them all that often but to me I think actually the

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:58.120
story to tell there right the difference between zoom and in slack in teams might

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:04.680
very well be I'll frame it as a hypothesis my very well be you know how

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.960
long it took teams to to realize that they needed to shift to it to some form

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:15.120
a CICD model yeah I don't know if they're there yet I don't I I would hope

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:20.560
so but I don't know it doesn't matter I have some evidence that they might be but

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:26.530
I can't say one way or the other I don't actually know but this is teams is where I

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.090
learned how to do safe deployments I'm we would do originally I got there we

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:38.160
had a both a dev environment and a test environment and the regular environment

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.600
the typical environments you have and the dev environment was always crappy and

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:48.720
I remember this is funny it's reminding me I remember that nobody on team is

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.400
before we ship but nobody used the prod everyone used dev go after use dev

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.680
loading get the new features but oh god this is bad but eventually we had one

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:04.240
environment with with ring deployment so we when we did our weekly release we

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.600
always like released on Friday but we did the snapshot on Monday and that

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:15.740
snapshot on Monday immediately went to prod but that version was only available

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:21.420
for first my team and then we roll it out to usually if it passed initial

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.360
sort of smoke testing would go to all of the Microsoft Teams team and then to

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.620
all of Microsoft and then eventually on Friday release it to customers which

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.440
was you know my first experience doing that kind of staged rollout which was

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:37.440
really powerful way to do that and that was fun and I loved it but hopefully

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.120
that got even faster but I totally forgot that yeah and I went back and

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:49.840
looked back in time the one thing I'll say is to the best of my knowledge teams

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:58.440
was the first time where you were taking a very direct hand in trying to

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:05.260
ship the waterfall team to to an agile team it was worse it was a it was a

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:12.310
edge it was a waterfall team who thought they were agile right yeah it yeah go

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:18.030
back to that's exactly my experience the back box and and for the listeners like

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:24.070
I left before Alan joined and any overlap at all there I don't think so

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:28.820
when did you do you remember when you left it linked in would show it I'm not

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:34.500
gonna go look at LinkedIn so I remember I joined Xbox on Halloween in 2013 yeah I

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:41.100
was in being so I think there was a gap of months there so no no overlap because

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:47.460
I I joined being in pretty certain 2012 I either joined Bing in 2012 or a left

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:53.140
thing in 2012 I don't remember the point of the story I think here and if

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.660
I go back in time as well I went back in into our podcast and look for what

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:03.490
was the date of the episode titled the conception of modern testing right that

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:08.610
was in 2018 which I believe you were already in unity oh yeah yeah for sure

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.970
I was well but right yeah we've been talking about we just didn't have a name

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.700
for it maybe we've been talking about modern testing for a long time right like

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:23.260
but it's the beginning right the my point is in terms of hey Alan did this

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:27.660
you know Alan keeps talking about all these principles and all these things

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:33.100
so how come teams is all screwed up the the one thing I'll say on that front is

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:41.570
you don't learn from success true only learn from failure and what I will say

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:48.250
is a lot of Alan's Alan and I have never had this good discussion but I am so

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:52.410
confident in what I'm about to say I'm gonna say it anyway you're wrong a lot

00:44:52.410 --> 00:45:00.210
of Alan's thought process around supportive of modern testing when he was

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:06.970
thinking through it he absolutely was considering what he views as personal

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:13.250
failures from his experience with teams right yeah I agree and there's there's

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:17.250
two things maybe to highlight there one is that definitely the modern testing

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:22.530
principles were nowhere near being formed at that point it took me going

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.490
back to managing a test team for a while at Unity to kind of think through

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:32.970
that as well as building that quality culture transition guide at Unity with

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:39.530
reflection on time I spent on Xbox and on teams doing coaching yeah those ideas

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:44.980
came primarily like even when I joined Unity back in a test manager role it

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:50.620
made me go back and think about what actually mattered and how testers should

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.260
work it's that's what I began to think about using it when you have dedicated

00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:00.500
testers using them to accelerate accelerate the achievable quality or to

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.580
accelerate the team versus be a bottleneck and then building that

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:08.340
quality culture and then and then maybe that last principle came from my time at

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.860
Unity when you have dedicated testers you can use them to help expand the

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:16.900
testing abilities and know-how across the org and all that came from a lot of

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:24.500
reflection and in fact when I first gave the talk in 2017 let me think whenever I

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.460
gave that talk at test bash in Brighton the first time I give a public talk

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.940
about modern testing it started with the history all the things I had learned

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.860
from Xbox and then from teams and then from Unity and how those all came

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:42.540
together into the principles so back on teams I had a lot of good ideas I

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.340
learned how coaching worked I learned how to teach I began to realize that yes

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:52.020
developers can be very very good testers but my full thoughts on how to

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.860
achieve quality even though I gave a talk on testing without testers my full

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.500
thoughts on how to achieve quality without dedicated testing specialists

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.260
didn't fully come to fruition for a few years after that based on what I

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:11.020
learned there and if both you and I have multiple different experiences around

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.100
attempting the principles trying things out and going well that didn't

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:20.540
work that that that that not only didn't work like one of the things I think we've

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:29.460
talked about in the past in my view agile principles will far out produce not

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:36.460
only slightly it will far out produce waterfalls based mentality okay it far

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:45.560
but the one thing that is the Achilles heel to agile do you want to make a

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:52.740
singular guess before I drop the bomb nope go ahead the Achilles heel to agile

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:59.740
is command and control absolutely right there is that I have yet to find anything

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:07.660
with with agile that that successfully survives a hierarchical structure where

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:15.940
the hierarchy is is against it right or or or even either against it directly or

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:22.020
indirectly even micro management might instead of using quantification or other

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:27.860
other means a customer usage to to sort of drive decision-making so that's

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:34.540
something that I think is is it's actually one of the reasons why you make

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.100
fun of me all the time on this one but it's one of the reasons why I actually

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:47.380
still do favor the safe methods because safe actually tries to make the

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:54.650
management part of the agile process instead of say scrum that's another

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:58.170
conversation on their slack channel right now around sort of the failings of

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:06.970
scrum and scrum scrum has had the sort of history of of enforced autonomy

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:12.870
management's the man and scrum is anti the man right and I think that actually

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:18.910
holds it down or holds it back and creates limits yeah that's my philosophy

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:23.510
yeah I'm with you man okay so that's kind of the story you know we can go

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:27.150
deeper if there are more questions but that was way easier to talk about it

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:30.830
here cuz I think it's interesting to everybody else and I like I like where we

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:34.030
got with that then trying to have an answer in slack again if you want to see

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.110
these slack conversations or ask your own questions in slack you can go to

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.790
modern testing org and join our slack group there is no cost for that it is

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:45.070
absolutely free of course you get what you pay for which is me and Brent being

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:49.390
smart asses in slack but it's fun we have we have we have taco emoji so it

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:55.750
would give away yeah one one additional thing that I at least want to say is

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:04.140
despite what you feel about teams I will say teams has actually been in a

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:12.740
important asset to the globe during the pandemic times I totally agree and I

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:17.060
think it goes back to the fact that the vast majority of people who are using

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.540
office 365 or office subscriptions to their enterprise they're not using any

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:27.860
other collaboration tool and it just it just gives it to them in a way that's

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:32.340
comfortable and it integrates with the way they work and then one thing worth

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:37.420
sharing it so I totally get that but I'll mention a name the old VP he really

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.860
wanted to compete with slack I want to take out slack and and Stuart Butterfield

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.660
was worried for a while he's put out that that full page ad the day teams

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:49.140
came out which was kind of cool but it says welcome to the welcome to the game

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:55.060
but it really fits the niche because those office 365 companies that use that

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:59.420
and there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of users in that camp

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:05.350
they're not going out and getting slack licenses they they just get teams as

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:08.790
part of the package they already have it's very convenient works very well I'm

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:13.950
all it it fits there very well something else I was gonna say there but I forgot

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:19.350
and we're out of time anyway all right okay everybody thanks for being part of

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:26.100
our podcast today all three of you you and you and you I'll see you next time

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.380
I'm Alan I'm brain bye bye
