WEBVTT

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.310
Hey, I'm Alan.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.810
I'm Brent.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.850
And we're back for another episode of A.B.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.370
Testing.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.330
What number are we on, Brent?

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.330
28.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.550
28.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.080
God, how did that happen?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.580
Cool.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.840
Yeah.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.240
All right.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.740
Totally.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.040
Apologies for anyone who has sat through all 28 besides us.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.680
We've gone through 28, right?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.680
We have.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.680
What's worse is that?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.000
We might have gone through 40.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.440
What's worse is that I go, not only do I sit here

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.040
through these, but I sit through it again while I edit and take

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.760
out all the dumb stuff Brent says.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.400
Not all of it, obviously, but most some of it.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.140
He does a fairly good job at that.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.660
And I said this on Twitter.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.740
Last time, our tech support team turned around

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.180
and seemed like just in two hours.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020
I think there was a long weekend coming up.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.060
I can't remember.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.260
I think it was the Friday before that Labor Day weekend.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.860
So I thought, if I don't get this done today,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.640
it's not getting done for a while.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.480
Well, again, the tech support team did a fantastic job.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.880
So this is weird.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.580
We use, for those of you interested,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.960
I used to use Audacity, which is a darn nice program

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.000
for recording as all the features I need.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For the first time ever, we have a debut in episode 28.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880
Something we've never done before.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.720
What's that?

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.340
Well, normally, I'm track one because, you know,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.640
and Brent's track two.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.920
But today, Brent's number one.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.040
Woo hoo!

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.000
That was purely a mistake.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.440
That'll be fixed in the next episode.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.360
And when I mix down the mono, you'll never know.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.060
But for me, I look and see what's going on.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.020
And I'm speaking in the wrong place.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.380
So I just wanted to share that with the audience.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.580
So this podcast is going to make you feel uncomfortable

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.260
the entire time?

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.700
No.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.220
Being in the same room as you makes me uncomfortable.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.100
You're not the first, nor likely the last,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.940
to give me that feedback.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.380
Yeah, I read the report.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.870
It's awkward.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.190
All right, let's get going.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.430
We got our list on the board.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.150
And we'll get through it here and probably get to none of it.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
Let's try and see if we can get to at least one thing.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.430
So Strata Conference, we talked a little about last time.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.490
You're going there.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.930
It's in New York next week.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.430
Yes.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.130
Holy crap, Batman.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.010
It's next week.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.010
It is.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.570
So me and one of my employees are going.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.570
We have a goal of recruiting like monsters.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.010
Got for the first time in like 15 years,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.850
we talked about this last time, got new business cards.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.980
And I intend to come back with none of them.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.980
All right, we'll see what happens.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.380
Are you going to tweet?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.260
Is it like fishing?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.220
Are you catching release?

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.540
Or like you hook them and you bring them home with you?

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.660
I mean, did you book like one ticket there and 50 tickets

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.220
back?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.660
That.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.000
You know, I don't know what the limit is on my end

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.380
of my card.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.060
But I am agile, so we'll see what happens.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.620
And the other thing, so last time I issued an offer out

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.840
to the three.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.880
If you want to connect, I'd love to meet you.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.100
I did get one of the three to reach out.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.900
So we'll figure out some logistics there.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.740
But you remember Percy from several episodes ago?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.540
He's like a guest member on the show.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.540
Yeah, and actually on the way in, I was thinking through,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.080
hey, since we only have three listeners,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.660
it probably wouldn't be hard to meet them all.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.100
It's great.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.680
And then, yeah, I like to think of anyone

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.040
who submits a mailbag item, or we talk about,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.480
they're part of the show.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.700
Absolutely.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.740
Actually, that was a stretch calling this thing a show,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.220
right?

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.140
Yeah, let's just roll with it.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.100
All right, cool.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.940
Speaking of like things and conferences and things,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.460
we talked, I'm not going to recap them going to Eurostar

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.740
for the mobile deep dive in November.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.430
But in between now and then, I'm

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.130
going to go give a short talk at the GoDaddy office in Kirkland,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.020
which I think is open to the public on October 9,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.500
Friday night.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.860
The talk is?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.340
Yeah.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.940
OK.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.660
So I'm doing like a half hour.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.980
And normally, I talk about very broad things.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.100
So I asked for suggestions, and they gave me a,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.520
what do you want me to talk about?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.460
I'll talk about anything.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.820
And they gave me a list of very specific things.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.820
Such as?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.660
Well, I don't remember.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.280
I only remember the one I selected.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.640
I said I can do that because I work on one of those, which

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.680
is strategies for testing a single page web application.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.720
OK.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.680
But I will turn that into one of my sweeping generalizations

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.760
full of opinions.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.260
But I'll talk about it a little bit.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.920
It'll be fun.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.280
And then I haven't worked out when yet,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.240
but I mentioned last time the wonderful people at Riot Games.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.500
And Trey McRae invited me to come to a sort of a night

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.420
of beer and appetizers they were having in Seattle.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.300
Brew-ha-ha.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.100
A brew-ha-ha, something like that.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.860
What was that?

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.780
Three or four weeks ago, I had a good time talking to people.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.220
And he contacted me and said, hey,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.540
our people like talking to you.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.060
You're fun.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.260
You should come talk to more of us.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.240
I'm going to go down to LA sometime for a day

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.540
and hang out with them and kind of see what they do

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.600
and talk to them.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.360
Of course, I don't know when yet, because my calendar's

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.210
been cray cray.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.810
So I got to get back to it and figure it out.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.530
Because I have my, I'm like, he said in the next few weeks,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.030
I'm looking at my calendar and I said,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.530
I think I can make this.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.910
So I got to look at my, sorry, I'll try and email Trey

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.190
before I post his podcast, because I haven't actually

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.350
replied to him other than the first one saying

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.190
I check my calendar and figure anything out.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.430
Does he listen to the podcast?

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.170
Yeah, he does.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.090
He apparently, and he's kind of a cool guy,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.410
so I don't know why he would do this,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.770
but he kind of stalks me.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.870
You're kind of a cool guy too.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.910
Birds of the feather thing.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.150
Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.670
I think there's a lot of, I mean,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.390
you have a lot of relevant skills,

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.150
a lot of relevant knowledge.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.030
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.470
Fake until you make it.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.090
Amen, baby.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.790
I wouldn't be at all surprised if TreyTray

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.920
tries to convert this into a move move.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.300
No, no, no, that's not what it's about.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.140
He's cool.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.980
We've talked about that.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.260
That's not in the cards.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.310
I am, yeah, long story there, but you know,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.060
at some point after 20 plus years of Microsoft,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.320
20 plus being 20 years plus three months,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.020
retirement, actually, you know what?

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.420
I don't know if you know this.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.160
It's September, less than three months,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.300
I qualify for AARP.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.900
So, you know, I'm as young at heart as I sound.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.860
I'm fricking old.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.260
You know, I was having this conversation

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.360
with one of my mentees just the other day.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.360
In a couple of weeks, I will have a 17 year old

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.920
and I'm just like, whoa,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.880
where the hell did all the time go?

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.600
Because when you go into work, right,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.990
we are surrounded by 20 somethings all of the time.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.470
Or people that act 20 something.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.310
Both.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.830
Microsoft is a little like Never Never Land.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.670
You come here and sometimes you never grow up.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.110
You never grow up and certainly physically,

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.950
there's this overwhelming perception,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.630
except for the few times in the day

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.470
you actually look in the mirror,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.430
where you sort of feel like you're the same age

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.110
of all the people you work with.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.130
So it does kind of befuddle me that I'm getting to a point

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.730
where I'm gonna start having friends who are in AARP.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.450
I'm not gonna, I'm said I'm eligible,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.570
I'm not gonna join, except for, you know what?

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.690
I think I get free dinner at Denny's on my birthday.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.530
So I don't know.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.770
I think everyone does that.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.610
Ah, crap.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.050
But the thing that's gonna be weird

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.930
is when we start going to lunch,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.910
you're gonna go, hey,

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.130
do you offer a senior discount here?

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.890
What's wrong with that?

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.050
Nothing.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.110
It's just gonna be a slap in the face of,

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.550
wow, I hang out with old people.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.670
Yep, I do.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.750
Because I'm in a crotchety mood now.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.990
Get off my lawn.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.430
I'm gonna skip ahead to the fourth item.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.390
We'll come back to that other one

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.110
because that's really a proper order.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.910
So it's been a long time.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.870
It's been a long time since we've had an installment

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.950
of Stupid Things Microsoft People Do.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.790
Otherwise known as Allen's Soapbox.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.630
Get off my lawn.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.290
So this one, I drink my coffee black

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.730
like it should be drank.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.850
This is like the preview.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.050
This is like the trailer that comes for the real peeve,

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.410
which has nothing to do with coffee.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.610
So I'm not gonna complain about.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.770
But black is the way God and the Colombians intended.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.850
One of the things that annoys people other than me

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.850
is people will add milk to their coffee.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.490
They'll open up some milk in their refrigerator

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.970
and they'll leave this half carton open

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.410
and the next person does the same thing.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.390
By the end of the day, you have like 12 partially opened

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.310
cartons of milk in the refrigerator.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.150
So that-

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.230
If they're in the refrigerator, what drives me next

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.590
is they leave it right next to the coffees.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.920
I don't like milk.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.760
At all?

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.720
I think milk was invented to make cheese and that's it.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.340
It has no other usage.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.220
It's not for drinking, all right?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.090
That's gross.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.930
Ick.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.170
What about chocolate?

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.810
Yeah, chocolate.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.830
And not necessarily milk chocolate, dark chocolate.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.130
But chocolate milk?

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.950
No.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:09:59.790
No, gross.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.630
That's disgusting.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.770
Milk chocolate?

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.210
No, sometimes, but no, dark chocolate

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.690
only because it goes well with wine.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.690
Hot chocolate?

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.100
No.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.940
Wow.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.780
Hot cocoa a little bit.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.900
No milk.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.340
Milk is gross, all right?

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.620
Not even the right soap box.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.940
Let's get on the other soap box.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.020
Nothing to do with milk.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.900
That's just a common complaint about people.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.420
So I work in a building, I've worked in buildings

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.220
with elevators before, but I'm a stair person.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.480
Now that I work on the 20th floor, I'm not a stair person.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.440
Although I do take the stairs down,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.720
if I have to go down to reception,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.240
five floors below, no problem.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.240
I take the stairs down from 28

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.360
where the cafeteria is to 20 all the time.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.200
But if it's more than two floors when I was three,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.560
I'd use the elevator.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.040
And obviously coming into work in the morning,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.760
I take the elevator.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.840
I don't even know how to take the stairs from the lobby.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.590
So anyway, because our elevator

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.970
goes to Microsoft floors, you have to use your card key,

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.190
little click thing to use the buttons.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.590
The buttons don't work.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.430
Unless you swipe your card.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.930
Unless you swipe your card key.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.470
So everybody knows this,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.970
because everybody's on Microsoft.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.990
Yet, yet.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.550
There's only a card key reader on one side of the elevator

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.590
in front of the bank there.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.580
And inevitably, every single day, every single ride,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.780
someone will step on, swipe their card key,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.680
press their button, and stand with their waist

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.480
about two inches away.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.640
From the card keys.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.520
Yeah, like I have to stick my hand in an HR unfriendly zone

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.440
in order to scan my card key.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.440
So I think, so hopefully, which I have refrained from doing,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.560
we're all introverts.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.480
You're like, excuse me, I need to stick my hand

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.840
in front of your, I scanned my card key.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.360
But usually I just hope that they picked a floor

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.460
that's a little lower than mine,

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.860
so they'll get the hell out of my way

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.420
so I can scan my card key and push the right button.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.220
If you're lucky also, there's buttons

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.540
on both sides of the elevator,

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.220
but the ones on the other side are useless.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.260
Unless you have a card key.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.680
But there is a window of about two seconds

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.920
after someone swipes their card key

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.780
where the buttons will work everywhere.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.340
So what I try and do is sort of tailgate

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.960
on their buttons.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.260
But the point is,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.840
that is like, that is access to the,

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.340
you are blocking access to me getting to work

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.220
because they're not guarding it.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.260
They're just not thinking,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.460
but it's just the weirdest thing

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.980
that they all scan my card key.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.460
I'm gonna stand right up here in this corner.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.140
It's like, dude, you're weird.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.070
And I wonder, do you think,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.490
this is probably inappropriate for the podcast,

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.790
but I wonder if there are some people

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.350
that maybe they just do it to get,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.540
see what the reaction is from other people.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.380
That's art.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.980
I now suspect you do.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.820
That's art.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.460
But I don't think these others do.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.680
One of the things I studied in,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.840
I'm a music composition major.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.120
So I studied not just classical composition,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.120
but modern composition and some of the modern art approaches

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.040
where the music,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.760
they said the performance, the music isn't the art.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.640
It's the audience's reaction to the music.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.600
That's the art.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.440
Sure.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.200
So when you do like John Cage's four minutes

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.040
and 33 seconds,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.720
so you can look, which is four movements of,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.160
three movements or four, I can't remember,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.910
but just silence.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.050
But the point is,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.650
as I got off of my tangent is,

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.490
somebody could look at that on the surface and go,

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.330
well, that's stupid.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.210
I could write that.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.050
And yes, you could,

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.250
but the music is how the audience reacts.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.330
And I've not only seen that piece performed,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.050
I've actually performed a percussion ensemble arrangement

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.290
of that piece we did.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.090
We did a whole year of John Cage pieces

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.730
and the audience reaction,

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.850
there is something to that.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.750
It's not all fluffy, fluffly, artsy, fartsy,

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.790
is the audience will react and it's interesting.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.720
I've lost you.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.860
Percussion ensemble.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.700
Yes.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.220
I didn't know you ever played any sort of percussion.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.020
Oh yeah, I was primarily a woodwind player,

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.860
but I did play a lot of percussion,

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.740
enough so that I actually faked and lied my way

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.060
into the percussion department during grad school.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.060
What instrument in particular?

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.860
We had a professor that didn't know everything.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.500
So mostly, I mean, everything.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.760
I'm versatile enough.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.880
I could do,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.740
I totally fooled him into thinking I could play everything.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.080
And going in, I was mostly keyboard percussion,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.020
so marimba, xylophone, vibraphone, et cetera, et cetera.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.740
So I did a bunch of stuff there

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.000
and then we did some snare drum stuff,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.460
which I can totally kick butt on

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.460
and I could fake my way through it.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.140
And then, and he gave me some really hard timpani stuff

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.620
and not on my fourth tape,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.540
but I just, you know, I'm really good at,

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.900
again, fake it till you make it.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.540
I practiced a lot and learned something

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.120
and looked up some things.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.000
In the library, didn't have the internet back then, I'm old.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.480
And anyway, faked it through.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.270
It wasn't until,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.210
one of the things you have to do

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.230
when you're in a music program is,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.370
play.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.250
I'm gonna smack you so hard in the head

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.730
that something funny's gonna happen.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.050
You have to do things called juries,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.370
which are the end of every quarter.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.310
Three or four of the music staff members,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.050
usually from your area, plus a few others,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.770
it's, you have to perform a piece for them

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.340
and they critique you.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.740
Like this is like your final.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.420
Like you imagine, if you're taking lessons

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.860
for a quarter in college,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.780
your final is you have to perform something

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.260
to show that you've actually learned something

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.540
from your lessons and you're applying

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.780
and you've been practicing and stuff.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.740
Kind of the musical equivalent

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.900
of defending your doctoral thesis.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.460
Yeah, at a smaller scale.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.000
I had to defend my master's thesis,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.900
which was,

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.290
again, I got so lucky.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.550
At the long story, I got so lucky.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.890
It's like, they showed me a score.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.270
So tell me about this piece.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.590
Like a score, you know, a score is like all the parts.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.760
And I'll get back to the other story in a minute, but.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.740
Score contains how many measures usually?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.140
Oh, the score is the whole piece.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:08.980
Oh, the whole piece.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.180
For every instrument.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.020
Oh, got it.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.420
And tell me about this piece.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.440
And I'm looking at it and,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.240
and they don't care if you know what it is.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240
They want to describe, like,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.980
you look at how the, what the instrumentation is

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.740
and how the instruments are used and chords.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.890
And from that, you can actually do some

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.890
pretty easy forensics and figure out kind of

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.650
have a good estimate when the piece was written

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.090
and maybe even who wrote it.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.850
I happened to recognize the score.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.730
Cause it was, one of the things I did

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.610
when I was bored in the library,

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.690
is I flipped through scores

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.570
and I actually knew exactly what it was.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.570
So I played stupid and said,

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.210
well, we got this and that and this,

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.170
and this is going on here.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.530
So it's probably Stravinsky.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.190
I'm fairly certain it's a soldier's tale,

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.870
but this, you know, I think you'd ever.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.710
Baa!

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.880
Oh my God, he pushed.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.880
No, no.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.880
The only person I impressed with what they do

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.040
for the master's thesis defense is

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.130
they have three people or two,

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.430
three people from my department,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.670
plus one person they grabbed from an unrelated department

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.370
to make sure they're not BSing me through.

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:15.370
So I blew him away.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:20.370
So the other part of that story was where was like...

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.490
Alan, the walking music genome project.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.330
Oh, I remember.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.850
So spring quarter, I had already done my thesis.

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.770
The only thing I had my juries to do

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.770
and my professor was there and somebody else,

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.770
the band director and director of bands,

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.430
sounds more exciting.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.430
And then the old, old percussion guy

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.390
who was on his way out,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.820
but he knew me from undergrad school.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.620
And I play my piece and I go,

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.180
he goes, he goes, he goes, he goes.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.420
And he said, you play percussion pretty well

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.370
for a clarinet player.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.910
And that's when I let the cat out of the bag.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.590
I said, my current professor,

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.790
progression professor said,

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.730
so you play clarinet?

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.950
I said, yeah, actually I was a woodwind major in undergrad.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.510
He goes, why did you, how come you ever told me that?

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.430
Because I said, I figured if I told you

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.670
I wasn't a real percussionist,

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.070
you wouldn't let me into the program.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.430
And he goes, oh yeah, you're probably right.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:22.490
The, your story, you ever watched the movie Drumline?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.340
Yeah.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.180
It's one of my favorites.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.020
Oh, good, so bad.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.100
But your story, oh, I love it.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.420
It's always been my-

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.740
How can you love that movie?

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.780
I was, Drumline two sucks,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.780
but Drumline one was a good movie.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.320
But your story kind of reminded me

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.100
of the competitions they do to see

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.030
who gets to be in the first string

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.120
or whatever the hell they call it in a marching band.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.380
The other thing, so we went to Walt Disney World

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.260
the other day, and you know the,

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.420
I'm sure you know the name,

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.420
but in the Epcot Center, the Japan area,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.340
they often had these women come out

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.700
with these sticks and these large kettle drums.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.540
Okay.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.840
And I could watch these guys forever.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.440
Love that style, love anything you do with the big ass,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.040
what do they call it, are they kettle drums?

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.680
Are they horizontal?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.380
No, not the horizontal like marching band things,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.340
but they look like-

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.660
Are they tuned?

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.500
Yeah.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.660
But they're gigantic.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.920
They're timpani or kettle drums.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.580
Okay, those are cool.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.420
You played that?

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.020
Yeah, I played that.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.020
You're slightly cooler now to me than you were before.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.860
That's great.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.320
So does Evan's thing count as a MB item?

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.600
It came in mail.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.960
All right, so we got a mail from Evan,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.000
and we're gonna talk about it in a minute,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.260
but you know what has to happen first.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.100
Mail back!

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.290
Wow, there was a little bit of lounge in that one.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.370
That was fantastic.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.650
I live for the lounge.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.490
All right.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.730
Wait, I was gonna go into Copacabana for a minute,

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.650
but I'll reel in the back.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.770
Reeling it back.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.610
Okay.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.450
Copa.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.500
Okay.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.120
What did Evan say in his mail?

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.880
Oh, I remember.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.920
So we got a mail from...

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.840
Mail back.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.680
...young Evan Lehrer.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.360
We used to work with Evan.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.360
Actually, I remember Evan when his career was just this tall.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:36.350
Now, when I first met Evan, he was freshly minted IC

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.510
in the test organization.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.270
He's now grown into leadership.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.870
He's left Microsoft years ago.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.710
He came from X...

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.310
Four or five years ago from Xbox, went to...

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.150
Amazon.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.510
Amazon.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.060
They sell books.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.060
Yes, everything else.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.340
Oh, by the way, I used just to see if it worked.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.650
I had Amazon...

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.360
We have at Amazon, same-day delivery, bring me some beer.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.170
It worked.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.290
Got like an hour.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.170
It was kind of expensive.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.370
I just wanted to see if I was bored on a Sunday.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.290
Neat story, Alan.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:13.450
Okay.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.290
All right.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.810
Somebody has to come in handy.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.120
You can go to 7-Eleven, get it in 15 minutes.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.880
Yeah, no, actually it'd take longer.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.510
There's no 7-Elevens that close to my house.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.350
But I could have gone to the store.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.230
But if you're already two hours in and running out of beer...

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.110
I could have gone the thrift way.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.310
I just wanted to see how they...

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.950
I was kind of curious how the process worked.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.750
It was a purely exploratory order.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.950
You know, one of the problems with the current room we're in

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.270
is that we don't see the clock.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.830
We're good.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:44.670
No, I know.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.300
It's 8.30.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.820
And it reminds me of some feedback we got in the last podcast.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.540
Did you see that Twitter or tweet?

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.300
Oh, yeah, after the rambling...

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.860
After the 20-minute rambling, you guys got to a great point.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.080
I think that was mentioned a positive way.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.320
In my head, that was said positively.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.480
Oh, it was.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.240
And the fact that we actually made a point...

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.240
Because usually we have to ramble for 40 minutes.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.240
Sure.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.910
Then improvement.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.710
Wait, go with that white net improvement.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.710
So anyway, Evan sent a mail.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.710
Evan's at Redfin now.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.710
Fast forward to the...

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.510
Oh, look, they made a point.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.510
Evan's at Redfin and he asked...

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.910
He said, AB testing Roadshow.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:27.910
Yes.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.910
And we said, Roadshow?

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.500
Okay.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.500
So his mail was to...

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.100
Hey, guys, it has been a while.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.100
I hope it's all as well with you.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.300
Thanks for asking, Evan.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.100
It's going great.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.100
It is going great.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.100
Alright, keep going.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.100
I recently joined Redfin as their Seattle QA manager.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:52.100
The company is at an inflection point moving from three-week waterfall releases...

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.260
What is that?

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.260
That's like a Scrummerfall thing, right?

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.260
Yeah.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.260
Yeah, okay.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.260
But at least he knows that it's not Scrum.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.260
What ifs?

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.260
Yeah.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.260
What ifs?

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.260
To a continuous integration model.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:11.390
However, there really isn't much expertise in the company on how to navigate this transition.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:19.520
By the way, Evan, if we're releasing NDA stuff, I'm sure Evan's the only one at Redfin that listens to us.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.740
We're probably fine.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.740
You know, I don't think there's anything...

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.740
It's not like he said, and we're moving...

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.740
We're doing a special new project.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.740
It requires us what it does.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.740
It allows you to blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.740
So he has questions.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.740
Yeah.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.740
There are questions going around like, so do all devs need to write tests now?

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.740
Yes, next.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.740
And can we ship code to production without QA involvement?

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.030
It depends.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.030
Next.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:48.030
And as a QA engineer, do I have a place in this new world?

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.960
It depends.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.960
Let's talk about that.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.080
Yeah.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.080
While I'm trying to help guide, it may be helpful to have some outside experts give a tech talk to the engineers.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.080
Oh, I missed the part where you wanted experts.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.080
I think we're out.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080
Fake it.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.210
What do you guys think?

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.210
I have a question.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.210
What's a QA engineer?

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.360
He doesn't say QA engineer.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360
I thought you said the QA engineer.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.360
Oh, that's right.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360
You're right.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.360
As a QA engineer...

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360
Of course I'm right.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.360
Do I have a place in this new world?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.360
Well, the first question's easy, but we should probably give it a longer answer.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.360
So the first question was, do all devs need to write tests?

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.040
Do all devs need to write tests now?

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.040
Can we ship code to production without QA involvement?

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.040
No, dude, learn to read.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.040
Read that first sentence again so people understand it.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:43.070
So do all devs need to write tests now?

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.070
The long answer...

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.070
I give the short answer is yes.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.070
The longer answer is yes.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:54.070
Or affirmative.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.070
Okay, yeah.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.320
That is absolutely because...

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.320
Well, you tell me why because.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320
I don't tell you why because.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.320
Let's actually give a real long answer.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.320
If not, who's going to write the tests?

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.320
And actually, we've pounded on this forever.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:16.090
I think for many tests, especially unit functional, making sure your stuff works,

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:21.090
there is no better person to write those tests than the person who wrote the code.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:28.280
At some point, there's a line in where that's no longer true.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.410
And let me give you an example from my team.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.410
Our team, I wouldn't call myself a QA engineer.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:40.570
I'm just still a software engineer, but on a team that doesn't have any testers.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:47.570
So I guess I cover some of that, but our devs are starting to actually get good at writing tests.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.570
What?

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.570
How is that possible?

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.570
And not just unit tests.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.570
We have our unit test suite is growing and becoming very valuable.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.570
But they're also writing what we call scenario tests,

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.570
which you could call user journeys or whatever.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.990
But some end-to-end-ish tests.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.990
And they're getting better and better.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.990
The tests are getting less flaky, and they're covering more of the product.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.990
And they're running all those, which is great.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.990
And then we had a weird bug come in last week,

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.050
and we thought, well, how do we miss that?

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.050
And then it only took me a few minutes to go, you know what?

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:29.440
Our devs are very good at writing tests that test the happy path of the product.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.440
And we are actually, we have a good, comprehensive suite

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.080
that we make sure our product works as long as you stay in the rails.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.080
If you start doing those weird things that testers think of,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.080
like what happens if I do this 100 times?

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.080
What happens if I, you know, blah, blah, blah?

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.080
Those things can cause problems.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.240
So my job as a, I'm still a common software QA engineer,

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.240
but part of my job is to help them get better at that.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.240
And also for me to do some of that myself,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.240
and I'll spend some time with them.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.240
In fact, I have some meetings set up next week with each of the feature teams.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.330
Kind of spend a half hour sort of brainstorming through the,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.330
sort of how you look at the edge cases.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:18.330
We'll call them edge cases for now, but the nonstandard scenarios.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.330
So, oh, by the way, Brent and I, Brent's taking notes.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.330
Yeah, Brent's taking notes because we're actually putting together

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.330
the outline for our presentation as we cast.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:35.330
Yes, we skipped ahead, but we agreed to go and talk to Redfin.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.330
Yeah, so yeah, we did.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.330
So I think the first thing we talked about is developer testing

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.330
and a little chunk on that,

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.330
and we'll have some stories and anecdotes there.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.330
And if you want to, you can add something to that,

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.190
or I'll shut up and let you talk about the next question.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:54.440
Well, there's one of the framings that I'll put on this one is,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.440
anytime you're trying to do this change management,

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.440
you have to consider, and I've said this a billion times

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.440
on the podcast, you have to consider three aspects.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.570
The people, how they need to change, the technology,

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.570
what needs to change, and how do the processes,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.570
the bridge between the technology,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.570
how we expect the people to use the technology in a new way.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.500
All of these questions, every time I have gone and done

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.500
any sort of talk on these topics,

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.850
the primary issue comes down to, wait,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.850
so you're saying that the culture I'm used to is going to have to change?

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:37.330
Yeah, yeah, that's what we're saying.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:41.940
The other thing I think that we'll have to cover in this,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.390
certainly what, why, and how.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:52.770
Usually the why is what seals the deal

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.770
in terms of getting them to go forward.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:00.090
And this is not just, we should understand from Evan,

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.090
maybe even beforehand, why are they making this change?

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.090
Maybe, usually there's a good reason for it, right?

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.090
When you might make a change?

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:14.120
Like there's a reason they want to do continuous integration

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.120
and have high daily quality instead of good quality

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.120
once every three weeks.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.120
They want to make that transition.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.150
They don't have to.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.150
There's a reason for it.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:31.440
Some teams make these changes because they heard from some other team

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.440
that it had some benefit and they don't want to be left out.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.600
I've got to imagine that a company like Redfin wouldn't do this

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.600
for that type of reason, that there's probably some business goal

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600
that they're trying to achieve.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.600
But it's important if the team needs to make that transition,

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.600
they are much more apt to make that transition

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.850
if they understand why they're doing it.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.850
Yes.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:58.850
Unless, you know, because there are probably people that

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.850
absolutely see it's going to be better.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.850
Some that think, whatever, I'll go along for the ride.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:05.850
And some that think, screw this, we were fine before.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.850
Why don't we need to change?

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.850
This is true for any sort of cultural change.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:09.850
Yeah.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:10.850
Yeah, those three camps.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:15.850
But the way you loop in and get momentum towards making the change happen

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.850
is make sure everybody understands why you're making the change

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:26.270
and what it's going to get better as a result of moving in this direction.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:34.520
Yeah, and set up the right training, set up the right, for example,

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520
continuous integration.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.520
They're going to want to go from moving three-week waterfalls

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.520
to a continuous integration model.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:46.780
I have yet to see a team that is able to do that successfully

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.780
without some serious architectural investments.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.680
Well, I mean, we can talk hypothetically about this,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.680
and we will for a moment before we get to the rest of the questions and notes.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.250
What would I do?

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.250
You make sure, so they have a build server.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.250
Sure.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.250
Because they're building, I don't think they're building once every three weeks.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.250
They're building and testing.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.250
And if I'm going to imagine a three-week waterfall,

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:15.280
they do some planning for a couple days.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.280
They write code for a week and a half, then they stabilize for a week.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.440
That would be what I would do with a three-week waterfall.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.440
And some people are thinking, hey, man, that's how my team does Scrum.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.440
Well, that's a three-week waterfall.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.510
No, I don't know if you know this.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.510
I have a bunch of slides on this.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.510
They've done studies as to what is the best sprint size.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.510
Two.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.600
It is.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.600
Two weeks.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600
What's the worst?

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.600
Three.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.600
Because it's screwy.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.800
It is indeed.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800
Three is worse.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.800
Well, three isn't the worst.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.800
The point is three is worse than four.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.370
Three is worse than four.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:02.470
But it's actually three, one, four, two.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.880
Really?

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880
Yes.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.880
And that's interesting because I've done one-week iterations before,

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.880
and they're kind of fun, but two feel good.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880
I like two-week iterations.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880
So do I.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.880
I've been pushing our team for that.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880
I haven't got there.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:24.880
The main reason why three is what they have found is any team who tries to onboard

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:38.080
onto Scrum pure but pick a three-week sprint, it is the forces of evil.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.660
We'll turn that into two weeks coding, one week stabilization.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.660
And I don't remember the numbers off of my hand,

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.660
but it's over 50% of the time.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.980
Interesting.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.980
So back on topic.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980
Yep.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:57.980
And by the way, number one or one week is the second worst because the typical

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:04.170
Scrum overhead becomes too costly in one-week iterations.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.170
It might depend on the size of the team.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:10.170
But anyway, as I said a minute ago, back on topic,

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.170
I don't want to dive too deep in the technology stuff,

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.170
but they have a little bit of a walkthrough as an overview.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:20.170
They have a build server that have to figure out if it's configurable to run

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.170
automatically on check-in.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.170
And CI means you have a rich suite of tests that run as part of check-in.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:30.170
And this can be depending on what they have already.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:35.170
Jenkins is very popular, but we use VSO for CI as does a chunk of Microsoft

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.170
because we make it.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.170
It's good for us to test it.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.170
Anyway, there's some technology things we've got to figure out how they can

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.170
do builds on every check-in.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.170
You have to look at the size of their team.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.170
Maybe they can't do a build on every check-in and they have to batch.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.170
There's all trade-offs through there.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:54.170
But the idea is that every build that goes to the CI server is at a min bar

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:58.170
quality level defined by the suite of tests that run.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.590
And hopefully that min bar is very high.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.590
And if not, you add more tests.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:08.680
The other thing too that you, like I actually think every one of these

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.680
questions we could do a whole hour tech talk on.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.680
Yeah, so that, yeah, especially you.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.680
Because you babble.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.680
All right, what was it?

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.680
Let me put it this way.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.680
I think you could do a whole hour tech talk on.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.680
There is cultural stuff.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.680
And there's a good story, you know, the Flickr story of, I'll dig it up

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.680
and share it.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.680
Because there's a story where they're, and I'm going to horribly

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.680
paraphrase this, like I've horribly paraphrased all my stories that I

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.680
read and forget most of the details on.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.680
But I'm 90% sure it was Flickr where the CEO said, or some other

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.900
high ranking person said, I want to be able to ship every day.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.190
And his team was doing sort of this three week waterfall thing,

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.190
you know, or something like that.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.220
And they said, you're freaking high.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.220
And, but that was his rallying cry.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.220
And the rallying cries were important.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.220
And they got better and better.

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.220
And they got to shipping a high quality product every week.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.220
And he had a big party and celebrated.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.220
People said, why are we celebrating?

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.220
We need to get to every day.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.320
And it's like, oh, I don't, you know, it's one of those

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.320
things where I set the goal of every day in order to get to

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320
every week.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.320
And the employee said, screw that every day.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.320
This is fun.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.320
The other thing too, right?

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.320
Waterfall to continuous, not only continuous integration,

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.440
in terms of like the infrastructure,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.440
the technical infrastructure, but it also implies a shift to

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.440
Kanban.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.440
Or something you want a shift to high daily quality.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.440
Yep.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.440
A shift to some of the things that have to happen is you're

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.440
not going to have, you're not going to think of features of

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.440
things that span three weeks.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440
Nope.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.440
You do things in small chunks.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.440
And you have to have monitors.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.440
Like, I don't know if their technology is that big enough

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.440
that they need to worry about exposure rings,

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.440
but they do need to have the ability to do detection on

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.440
prod and quick reverb.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.440
Right.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.440
And when you think about it, and he doesn't necessarily say

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.760
they're doing CI to prod, but CI.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.760
And you can make that choice to promote the prod.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.920
Moving from three week waterfall releases to a

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.920
continuous integration model.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.920
So there's a bunch of knobs to turn there.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.920
Yeah.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.920
If they're, if, you know, maybe, let's talk about this

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.920
for a second, and we'll, I don't want to, we don't need

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.920
to do the whole talk here, but if they had, say,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.920
I assume they have a week of stabilization built into

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.920
their three week waterfall.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.920
That means it takes them a week to stabilize their

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.920
product.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.020
That would, how do you do it?

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.170
How do you stabilize that product now in a day, so

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.170
you can release it in a day or in an hour, so you

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.170
got, or continuous.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:44.170
One, you don't mess it up that much.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.170
You have to automate a bunch of that testing.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.170
You can't, you can't let bugs linger.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.170
There's a whole bunch of knobs you have to turn

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.170
slowly, and they're not going to get there.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.170
They're not going to go, okay, we finished our

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.170
three week sprint today, tomorrow, we start, we'd

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.170
start releasing CI.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.170
It isn't going to work that way.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:05.490
So there's a build, like to me creating the right

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.650
branch integration strategy is key here, and having

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:15.650
a principle that your main branch is always RTM-able.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.650
Yep.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.650
So changes as best as possible.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.650
Don't integrate into main branch unless it's passed,

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.650
but you want to evaluate on the change by change basis.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.650
So we have our model, we use Git, and our model

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:33.650
is develop branch is equal to our CI environment.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:38.200
So this goes through CI, goes to the develop branch.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.200
Master is our, currently our dog food, but our

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.200
production environment.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.290
Perfect.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.290
So we just do emerge from when this develop build

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:49.290
is good.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.290
But do you have a check-in based integration model?

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:54.290
Yes.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.290
Or is it a batch integration?

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:01.710
We do both because we have, we have actually,

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.710
it's a weird, ours is complex.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.710
We have multiple gates, but we're actually moving

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.710
from batch to check-in.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.710
Awesome.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.710
And the check-in, per check-in runs all of the

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:18.930
unit tests, a subset of all of our longer scenario

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.930
protractor or selenium tests.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.930
And if any of those fail, it's rejected.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.930
Otherwise they go in to develop.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:26.930
We know they're pretty good.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.930
And then we immediately run a much richer suite

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.930
of tests there to make sure there are no other

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.930
integration problems, other people's checks going in.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:36.930
Yep.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:37.930
So those are going on all the time.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.930
Continuous testing, all the time on that develop branch.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.930
We also have monitors running in our, both our

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.930
pre-production environment and our dog food environment

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.930
that find out if any of those things begin to fail.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:50.930
Actually in our, we have those monitors running

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:53.930
in our CI environment now too, to find out if anything

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.930
gets like slower or fails.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.930
So we have lots of checks and monitoring things

00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:59.930
which are really pretty good.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:00.930
So I don't know.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.120
Again, those are knobs we're slowly turning

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.250
because we're not, unfortunately, we're not to see,

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.250
we're not to high, we don't have consistent

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.250
daily quality on my product.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.250
But we're, so we're kind of along the same journey

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.250
a lot farther along than Evan's team is.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.250
Yeah, no, I think you guys are exactly on

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.250
the same journey.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.380
And I also think that turning the knobs slowly

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.380
is what makes sense.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.700
Boiled frogs, man.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.700
Boiled frogs.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.700
That's right.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.340
Because again, you have to turn multiple knobs

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.340
simultaneously to get this word.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.340
If you shifted, if you were to say,

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.340
hey, tomorrow we're all can-ban.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.340
And you don't have the people trained up,

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.340
you don't have the technology in place.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.340
I don't know.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.340
It's an exaggeration, but you probably won't

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.340
have a company in a couple of months.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.630
You have to bring people along for the ride.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.820
We got on this tangent by the QA stuff.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.820
We're not on tangents.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.820
We're right on time.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.820
By definition, we don't tan.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.820
All right.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.820
What else are we talking about?

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.820
As a QA engineer, do I have a place in this new world?

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.430
Oh, haven't we talked about that a whole bunch?

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:16.430
We could argue that was the whole reason

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.430
we started the podcast.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.430
It is, and I think, oh, wow.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.460
That was nostalgic.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.460
My head really wants to go off on a tangent,

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.460
but I have a whole other topic that I'm going to stay right.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.460
There are no tangents in A-B testing.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.460
We just covered this.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.460
Okay, I'm not going to go there.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.460
But I guess it depends, but listen carefully.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:44.970
If the only role on the team is to write software,

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:48.970
implement software, and write happy path functional tests,

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.970
there may not be a role for a QA engineer.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:52.970
No.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.360
But that's a really horrible way to make software.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.360
You can't just implement code and write happy path tests.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.360
You need those generalizing.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.360
I think the former QA engineer is the generalizing specialist

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.360
or specializing generalist that helps the team accelerate

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.360
productivity, applies systems thinking to make sure

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.360
the edge cases and corner cases and things like reliability,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.360
perf, globalization, et cetera are all addressed.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.360
They look at the product overall to find out what is the,

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.360
because you're doing CI, how do we get better every day?

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.360
Most of your engineers aren't thinking of that,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.360
but QA engineers I think are uniquely, former QA engineers,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.680
are uniquely tuned to do that sort of thing.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.960
They are.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:48.000
They're also helpful in terms of training up the other dev.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
My ideal scenario when we're seeing this,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
now, Evan, there's nothing in what Evan's talking about

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.320
that suggests that they're considering unified engineering.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.320
That's correct, but even if you're not,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.320
let's say you have a test team and you're doing it,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:15.380
but again, I think unified engineering is almost irrelevant

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.380
to this conversation because this role is going to change

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:25.600
regardless to more of an engineer role to do CI,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.600
if you're going to have daily high quality builds.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.080
You're not going to be running a test pass every day.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.080
The one issue, so let me ask you this,

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.080
because we've talked about this in the past,

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.080
but we've now had more experience,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.080
the statement that I've said in the past is still true today.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.080
Any team that I've seen where they're trying to move

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.240
quality upstream and get dev doing more testing,

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:59.040
if they have a low to medium level,

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:04.240
even just one QA engineer in their scrum team,

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.680
the model doesn't work.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.040
I've not seen a single situation.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.040
I've seen situations where there was a 10 to 1

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:19.360
dev to low to middle level QA guy,

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.360
and those devs are like,

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.360
I don't know what management's thinking.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.480
How is one guy going to get all of this work done?

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.480
The culture shift is just not going to happen.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:39.480
The dev seniority at minimum will overpower this one low level guy,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.480
just as a strong man to defend.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.480
Evan's not a low level guy.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480
He's not.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.480
But we're talking about his team.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.480
I guess so.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:58.470
I think what you're saying is that if the lower level QA tester guy or girl

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.560
is going to have less,

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.720
not going to have the ability to have the influence on the dev team

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.720
to teach them how to help them write better quality software.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.720
Is that correct?

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.720
Yes.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.720
And even further,

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.720
and we've talked about this what, two, three episodes ago,

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.720
once the codependency loop starts?

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.010
Yes.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:24.010
I think you've got to eliminate that no matter what, right?

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.010
Right.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.010
So let's talk about that.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.010
And we'll maybe give a little bit of information from Evan first,

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:37.270
but you don't want to put them on the scrum team to be dev's bitch.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:38.270
Right.

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:40.270
So what is their role there?

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:41.270
And Evan can help.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.270
Any leadership can help figure that out.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.720
I've obviously done this for a long time,

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:52.720
but in my team I'm totally comfortable being the one sort of test guy

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.720
for 70, 80 devs.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.870
Yes.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:58.870
I don't go to the...

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:03.120
Your experience, right?

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.120
So I got to think...

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.120
You're like, no.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.570
That is not what I'm paid to do.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:10.570
Right, absolutely.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:13.570
And in fact, we have...

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:17.570
I have five vendors here that do some testing for us,

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.570
and I've embedded them in the feature teams.

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:22.570
And it's even less than that.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.570
Not only have the one tester in these feature teams,

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.570
I had them span multiple feature teams,

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.570
because only five of them.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.860
And they are very well trained.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.860
When someone says,

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.860
hey, can you do this test pass for me?

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.860
Can you do this for me?

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.860
Their answer is no.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.860
That's not what I do.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.860
They say, what are you...

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.860
But you're a tester.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:44.860
I say, what?

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.860
And they're very much a liaison and a consultant.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.860
They will brainstorm with the Scrum team on how to do some testing.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.860
These are fairly junior people.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.860
But the model, I think, works.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.860
Imagine Evan is a senior guy with a bunch of junior people.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.860
That model sort of works.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.860
As long as he facilitates their role in that Scrum team,

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.860
you can have the more junior people there.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.860
And be successful.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.860
Yeah, I think the insight we just got on here is,

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.080
if you pay active attention to making sure that co-dependency loop

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.150
never, ever, ever starts, then there's hope.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:25.150
Yeah, I think so.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:28.150
And the plans work them well, because not only do they...

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.150
And I talked to the engineering managers,

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.150
who are massively more senior from these testers.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.150
They still seem as really valuable,

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.150
because they provide that different insight.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.150
Testers just look at the product differently.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.150
And then also, they take...

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:43.150
Because they look at the product collectively as a whole.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:46.150
In fact, those five vendors probably know the product

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.150
end-to-end better than anyone.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.150
But they'll go to their different feature team meetings

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:54.150
and bring that information back to the collective.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:47:00.370
So that little bit of that plugging in is super valuable.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:01.370
So I think if you...

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.370
I don't know, that's the only model that will work.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:06.370
But for me, having those five vendors

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:08.370
get connected with those...

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.370
We have eight engineering managers,

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.370
who own...

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:17.370
I'm totally estimating here, let's say 15 feature areas

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:18.370
of our product.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:20.370
And so far, it's working out pretty well.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.370
They're a little stretch thin, but again,

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:26.370
it's my job to make sure that if they need to...

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.370
It makes sense to spend a little bit more time

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.370
working with a team on this feature.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.370
I'm going to make sure they're ramped back on other things

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.370
so they're not stretched too thinly.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:35.370
I just had another idea.

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:39.370
Let me interject that and love to hear what you have to say.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:40.370
All right.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:45.370
I'm reminded back to the old days when our friend James

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.370
was still at Google and he was describing...

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.370
What was his name?

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:55.370
James White Watson Whittaker something?

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:57.370
Whittaker, whatever.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.370
Yeah, that guy.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:00.720
He was describing...

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.720
And Google's changed, right?

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.790
I don't get the sense that the principle they used to have

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.790
of if you want to change teams tomorrow,

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:12.790
you just notify the right people.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:13.790
I don't think that that's...

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:17.790
I think Google's gotten a lot more command and control-ish.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:18.790
Yeah, I have no idea.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:19.790
Get to your point.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:20.790
Get to your point.

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:21.790
Okay.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:27.160
So back in the day, QA guys could pick and choose

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.610
where they wanted to work.

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:32.610
So if they were engaged with a dev team

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.960
and that dev team was trying to do some of this

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.990
dev bitch stuff, that dev team lost their QA guy

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.340
because I don't like working with you.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.340
I'm going to go work on that thing.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.340
It doesn't work.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.340
I mean, yeah, it's harder when you're at a smaller company

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.340
because your option is to quit and apply for other jobs.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:58.240
Yeah, I guess it depends on how many choices you have.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:04.780
But if you dramatically short the dev to QA ratio,

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:10.810
if there's only one QA per dev team of, say, seven...

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.450
Even that's too high, I think.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.450
But go on.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:18.450
Then you could potentially start up a process of,

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:24.120
hey, one of your QA guys comes to you and says,

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.120
hey, I didn't like this.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.120
I need your help.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.120
You don't need my help.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:32.280
Tomorrow you're going to work with that team is set.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.280
I don't know about that model.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280
We can explore.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.280
So you should...

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.280
You understand what the benefit would be of that?

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.310
Yeah.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.310
Okay, good.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.310
You want to keep them engaged.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.310
I think we have enough information for an outline.

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:46.310
And Evan may listen to this podcast and go,

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.310
all right, guys, I'm good.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:48.310
You don't need to come.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.310
I doubt it.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.310
I'm good.

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:56.820
We talked about what the themes for...

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:57.820
We didn't even...

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.820
I don't know that we even really covered...

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.820
It's done, man.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.820
Presentation's done.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:02.820
We're good.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.820
Okay, awesome.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.820
I'll put together a slide of some sheep and a balloon and...

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.820
The Avengers slide.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.820
I like your Avengers slide.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.820
You should put that one in.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:11.820
Oh, we should do that.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.820
We should do some of that.

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.820
So it's P...

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.820
Yeah.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:15.820
Yeah.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.820
And the one that goes after that whole sequence there.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.110
Perfect.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:19.110
So what do you think?

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:21.110
I think we better call it a day.

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.110
All right.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:23.110
All right, everybody.

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.110
I am not Brent.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:25.110
And I am.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.110
See you next week or next time.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.110
Again, Strata next week.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.110
We're done.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:32.110
We're done.

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:33.110
We're done.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.410
You don't get to talk after goodbye.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:37.410
Reach out to me on Twitter.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:38.410
See you guys.
