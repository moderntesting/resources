WEBVTT

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:17.370
Hey everyone, I'm Alan. I'm Brit. And we are here for episode 75 of AB testing. Quite possibly

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:26.730
the first and only ADHD free podcast we've ever done. When we started recording five

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.730
minutes ago, I said we had technical difficulties and indeed we did because we are starting over.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.690
It was only five minutes ago we started and we said that. We are starting a little late,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.370
might be a little on the short side today. And right now people are cheering going, oh

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.370
thank God I don't need to sit through an hour of this crap. AB testing is your podcast for

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.170
information about software testing, software quality, much more of a software quality podcast,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.370
agile testing and what we call modern testing and lots of listener input to give us ideas

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.410
to focus because we need ideas to focus, right, Brit? No, it's part of the charm of the podcast.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:18.190
I will say that as well, right, Alan corrected himself. I think that we are not necessarily

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.850
while testing is a part of it. I think we're far more a podcast of on quality than around

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.740
testing. But we spent a lot of time talking about better ways to deliver quality, including

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.860
those places where testing is not it. Absolutely. Yep. Quick little pitter patter here, chatter,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.980
pitter patter chatter. I was in Montreal right after we, right before we recorded our last

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.420
podcast. I mentioned that and in between I went to Heathrow, didn't make it all the way to London,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.660
maybe to dinner for some moderately okay meals, but hung out at an airport and Heathrow for two

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.200
days with my peers and my manager. And one of the three were there. Marcus is a Marcus is a peer of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.780
mine hanging out with us talking about teams and strategy and people and stuff and very good

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.270
discussions. So good. In fact, we decided we need to do it twice a year and we're getting together

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.690
again in six months in Reykjavik, Iceland, because we try to pick places that everyone can have a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.080
direct flight. Yeah, I'm a little jealous of your travel schedule. Like I was just telling a story

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.480
last night to one of my PM's that except for the Bahamas, I have never been out of North America.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.800
Wow. Yeah. And it is part of the time. I mean, there's been many opportunities for me to go do

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.880
business trips, but I at times I am too clever for my own self-interest. So I figured out ways

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.610
where we can solve the problem. I'd prefer to solve the problem, including the trip, but I've

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.130
now come up with a way where I don't have to do that. I'm like, damn it. You are too clever.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.420
Stop fixing this problem. I think there's a problem with data piped through Hawaii. I need

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.020
to go debug. That's not really leaving North America. I guess it. No, I mean, I don't know.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.580
It's not leaving the States. Technically, leaving the North America.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.780
What continent is Hawaii considered part of? It's an island. Good trivia question.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.860
I know that. Okay. I just call it an island. So one way you can not travel is to give webinars

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.940
from the comfort of your own home with or without pants. And I'm going to be giving two

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.140
of those coming up in Feb. Next Tuesday, I'm giving one for AST on the use and abusive

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.740
test automation. Then I go skiing for a week, and then I come back and give a webinar, webinar

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.540
slash panel discussion on the feature of test automation. If it's not officially announced

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.860
yet, but as soon as it is, I'll put a plug out there on Twitter and the A-B testing

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.580
site and go from there. And what is the future?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.380
A lot of what we talk about in modern technology.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.500
All right. So I'm guessing no surprises for me on this one.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.300
Surprises for you. So why don't we just ...

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.780
What's the contradictory future? I'm wondering about that.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.380
Is it really contradictory? I think it's what we've talked about with moving to modern testing.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.020
I keep on visualizing the diffusion of innovation curve, and I see modern testing is out towards

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.500
the end, maybe not all the way on the end. I think there's still a lot of the world

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.460
with people in that big part of the curve with separate teams doing test automation.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.740
And for them, the future is an embedded tester who does all the testing for the team as part of an

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.700
agile team. On that topic, I should look this up, but when does the survey close?

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.500
The survey is closed, I believe. The state of testing survey ended last week.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.180
Okay. Good. I'm looking forward to the results on that one and seeing if I can help determine

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.300
what I'm really interested in, and maybe that will be an important source of data for that.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.660
I'm really interested in trying to observe how close to the tipping point the world is on this topic.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.620
I would love to get some data-driven insight around that. I can see anecdotally, and

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.500
I've mentioned this before. It's worth mentioning again. I am getting to a spot in my

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.500
idea generation, and typically that comes out in talks I give. But I love it that when I start

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.660
talking about modern testing or aspects of modern testing or where I want to go,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.300
I see head nods. Yeah, I could see that happening, or I'm doing that, I'm living that,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.020
and then looks of horror from others. And I love being in that pocket because it feels

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.500
like it's the right place to push things forward.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.180
Test Bash is coming up soon for you.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.100
Test Bash is in March. I'm sure I'll mention that again, but I'm excited about that,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.500
where I will talk about the adventures in modern testing.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:06.680
I'm wondering if there's a heuristic here where you can just start recording after you do a

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.280
conference on this topic. You start recording so that the rough percentage of head nods versus

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.840
shocks looking you get from the audience, obviously you got to do your presentations,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.520
so you got to do this fast.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.840
I should work something in. I don't like presentations that go,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.120
how many of you agree with this? How many of you don't? So I have to kind of gauge it,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:35.320
but I will give you a ratio where I see of head nods versus looks of horror from the crowd.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.680
I will try and figure that out.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:47.910
I presented last Friday internally, and yeah, so I guess this is not going to be an ADHD-free

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.790
podcast today.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.190
Never is.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.710
Even though we're limited in time.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.510
Not with Brent.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.150
I, on the other hand, am laser focused.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.970
I got to say, so like a robot, all of us sort of have this, uh, a laser focused robot.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.430
Go on, Brent.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.880
Yeah, now I'm pulling up episode 60s metaphor with the squirrel on the bus with the hat and

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.840
the elephant thing.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.960
So did a presentation on a very similar one to the one I did for Unity.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.000
I had to generalize the context.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
This time it was a lot more around,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.000
Hey, we're, we're a data team just starting up.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.570
You know, what have you learned in terms of how to create a data driven culture?

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.860
They had invited other talks to there.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.180
And I know you admit to this.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.220
I think it's a human condition, but a lot of the time that I go through when I do these

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.660
presentations is just pushing down and rejecting and ignoring

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.420
everything.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.700
My gut is saying, uh, around imposter syndrome.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.520
Like, Oh my God, there are actual people here who just did another presentation.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.520
They know what they're talking about.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.920
And then, and then it, uh, but this last presentation, it got me.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.120
It got me.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.600
I like, I was like, wait a minute.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.320
No, I've actually done everything I'm saying in here.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.320
I started losing confidence in there.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.440
Just the worst freaking presentation.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.760
I have done in recent past.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.690
Bummer.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.010
Yeah.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:34.610
So the good thing for me is like to 30 people is that I literally know nothing.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:41.570
I am the pure imposter, but I also believe in the fake it till you make it, uh, statement.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.770
So that's, that is really how I do things.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.610
I look at stuff and there's a man tangent exception.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.610
I was having a conversation with someone recently about how

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:58.080
LinkedIn skills are bizarre.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.440
Like I'm endorsed for things I've never done before.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.690
Oh, it's like, Oh wow.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:10.370
I wonder if I should be an expert in that, but I'm just, I hate it.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.770
All right.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:16.960
I'm going to rewind and get us onto the topic of the day, which is what Alan?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.280
Which is, which is a mailbag question.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.840
It's a what?

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:27.110
I think I did mention that I've retired, uh, due to a pending lawsuit from Nickelodeon

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.790
over use of the blues clues, mailbag theme.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.070
And my, am I, am I miss desire to sing the mailbag song anymore?

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.710
What?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.950
I am, I am, I am done.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.830
I have moved on from the mail.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.910
If someone wants to send in a great sound bite thing, I'll use it, but I'm not singing

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.190
mailbag anymore.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.200
Oh, we're not doing a damn mailbag.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.270
I've just ruined the 75.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.990
I mean, that's fantastic.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.670
I mean, it's, this clearly signals the beginning of the end of the podcast.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.590
For a new step in maturity.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.540
Yeah.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:16.020
So we're quickly moving into now we're going to be news anchors sort of reporting out and reading

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:16.740
scripts.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.060
Oh my God.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:25.140
I totally, I totally disagree and I don't understand why I wasn't called in.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.620
Okay.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.020
On this.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.140
We'll, we'll take a vote from the three.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.660
Maybe I don't know what to do here today.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.460
I'm not singing it.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.300
I'm making a stand and I will, I'm, I'm happy to experiment.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.340
This is an experiment.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.020
They pro Nickelodeon stand.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.420
I am going to do an AB test.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.380
Wait, are they, are they a hidden sponsor that you haven't told me about?

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.260
They're not.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.380
I am doing an AB test in two different as an experiment and for the AB testing audience.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.940
There's no mailbag song today.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.980
I can't believe you spent three minutes talking about this.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:04.420
This is important and I'm positive the three will echo my opinion.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:11.060
I'm positive the three will say that this segment is just as valuable without

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.380
a little reverb up mailbag things stolen directly from blues clues.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.030
So Tony Gutierrez asks,

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.270
there's been a lot of talk on the podcast about starting a community for testers and

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.670
testers not having to report to a tester for a manager.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.350
The issue I see is lots of stuff will go dissect here.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.510
The issue I see at my current job is that many of the testers do not see the need

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.310
for a community or aren't engaged and seem to want to be spoon fed.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.070
Any tips on how to get the testers more engaged or starting a community from scratch.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.110
And in rereading this question, I realize that we don't have enough time to cover

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.070
everything.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.590
All the nuance in here.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:02.950
There's a lot of nuance in here and so what I want to do, you take point.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.510
I'll follow you.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:08.070
What I want to do is I want to talk about community a little bit and then I'm going

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:12.710
to go back because there's more to Tony's question than just community.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.800
So the part I thought I thought I thought I got to take point, but go ahead.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.360
No, you did.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:27.760
I'll just add in here the part of this that I have experienced and I have just found a challenge

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.360
is sort of the phrase you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:39.190
There's getting getting testers engaged is the hard problem.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:46.920
And I would say in a nutshell, I have not found a great solution for driving.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.880
And I have not found a better solution for driving engagement from I'll call the

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.680
resistant than creating a logical argument that constructs fear.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.320
Great.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.720
So let's put a pin in that because that's the part I wanted to come back to after we

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.160
talked about community.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.560
Done.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.640
I want to talk about community first.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.040
Go ahead.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.380
This commune.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.500
God, why do we do this?

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:21.600
So we have talked in the podcast about community and early on in my it's interesting when I give

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.680
this talk on adventures in modern testing and this is tangent deception because I'm going back.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.080
I talk about the last projects I've worked on and what I've learned from them.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.640
And there was a time that largely overlap with my time in Xbox.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.960
It kind of began before that where actually it began way back in engineering excellence

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:47.680
where I began to leverage community across Microsoft for my own growth.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.720
I again, I fake it till I make it.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.560
I didn't know much, but I knew people who knew a lot and the community became across

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.800
the company became very important for my growth.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:05.760
So in that I ended up at one point like the orange one in the US owning the house,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.760
the Senate and the executive branch.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.440
I was the chair of the Microsoft test leadership team.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:18.000
I ran Microsoft test architect group senior individual contributors and I also ran our

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.040
cross company quality and testing experts community run out of our TC or technical

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.800
community network organization.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.360
So I had all kinds of community and they overlap and I figured out how they how they

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.480
fed each other and I put a lot not a lot all three of those things you were.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.600
Yeah, you were my wow you I see a way you left the role.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.760
I mean, that's a clear sign of technical errors on your part.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.640
Yeah, what else?

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.520
But so that was that was value for my career.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.910
But then when I was on Xbox, I learned the value of mostly in hindsight,

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.110
the value of community of different kinds of communities.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:04.470
And one was, as I've mentioned before, and I like this example, I ran.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.910
I was asked to run a tools organization in Xbox.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.390
I said, I don't want to run a tools org for lots of reasons.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.710
Why mainly focused around Microsoft's competitive stack ranking and how tools

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.150
teams often were left out of those things.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:20.710
I didn't want to be part of that, but I did run our Xbox tools

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.470
like an open source project.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.430
Two of us contributing the most one contributing much more than me, but

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:31.430
looping in as many as 20 or 30 different people around the org to contribute tools

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.030
that we used org wise many of many of those tools still being used today.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:42.630
It's exciting to hear and then also starting to build a community of I had no one reporting to me,

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.270
but I sort of ran the community of the test organization for my manager.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.760
So we had in Xbox the typical of a separate functional test organization.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:16:00.600
And my manager's job was to run the run the business of that group and attend meetings and

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.000
all the things that typical test director does.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.800
And I ran the community pretty much.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.920
I made sure people were connected.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.120
I sent out newsletters.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.520
I made sure they made sure people were connected.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.560
People who needed it had mentors, spun up sub communities as needed.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.600
And it made me realize again in hindsight that a functional test organization that the typical

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:27.650
test organization is kind of a community, but it can be a community.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:36.370
So when I came to Unity, I as my test team, my team were all embedded

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.850
everywhere across the org around the world.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:46.130
I will actually just interrupt you and say there is a lot of value in the communities

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.490
period.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.610
I can go on examples.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.130
I have a great one just yesterday.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.530
I don't think there's anything special about test.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.330
No, that test gains a benefit from form of the community.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.050
And I hope I did not imply that.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.290
Okay.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:08.290
I think as the three know, I am a huge fan of Philip Armour's orders of ignorance.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:08.610
Yep.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:13.570
And without recapping those, I think communities are a wonderful method to discover what you don't

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:13.810
know.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.850
You don't know.

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.090
They facilitate learning and discovery.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.330
Yep.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.690
And I'm really happy about that.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.570
As I got to Unity and discovered that what I really did was a community leader, I started

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.690
thinking more about it.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:30.530
And then for some reasons, probably thinking about what the overlap was between Agile testing

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.810
and modern testing, I reread the Crispin Gregory book on Agile testing.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.090
And I came across this paragraph.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.540
There are reasons for having a QA manager and an independent test team.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.620
However, we suggest changing the reasons as well as the structure.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.660
Rather than keeping the testers separate as an independent team to test the application

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.820
after coding, which we hate, which we hate with my part.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.780
Think about the team as a community of testers.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.060
Provide a learning organization.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.060
I'm going, yes, I could have written this line.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.220
Provide a learning organization to help your testers with career development and a place

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.300
to share ideas and help each other.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.180
If the QA manager becomes a practice leader in the organization, that person will be able

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.100
to teach the skills that testers need to become stronger and better able to cope with

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:26.340
the ever changing environment, which very much describes what I do to an extent.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.860
But I think there's more than just being the practice leader.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.740
I take other skills of community and try and get people to

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.540
connect and share ideas with each other.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.900
We do a weekly newsletter.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.140
My job, I feel like a big part of my job is to help everyone on my team.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.540
Discover what they don't know, they don't know, and make it become something they know

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.860
and share those practices with each other.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:53.380
So I got off track a little bit talking about my history of community, but there's a maturity there.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:58.100
A community, I don't want to call this a maturity model because I haven't thought it through yet,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.600
but I think a community starts with, like right now, I am needed to keep it going.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.800
If I left, the community would maybe continue.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:13.280
We're a little, sometimes if a leader leaves a community, the community just stops.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.440
And I've seen that happen with all those communities.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.560
Some end it for other reasons.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.400
Have I shared with you the metaphor around the difference between the spider and the starfish?

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.400
Yes, I'm very much aware of the spider and the starfish.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.200
There's a book, I think, called The Spider and the Starfish.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.560
And if you have, there is.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.520
Which I've read.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.440
And it's fantastic, and it's relevant.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:38.840
It is.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.200
Do you want to expand on it so I can stop talking for a minute?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.240
The spider and the starfish?

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.120
It's worth it.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.760
Sure.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.360
I think we may have talked about it before.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.880
I know I've blogged about it before.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.240
We have new listeners.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.360
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.320
We can dive in.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.040
This is worthwhile and relevant to the conversation.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.480
Is this the year?

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.600
Yeah, there's a strategy.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.720
When we say we've talked about it before, it was earlier in the same episode,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.520
then we're in trouble.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.000
Yeah, no, there's a strategy.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.240
I once talked with James Whittaker on this, and I'm like,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.920
I don't know how pissed he'll be for me sharing this.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.140
But essentially, one of his later test books, I'm like,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:23.570
dude, except for the certain way you skin this content,

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:29.170
this is exactly the same book as the one you wrote five years ago.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.890
And he looked at me, he smiled, he was like,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.480
the problems haven't changed.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.400
You scam artist.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.880
Anyway.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.080
Spider and the Starfish, Brent.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.560
Oh, sorry.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.040
Please recap.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.760
Yep.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.880
Spider and Starfish.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.040
Think of it as a metaphor.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.720
Primarily, the difference between a spider and a starfish,

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.320
if you kind of squint your eyes and look at a third-year-old's drawing,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.720
is a spider has a head.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.920
Starfish doesn't.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:12.390
Fun fact, the current science on starfish is that they actually believe

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:18.200
that each leg of a starfish has its own brain.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.640
And that's actually for things like how the starfish moves.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.320
One leg convinces the other legs to move this way.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:33.300
So when you have the sense that you know that the community will die once you leave,

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.460
I mean, it's a clear spider.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.700
It's a great book, Spider and Starfish.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.580
I usually go into a longer metaphor.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.980
We don't have time for today on this.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:51.620
But I will say, in my time in Xbox, I created a community model

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:59.540
that leveraged the principles of spider and starfish.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:08.950
And after about three months of me as the head of the spider encouraging it to go,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.430
I got it to self-sustain.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.670
The reason why it died?

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.350
A reorg.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.490
So, one, and I'll recap that.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.970
I think you can think of the spider as the leader-led organization

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.930
and the starfish as the leaderless organization.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.610
More of an independent.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:30.420
Yeah.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.000
Well, I mean, in the subtitle of the book, they call it, I just double-checked.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
It's like the starfish and the spider, blah, blah, blah, leaderless organization.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.760
It is absolutely not leaderless.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.520
But yeah, I get that.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.000
Yeah.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.400
So, it's managerless.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.080
Community.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.440
I think the problem with a leader, a spider, or a leader-led,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.960
a spider, or a leader-led, a functional test organization,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.620
if the leader leaves, it's gone, right?

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.580
Like I said with the reorg.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.060
That's it.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.420
I lost my train of thought there for a second, but a leader-filled,

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.020
a spider can never be self-sustaining.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.510
A spider organization.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.270
It can't self-sustain.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.790
It can't keep going on its own.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:18.950
No.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.550
It needs the head.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.760
Anyway, so Unity, everybody everywhere,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:32.280
community, I think some parts of my organization are either self-sustaining now or could be.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.640
Some are not even close, and that's okay.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.050
I think I still feel like a large part of my goal is to get there.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:45.730
So, now I want to, so that's sort of lost track here with Brant's hyperactive leg.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.330
Now, it stopped.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.730
Good.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.730
I thought it was like a dog.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.090
Something is tail on the floor.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.730
I am actively not fidgeting with the microphone.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.170
If you would just get your crap together, where did my notes go?

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:06.050
I want to go back to Tony's question, and then maybe in the last 15, 20 minutes we have here

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:13.010
at the most, I want to go through his point sentence by sentence and talk a little bit more

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.410
about those.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.410
And I think some of this stuff is going to have to bleed over to another episode.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.730
Ping us with your questions on Twitter or in the Slack group, because I do want to dive into a lot.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.490
I think this is an important discussion.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:34.850
Take a pause, and without reading Tony's thing, what do you think is the primary theme that he's

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.050
trying to look for a solution?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.920
Is it community building?

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.800
No, it's not.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.720
I wanted to start with that.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:49.400
I think Tony has a disengaged test team, or he's talking about one, who are not, they don't

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.080
have the growth and hunger and seeking that you and I look for in people we want in these

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.880
organizations.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.640
I think my hunch is he's talking about how do you take people who really aren't into this,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:08.120
they just want to do their thing, and make them people who want to engage in a community.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:15.280
There's a lot of jumps here, because I feel like Tony could be over analyzing or Tony

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:22.230
could be over dramatizing, but what do you do with people who just aren't right for the job?

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.550
I don't even know if that's part of the problem, but we can, I agree.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.150
And maybe that could be a little bit too deep there, but I'll put it a different way.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:36.260
One of the things I look for, people I hire and people I want to grow and promote or keep

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.580
in my organization, is a hunger to learn.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.100
People who want to learn new things and are interested and think that it's important for

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:49.620
their own growth and self-sustainment, they actively seek out things like communities in

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:56.080
order to learn, and when they don't, when they shun the community, when they think they

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.120
can figure it out by themselves versus leverage others to get their work done, then I think

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.720
they have growth problems or other issues that I want to nip in the bud.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:18.740
You know what? I'm going to invent a poll for you. What is more important? You solving

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.710
the problem or you solving the problem?

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.850
If I interpret correctly, what's more important to me is the problem is solved.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.550
Okay.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.550
So the first one in your emphasis.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:44.480
Right. Now, you may have noticed that those words were exactly the same.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:46.310
Yes.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.950
Right? It's an ambiguous statement around what is the important principle.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.790
And so I think one of the things that leaders in this space need to do

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:04.900
is don't leave it up to interpretation as to from that statement what is the order

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.940
of importance of the principles. One of the problems when I, for example, one of the

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:16.900
problems I have with people who come aboard and join my team, my team operates as a mini

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:25.200
community. And what is a community? Community is what I think of community. It is a vehicle

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.440
to scale knowledge sharing. I don't care. Like some people may think, hey, a community is

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.410
getting people together. Let's talk stuff. But if you're doing that and it's not a

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:43.270
vehicle for knowledge sharing, I did. Sure. By the definition, it may be a community, but

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:51.700
it's useless to me. And there's a new kid that's been on my team for about six months.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:58.580
And he's got signs that what I've been trying to get him to do and what I'm trying to get

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:05.540
him to understand has finally clicked. And now shit's happening and it's love it.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:12.720
But I'm like, look, dude, you need to have faith in the rest of your teammates. They're not here

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:19.800
to compete with you. They're here to help you succeed. Trust me. Try it out. Because there's the

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.640
That sounds so un-Microsoft.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:28.900
I know. It's actually one of my success, sadly, successful strategies to keep people on my team.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.420
Because we operate a different way and they know that they give it up if they leave.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:42.050
But he repeatedly would show up in retrospective. And one of the things that we talk about in

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:47.890
retrospective, we will go, what was the latest ticket? What ticket took the most calendar time?

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:52.390
And that's the one we always talk about. And for like two months in a row, it was him.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.620
He got tired of it. And then in retrospective, we were like, yeah, you could have cut this

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:01.060
ticket in half if you just went over and asked that person, how do you do this?

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:08.440
Yeah, I even have a without naming any names. One of the one of my teams as a little bit of

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:15.170
all by myself syndrome. That's what the problem was when you started. So I can do it.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:23.250
So it's a critical. It's a it's a everything's critical. It's an important component that the

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:30.930
whole company will use. And the team, for some legitimate reasons, and many non legitimate reasons,

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:36.530
did a lot of things by themselves instead of leveraging the community of the company around

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:42.930
them to help them. And it slowed them down. Things are back on track. Wasn't a horrible leap in the

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:48.550
wrong direction. But you have to leverage those around you. They got a little stuck in a. It's

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.670
a long story. I thought I won't share any details, but I'll just let that out.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.950
I like the definition of community and I want to touch on your so a feeling of fellowship with

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:03.030
others as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests and goals. That's off of Webster. And

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:08.790
what I think you want from the community, which is I want to is we want people who leverage the

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:15.350
power of that. Yes. And many people are and what Tony talks about people that are there's

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:20.150
that community is there that that textbook definition there, but they don't really care

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:27.110
about leveraging the power of that community. And I think in knowledge work, you have to leverage

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:35.700
the power of your community. If you are not learning constantly in your role, perhaps you are

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:42.180
doing the wrong thing. Yeah, I'm going to just say just two points quick and then I'll let you

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:49.080
have the final word. Sure, you will. All right. Number one, and when you start with this, it's

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.880
going to be a spider thing for sure. Right? Because what you have to do is change people's

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.640
behavior and they're not going to do it naturally. You have to gently guide the expected behavior,

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.280
which means you be proactive and clear on the principles and what you're looking to see.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:11.160
And you incentivize it. Now, incentivization doesn't mean you give bonuses for people who

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.320
share because you're going to get the wrong behavior then. But praise goes a long way.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:26.440
The second thing, as a leader, so I've been doing this for a long time. So I know how to

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:37.990
get new ideas, right? We've quoted Johnson repeatedly. New ideas come from old ideas

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:44.950
getting together. This is, in addition to knowledge sharing, this is a huge value out

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:54.710
in community. But brainstorming of this sort in a community fashion is not second nature to most

00:31:54.710 --> 00:32:00.790
people. While we're on Johnson, there's a relevant quote here from the same book. Chance favors

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:08.610
the connected mind. For sure. And just like shivers and that's like I want to make a poster.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:14.130
This is why community is important. Chance favors the connected mind. So one of the things

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:23.030
there's one of my very favorite techniques on this that I've blogged on

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:31.190
was the speed dating process. Right? You basically look in and this helps the

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:34.870
introverts. Like you like, okay, you got two problems. I'm not going to describe it here.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:40.390
We're almost out of time. Find my blog post. Maybe Alan will remember and link to it.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:48.610
Probably not. But here's an example that I went through just yesterday, two days ago.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:56.420
I have a problem. I know how to solve it. But I went and had lunch with a peer of mine

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:03.080
who I know is somewhat connected to it. And I said, hey, how would you solve it?

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:15.700
Now, one of the things, there's a lot of talent in all of these companies. But there's this

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:21.540
phenomenon that's true for everybody. If the only tool you know how to use is a hammer,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:28.040
every problem is going to look like a nail. Now, another way of saying that, that's probably

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:36.790
more positive, is you're going to solve the problems with the tools you know how to use.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:45.520
That doesn't mean it's the only way to solve the problem. So I asked him his solution and he said,

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:52.400
oh, I would do this, this, and that, and this. And I look back and I'm like, oh my god, your

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:58.610
solution not only would solve my problem in about half the time, I would be able to add

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:06.070
these additional experiences. That's way better. A simple community kick starting type of thing

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:12.530
on this front would be get people together, form them into the roundtables, and say, I want you

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:18.900
guys, here's a big problem. How would you guys solve the problem? How would you guys solve the

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:24.370
problem? How would you guys solve this problem? Force them to work together towards a common

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.130
goal. And they're going to connect the dots within that little table. And then when you

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:33.940
tell them to present outwards, a bigger, better solution is going to become clear.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.720
Which is interesting. You mentioned that because one thing I saw at Microsoft frequently was the

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.600
opposite of that. They would charter three different teams with solving the same problem

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.800
and have them compete against each other to see which one could solve it better.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.360
And I believe that this solution you just described would, in hindsight for many of us,

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:01.760
been a much better solution. I do want to cover at least one sentence. I think it's very important

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:07.520
from Tony's question. It's really not even the question part. A lot of talk on the podcast about

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.040
starting a community for testers and testers not having to report to a tester for a manager.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.600
While I do have people in my, I have leads in my org who currently work for,

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:26.640
directly for development directors. Very shortly I will have some individual contributors on my team

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:36.000
move to work directly for development leads. But you and I both watched at Microsoft. Most teams,

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:44.420
most teams did this combined engineering thing, not unified combined. And it didn't go smoothly.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.620
Eventually it ironed out. But they didn't go smoothly because the support and infrastructure

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:56.340
and community wasn't there to support this. What I think is really important is I fully believe that

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.620
Well, not only that, even in-house leadership wasn't there to support it.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:06.500
So I fully believe that the most efficient way to make software is to not only not have an

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:12.500
independent test team, but to not have a specific person assigned to doing only testing. That person

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:18.340
ends up being a bottleneck. I fully subscribe to the theory of constraints. And I believe in the

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.460
test and quality specialist on the team, just as you'd have any other sort of specialist,

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.220
they're going to pick up more of those tasks, but they're also going to make everyone around

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.860
them better testers just as a perf expert or a database expert would do for their feature team.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.420
That requires building a community that not only includes a supportive and self-sustaining

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:44.260
community that not only includes or largely self-sustaining, not only includes the testing

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:49.220
and quality experts, but the development team and the management and the leadership of that team.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.900
You know what the key difference actually, the key difference between a combined

00:36:52.900 --> 00:37:00.360
engineering and unified engineering. What is it? Is it a team of specialists or is it a team of

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:06.560
T-shaped? Very much could be. I like that. So the T-shaped persona, you can look it up.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:13.830
We've talked about it before. Lost track of where I was, but you only, I will only move

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:20.390
people to move to work for directly for dev leads when the community, the community leadership,

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:26.290
the whole infrastructure, the community of community supports it. Even so, I would expect

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:35.010
me at some point to get to a place in my career at unity when I have nobody reporting directly to

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:42.690
me as far as the HR solid line show, but I will still run that community for some time.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:48.050
It's a very gradual process. Like right now it's a process in transition. It will take me

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:53.730
a shorter time in some groups and a longer time in some groups, but I can definitely see a place

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:59.010
somewhere down the line, not even going to put a time limit on it, when I could have people

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:04.450
work, everyone working for the dev leads. And even at that point, I think there's still some

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:12.440
work for me to do to slowly back off on my involvement in making that community run.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:18.100
I think I love a line from Brent. Sometimes he's going to rip off the band-aid, but be careful

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:24.660
because sometimes it's a tourniquet. And I think a gradual withdrawal as I watch and make sure

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:30.130
the community is going to self-sustain and when it's not dive back in and make sure it is and

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:34.930
do a little bit of that bouncing, a little yo-yoing in until I'm positive that community

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:39.650
is self-sustaining. And at that point, maybe I'm also transitioning and doing something else

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:44.610
at Unity. Things change so fast, I'm sure there will be, if my boss is listening, a role for me.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:54.180
There's another great quote on that in that, hire the people that automate their job away

00:38:55.410 --> 00:39:03.840
and then give them another job. It's well known. And just connecting the dots from the podcast,

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.680
I now actually realize with greater clarity, we've always agreed that this is what you're doing

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.800
and we don't know the timeline. But now with greater clarity, I understand what you're doing.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:22.340
You are using your position as the head of the spider to turn this organ into a starfish.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.380
Sure. That's 100% what you're doing. It is crystal clear in my mind now.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:34.880
I'm doing a biology experiment. So the point I want to make clear to Tony and anyone else

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:41.360
listening, thinking about, oh, A, B testing says, and modern testing says we should have all of our

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:53.670
testers report to development leads. While true, kind of, only make that change when the community

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:59.350
and the leadership and when the organization is ready for that. And your job as a leader

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:04.470
is to help make the team ready for that and be successful in doing that.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:10.630
I love this metaphor. I'm sorry, because I now actually realize the problem with even greater

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:17.440
clarity, because if you're busy trying to remove the head and transform into a starfish,

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:25.600
it does not help your, your, we'll call it legs. If they move from you to a new spider.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:30.900
Yes. So I think we're going to dive into this a little bit more.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:38.420
