WEBVTT

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.230
Hey everybody, I'm Alan.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.070
And I'm Brent.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.270
And we're here for episode, are we on,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.390
what number are we on, Snowman?

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.230
Eight, I think.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.020
Eight, I call that number Snowman.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.860
I understand.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.380
All right, when I used to golf a long time ago,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.880
when I was younger and stupider

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.560
and had way more free time,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.660
and every time I got an eight on a hole,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.620
instead of crying or feeling bad,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.060
I just called it a snowman and I felt good.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.480
Random Alan Trivia.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.160
I have nothing to say to this.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.720
Random, random, random, random.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.080
All right, so, you ready to get going?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.920
I am.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.400
Well, let's look at the agenda for today.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.480
We have a bunch of stuff,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.280
or maybe not much at all, we'll find out.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.360
In our last podcast, I cut Brent off

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.200
because I didn't want to hear about his IRR thing.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.000
But this week, maybe I want to hear more about it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.840
So I thought we'd just start off

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.200
and let him finish his thoughts on there

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.250
while we are guaranteed to have some time.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.330
So one of the problems,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.890
let me start off with the problem.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.740
As we move into this new world,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.100
one of the issues that people are facing

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.860
is we have this new review model

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.500
where we're kind of judged on three different things.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.900
One is how awesome we are individually,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.260
how awesome we were at listening

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.820
and incorporating other people's ideas,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.380
and then how awesome we were around taking our ideas

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.940
and helping others with them.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.060
And we, me, as of course, Microsoft,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.820
and I wonder how much, is that the HR guidance?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.220
It is. Those things.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.100
Well, maybe with a little less awesome.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.540
Little less awesome sauce.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.620
I haven't heard that as much.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.980
I wonder if it's as transparent

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.580
or as clear across the company.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.860
Just a side little editorial comment.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.500
Just with the people that I've talked to.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.300
You saw from my values a couple podcasts ago

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.420
that when we talked about those,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.220
is I'm really big into transparency

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.100
and let people know exactly what you care about.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.620
And I think if we could get, that's the right mix.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.580
We get that into everybody's head

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.340
and they kind of get it, the right things will happen.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.380
Because in the past, as you know,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.700
it was all about being, the rewards

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.380
was all about being awesome yourself,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.700
no matter who you crapped on along the way.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.880
Right.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.680
And as long as that awesomeness you did

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.840
was something that management remembered.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.740
Peak in May, he used to be.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.460
Right. That was exactly right.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.580
So Alan and I have talked about one thing

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.690
that one of our big competitors do.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.250
And that is every week on Friday,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.460
everybody in the company writes a status report

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.820
that gets submitted into this giant index

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.020
that anyone can read.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.770
So it, it, it.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.490
Not only can anyone read, but it's searchable.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.330
Right.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.810
I wonder if anybody else is stuck on this same,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.210
you know, linked to SQL issue that I am.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.770
I mean, and here, here's four people working on this.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.930
Oh, cool.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.290
And so what, one of the things that that does

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.530
is it really makes it easy for people

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.410
to find other people who have similar passions.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.450
So if there's something, so Alan mentioned a problem,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.330
but let's say there's something big.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.360
I want to create a small little niche book site.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.360
I wonder if anyone else in the company

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.880
might be interested in working with me.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.160
He gives me the ability to kind of search through that index

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.120
and then find a name that I could reach out to.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.000
Okay.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Now, one of the, one of the things that I realized

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.080
very recently, because my strategy to try to influence

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.360
this company to do something similar

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.140
was basically talking to any and everybody that would listen.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.950
And then I realized just a couple of weeks ago,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.790
wait a minute, we already probably have that asset.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.500
Just no one's using it in that way.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.020
I will start.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.860
This is where-

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.140
Trailblazer Brent.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.100
That's right.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.380
This is where the IRR idea came from.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.380
What it stands for is an individual retrospective report.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.500
Okay.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.900
And then I just communicated it with my team.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.620
Give me a moment to ponder.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.460
The name sucks.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.260
But what I'm trying to do is this is something

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.780
that I want every week and it is not a status report.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.820
Do you go to them and go, yeah,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.140
we're gonna need your IRR report.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.100
Yeah.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.180
Yeah.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.500
And if you could bring some donuts on the way

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.580
and that'd be great.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.100
Yeah.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.140
I don't know about our four or five.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.820
How many listeners do we think we have now?

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.940
I think we lost a couple.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.020
Anyway, go on.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.300
Yeah.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.620
I just don't do passive aggressive very well.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.980
It's not, not winding back to a nutshell.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.170
Okay.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.420
The biggest value of our competitor,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.380
putting all their status reports

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.560
into the central store that's searchable.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.480
When you mentioned status reports at this company,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.600
what it generally means, it's pain, bureaucracy,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.360
and some jerk wads somewhere is trying to use this

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.600
to create a paper trail so that they can hold me accountable

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.200
for things that they don't understand.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.040
Yeah.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.240
I fricking hate status reports.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.920
I had to write, you know, the story like three months ago,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.160
I was interacting with this team

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.480
and they wanted everyone to write on this sort of

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.960
virtual team to write status reports.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.480
So people would write pages.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.670
I would write two bullet points.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.710
Like one of them was.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.030
Done, not done.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.630
The first one I did, one of my accomplishments was,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.950
wrote my first status report in 15 years.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.670
Actually, Alan forwarded that to me.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.070
It was a great giggle.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.990
You see why we didn't talk about this last time,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.940
why there wasn't enough time.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.140
There was plenty of time.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.780
I was on a roll at that point in time.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.740
Now I'm, now what are you, now you're like,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.580
I'm like coffee's not working.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.380
You're like a square wheel trying to roll down the hill.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.340
Trying to roll up a hill.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.780
On its own.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.740
An IRR's purpose, and yes it will undergo a name change,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.340
but in the short term it's not a status report.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.380
Go on.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.180
Its purpose is to fish.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.660
What I'm trying to do with it,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.660
is make my team easy to find for people who go in search.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.880
And the type of people that I want

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.280
to reduce that friction towards,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.960
is the ones where they have a solution

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.940
for a problem that we're facing,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.540
or we have a solution for a problem they are facing.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.980
I don't have a problem on my team.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.620
My entire team is awesome on individual contribution,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.820
but we do a lot of collaboration,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.340
and we spend a lot of time talking about,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.860
man we know that this expertise exists,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.770
how do we find them?

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.930
Well one way to do that is make yourself easy to find.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.370
Yeah I think as a side note,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.330
the editorial comment is,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.530
almost every problem I run into,

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.130
I stop and think surely someone has solved this before.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.130
Then the challenge is,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.570
how do I find that right connection?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.890
Especially now I'm not working with a lot of

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.010
widely used tools.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.730
Yep.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.850
So right now we will iterate over it,

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.930
and when I laid it out to my team,

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.170
I said I laid down a baseline in terms of the content

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.150
I wanted to contain.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.290
Just four items,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.250
it's essentially what sorts of things are you working on?

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.110
What problems are you facing

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.310
that others might be able to help you with?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.090
What sorts of things,

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.910
what sort of solutions do you think you've now done

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:24.950
in this last week,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.430
that others might be able to capitalize?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.910
And then are there any critical learnings

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.540
for knowledge sharing?

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.420
Hey I learned that this is a really bad way

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.660
to try to solve this problem.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.310
Things like that.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.590
And that'll be our first baseline,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.670
I told the team.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.790
Have you done one yet?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.630
No.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.470
Oh.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.740
This is all theoretical.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.400
It's all.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.580
Unimplemented.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.760
Not yet fully started.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.600
The first set.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.160
Half baked idea living in Brent's head.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.000
No, it's already rolled out to the team.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.200
All right, it's fully baked.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.200
It's already rolled out to the team.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.800
They will start this today.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.760
No, I'm teasing you,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.720
but I like the idea.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.840
And I think as long as you keep it short,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.680
to the point,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.910
it's almost like the stand up.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.490
Let me see if this analogy works.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.550
The status report meeting is to the scrum stand up

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.100
as the written status report is to the IRR.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.340
Yes.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.380
Oh, I'm good.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.500
Yes.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.660
So the other thing too is,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.920
I've already told the team,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.800
I don't know what this prize will be,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.300
but we will reward people who figure out

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.940
the right format that decreases the time it takes

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.190
for people to find us.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.030
Right?

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.730
It's, I mentioned it's like fishing.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.710
Well, we got to find the right bait.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.350
We can't just throw empty hooks out.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.750
Probably won't work.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.300
The other thing too is,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.380
I want the team to figure out how to adjust this format

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.740
so that anyone can do it within 15 minutes.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.640
It-

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.140
I was going to ask how long it should take.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:08.980
I would,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.300
I would expect it would take less than 15 minutes.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.140
In fact,

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.300
Yeah, but you're a brilliant writer.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.260
What you take 15 minutes to do

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.700
generally takes me four hours.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.060
The point is,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.220
regardless of the brilliant or non-brilliant

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.250
level of the writer,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.770
it doesn't have to be perfect.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.460
It's learning.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.300
It doesn't.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.380
The point is,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.900
if you are good at search foo,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.140
if you are good at typing in,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.540
figuring out,

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.620
you have to ask some really crazy question,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.020
finding the right search terms to find,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.980
to get the hit,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.180
you probably are able to write a very good IRR

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.320
because what you're trying to write

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.970
is what you did in searchable terms.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.890
Right?

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.730
Don't use big words,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.930
use small words.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.770
Use-

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.330
And use-

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.570
Well-known-

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.210
Well-known words.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.330
World, you're right.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.970
So there's a little bit of an art to it,

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.490
but it shouldn't be quick.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.370
You don't want to write Hemingway.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.210
You want,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.850
you're asking for not very many bullet points.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.450
It's for a week, so.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.450
So the,

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.290
we're gonna,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.970
we have a public Yammer group already in place.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.570
I'm gonna follow your Yammer group.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.610
Anyone can,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.250
anyone can join it.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:25.450
I've made it as easy as possible

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.070
for people to get aboard.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.940
And the value of this,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.020
at least me and my team,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.340
is not theoretical.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.780
I did a different version of this.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.520
I had a community alias about a year ago,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.480
and I let people join whenever they wanted.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.960
And suddenly people who I had no idea who they were,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.920
started joining.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.100
I'm like,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.620
okay, if they get value out of it,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.660
knock themselves out.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.100
Was this an email alias?

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.420
It was an email distribution.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.980
Did you call it free beer?

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.020
No, I called it,

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.270
it's Power BI telemetry community.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.470
Okay, so it's around.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.630
Anyway, go on.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.470
They worked as a-

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.310
People joined.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.150
They did.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.990
You know why?

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.790
People are desperate for information.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.430
Because I used the T word.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.270
The T word.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.310
Software design engineering telemetry.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.900
Yeah, it means everything and nothing right now.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.260
Within,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.900
once that event's out occurring,

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.660
people who I didn't know who they were,

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.500
started joining.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.340
Within three weeks,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.060
I got an email from a guy.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.980
Hey, it seems like you're beginning to work on this problem.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.580
Were you aware that me and my team

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.430
already have a fully operationalized data warehouse

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.530
for that exact problem?

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.440
To which I respond,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.780
no, I was not.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.940
When shall we meet?

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.180
And that ended up being a great partnership.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.500
And it shrunk easily four months off of my schedule.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.310
Yeah, I think one way to find that often,

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.310
because we don't have a good way of discovering

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.910
what we don't know, we don't know,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.590
or what other people are doing right now,

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.430
I think often the best way,

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.430
at least in my experience,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.270
at our company,

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.550
the best way to find out if someone else

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.850
is working on a particular project or item or a problem

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.690
is to say that you are working on solving

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.650
that particular problem or project.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.290
And then the person who's,

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.210
people that are also working on it

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.740
will pop out of the woodwork.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.090
Yes.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.090
It's just funny.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.710
There's got to be a better way.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.630
So a lot of people,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.950
what they try to do is

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.870
try to solve this problem proactively.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.910
I'm gonna have,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.230
Alan, you are now,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.670
whether or not you are an expert,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.230
you are now the expert on

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.560
natural language programming.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.400
We're all doomed.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.780
Just so that everyone,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.060
so that I can send a mail out to the whole world

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.620
and let everyone know,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.100
Alan is now the expert.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.860
He will take care of all of these questions.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.460
That doesn't help.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.900
Really what I'm trying to do is say,

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.940
hey, proactive is one aspect,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.300
but how do I shrink reactive?

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.420
I know I'm struggling with finding people.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.740
I know Alan has this problem now and again.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.660
Alan has a fantastic people network

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.940
and a lot of people know this and leverage it.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.070
I think we've talked before.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.750
I have a half written Think Week paper.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.510
I never finished it.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.070
I didn't know where it is anymore.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.630
Gosh, I might have lost it in a hard drive crash,

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.030
but I've called on this concept of,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.020
if only Microsoft knew what Microsoft knew.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.860
Right.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.140
So I like the IRR idea because I think it's a great,

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.420
it's a method for discovering

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.500
what you don't know, you don't know,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.180
for discovering, for making those connections.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.540
What, when Steven Johnson,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.940
author talks about where good ideas come from.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.260
One of the things it needs is a network.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.140
You need great ideas or most often

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.420
a connection between other ideas.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.540
And those ideas need a real network

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.180
to swim in and define connections.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.940
So anything that provides that network,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.900
whether it's searchable terms,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.690
sorry, I was thinking through Yammer,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.090
how do you filter through,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.130
I guess if you're just searching that one group,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.690
I don't know, I'd figure how to use Yammer

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.570
for this technology, but for a company wide thing.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.410
You just go to the top and you hit search.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.890
I know, but there's so much other,

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.170
there's technical groups and there's social groups on Yammer

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.810
and I'll have to see how search works

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.010
and I want to look for.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.130
So one question,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:46.130
because Alan is a much better Yammer-er than I,

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.330
so you said you're gonna join my group.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.470
Do you know, I didn't give you the name,

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.550
does that block you?

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.030
I could search for,

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.150
what I can do is I can search for you

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.190
and see what groups you're in.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.830
I could probably guess which one it is,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.590
but really I was probably just gonna email you

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.870
to ask you for the name.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.830
No, I was hoping that you had an out,

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.390
your former algorithm would be there.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.190
Because again, if I have this,

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.910
if I have this obtuse name

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.510
that doesn't necessarily align,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.030
then people are gonna, it'll be hard.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.310
Certainly they'll associate with me.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.430
My search foo is not bad.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.350
I would probably try IRR,

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.670
see if that shows up.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.470
I don't remember what it stands for, infrared something.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.030
When that didn't work,

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.110
I would probably just search for you

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.190
and see what groups you're in.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.470
Okay, good.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.070
Yeah, the company is a-

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.830
A sufficient measure or a method exists

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.790
for which people can find out what they don't know.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.630
Yes, yeah.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.470
It's funny.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.630
I'm sure a lot of companies are the same way,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.950
but well Yammer is, it's funny.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:53.270
Our company is in love with email.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.550
Yes.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.950
It's hard for them to get out.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.270
So we have Yammer, they're part of Microsoft now,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.750
and we're using Yammer internally.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.710
And some people are into it,

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.950
but for a lot of people just haven't,

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.430
it's just not there yet.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.910
I hate email and I worked on the email team.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:09.750
I'm trying.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.750
And now that we're part of this larger organization,

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.630
the operating systems group, even more so.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.990
And it's not that phone calls can be intrusive.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.230
It sounds like you need to walk to my office every time,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.390
but I don't think people realize how much

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.510
what a black hole discussion lists are

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.830
for sharing information, email discussion lists.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.670
Yeah.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.630
You don't have threaded,

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.870
well you have threaded conversation, but it's lost.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.190
If I join, if this was a distribution list,

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.510
I could put all your emails into a folder

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.070
and search from that folder, it'd be great.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.030
But if I join it late, I can't find any of that stuff.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.340
I can't make those connections.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.340
And if there's a reply to one, that gets lost too.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.780
There's a degree of persistence missing.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.180
Yeah, I was talking to someone who's working

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.620
with the Yammer team on something

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.900
and they were frustrated because

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.820
they will not respond to email.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.820
If I want to get a response,

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.620
I have to send something to them on Yammer.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.460
Great.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.300
And they were frustrated.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.740
I thought, well, doesn't that make sense?

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.580
Come on.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.530
So that's a hard,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.130
I don't know what it is.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.690
Maybe it's because I have a thirst

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.850
for discovering what I don't know, I don't know.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.170
Where I want to, I would prefer to use Yammer

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:28.170
or some sort of archivable, social,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.610
discoverable, open, public, transparent group

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.490
for discussing and figuring out my problems than email.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.810
In fact, I just solved this huge problem this week

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.770
in some work I'm doing and it's all an email.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.170
There's no way, you know,

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.210
we document it for our team in our OneNote,

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.570
but when some other team, and I guarantee you,

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.730
some other team will run into the same problems

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.730
I had to solve this week,

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.080
they have no way of discovering the solution.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.960
Yeah, well, they do have a way,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.560
but it's gonna rely a lot on magic and hope.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.280
Right?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.800
If for some reason someone has the idea

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.960
that connects that person's network to yours somehow,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.800
then there's a chance they could do it.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.640
Yeah, we have an archive.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.760
My problem with email right now

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.520
is the signal to noise ratio is just awful.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.520
It is, and email is a very good medium

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.080
for sharing announcements, it's information sharing.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.440
It's not a great, email is not a great,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.840
for a corporation, not a great discussion mechanism.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.320
It is information sharing, not knowledge sharing.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.040
I like that.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.720
So we got a new boss,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.640
and one of the things that I think is fantastic

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.200
about this guy, he has done now three different slide decks,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.480
and one of the things he talks about is-

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.480
Wait, the other thing we do too much besides email

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.920
is PowerPoint, but go on.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.720
No, no, PowerPoint is fine.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.560
No, no.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.600
What we need is more,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.640
we need more communication and less babbling.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.240
I'll let you, now I will rant on PowerPoint

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.720
for one second and go back to your manager.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.640
So we are so addicted to it that I review,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.480
I'm one of the reviewers for Think Week papers every year.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.720
Which are internal papers,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.440
people trying to write about their great ideas.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.320
Every year there's at least one or two yahoos

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.080
who submit their Think Week paper

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.360
as a PowerPoint slide deck.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.200
Sweet.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.900
Guess what rating they get from me.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.980
It's the same number of fingers I hold up to Brent

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.200
when I'm mad at him.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200
All right, onto your boss.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.420
Yeah, I know how I'm gonna post my next one then.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.570
All right, anyway, one of the things

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.930
that's really cool about him

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.210
is now in three different slide decks,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.050
he talks about Google Alerts.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.930
And I think it's cool

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.570
because he talks about our competitor

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.130
and what they're doing awesome.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.810
And he subscribes to Google Alerts.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.150
And what Google Alerts does

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:58.470
is it gives him a sort of an intelligent agent

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.170
sitting back behind the scenes

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.130
and he's able to customize and say,

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:08.220
hey, these are the sorts of things I care about.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.620
Let me know when something that I care about

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.180
pops up and make everything else go away.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.970
And I would love to be able to do that with email.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.370
Tell me what I care about or should care about

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.380
and make everything else go someplace else.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.740
I used to have a rule, in fact, I still have a rule.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.980
A rule suck.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.940
Well, I have a rule where only mail

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.900
or I'm on the tour CC line comes to my inbox.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.900
But even with that, these days,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.980
single to noise ratio is awful.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.520
Well, yeah, because people will start off sending,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.040
well, Alan needs to know about the noise level

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.840
or this monitor thingy

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.400
or the fact that his test case suite is...

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.360
Not so much.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.200
None of this.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.360
Somebody else decided that you need to know this.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.720
And then they very quickly realized

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.840
that you're ignoring the announcement to the DL.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:03.310
And so start putting the DL plus Alan Page next to it.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.430
Right?

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.270
I hate that.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.050
It's no, Alan needs this information.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:14.140
And I will work through his wall of whatever.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.840
Anyway, manager slide deck.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.020
What's going on with your new boss?

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.900
No, the whole point was talking about Google alerts.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.300
My new boss is completely awesome.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.260
I am just...

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.980
He must listen to the podcast.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.820
I don't think so.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.660
Not yet.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.500
Not yet.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.910
Yeah.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:37.980
I am just a tad shy of just blatant hero worship.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.940
This guy's awesome.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.940
All right, yeah, we'll talk about him more later.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.220
Give me names and stuff.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.680
All right.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.560
I read a blog post this week.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.840
It was said there's no such thing as agile testing,

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.800
which yeah, makes, I mean, there's, to me,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.160
it's all just testing.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.120
The post was talking about sort of what does the tester do

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.960
on the agile team?

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.360
And I want to talk about the post

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.000
because I thought the premise of the post was good.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.300
I didn't, I thought the arguments the author made

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.000
were totally off the wall.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.120
What primary argument?

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.960
It was a lot of hearsay.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.080
But it made me think in relationship to we're talking

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.800
about with more and more teams moving

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.400
to being engineering teams, you know,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.800
whether they're agile or not.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.800
And agile is this label that means now means 850,000

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.640
different things.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.240
So on an engineering team of generalizing specialists

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.440
or specializing generalists or specializing specialists,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.840
maybe not the third one.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.780
Well, it's going to start up.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.460
So generally when I see agile testing,

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.640
it's when I've seen that deployed,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.560
it's basically a group of specialists trying

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.400
to work together.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.240
All right.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.360
So let's reiterate one thing we've talked about before

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.310
is that if you try and make an engineering team,

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.630
you know, a team of, you know what I mean,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:59.470
engineering team.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.710
So it's titleless people.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.370
If you expect everyone to do everything soup to nuts,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.210
you're screwed.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.490
You're totally screwed.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.490
So that doesn't work that way.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.770
You're going to have specialists.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.330
So what is the role or what are some examples,

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.250
nothing about mine as well,

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.930
but I want to hear your answer first.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.930
What are some examples of the test specialist role

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.290
on an engineering team?

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.010
So first and foremost,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.820
I am very much against that idea in the first place.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.800
Against having a test specialist?

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.980
Uh, yeah.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.820
Talk about that.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.260
And I'll argue with you.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.280
I think I've talked about before that when I first went

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.430
into development, that I had a mix of folks.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:03.630
Some came from more of a dev centric specialization

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.820
and some came more from a test centric specialization.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.120
And when I started off, I'm like,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.200
I will have none of that.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.600
Everyone's going to work together and solve

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.040
the same problems.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.040
And I viewed coding and testing as skill sets, not roles.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:29.870
The team we talked about before where the team really

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.160
started to click with that.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.160
And as they started getting better and better,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.680
what we found is when I first put down and say,

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.440
everyone tests their own stuff.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.400
What I found just in summation is that the code got better,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.600
became a lot more modular.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.520
We found less bugs slipping through the cracks.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.520
And it became more modular because writing complex code

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.400
is a pain in the ass to test.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.600
And once I said, go ahead, write complex code,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.080
but you're testing it.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.040
And then when I started harassing them about why

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.680
the hell is this thing that we estimated for two days

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.920
is taking three weeks, right?

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.480
It basically ended up forcing them to modularize

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.000
and make it easier to test and easier to validate.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.660
But that same process of modularization ended up

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.980
making it easier for us to add new features

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.300
to the product.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.020
I'm all on board there.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.900
Well, so the punchline is once the team clicked

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.940
and was really going through high throughput,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.490
I then started asking myself, at what point in time

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:45.590
would I hire a tester to augment this team?

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:49.410
And quite honestly, I really struggled with that.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.810
I still don't have an answer that I'm very happy with.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.130
So let me answer it.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:54.970
So I'm all on the board.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.290
I think there is no, on an engineering team,

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.690
there is no role for a functional test specialist.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.050
So I think, absolutely.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:06.360
I think the huge benefit of someone writing tests

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.240
for their own code is they end up writing better code

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.160
because they realize, oh shit, my code can't be tested.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.480
So that's great.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.320
But what I would hire a tester for is I need someone,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.160
how do I evaluate this thing end to end?

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.840
Maybe through instrumentation, maybe through analysis,

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.000
maybe a data job.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.360
Who's the person to figure out,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.800
how am I gonna make sure we do adequate load testing on this?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.440
Or looking at some of the, we call the NFRs,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.880
the non-functional things.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.640
Those are things where I see

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.280
where a test specialist fits in there.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.760
Because I think the people from the old test role

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.800
who are good, are good systems thinkers,

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.680
they can look at the thing and figure out

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.320
where the holes are.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.200
They're also process improvers.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.640
And again, this is weird, because it's not really,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.400
I'll talk about what I'm doing right now,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.050
which is not at all testing, but it's valuable.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:56.890
I'll get to it in a moment.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.450
But I think what the test role is,

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.730
is not really a test role.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.010
It's a engineering productivity,

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.490
and maybe a quality role.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.690
There's some gaps that the person who's,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.690
I'm developing the code, I'm running my test for it.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.170
They may not be as good at thinking about,

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.690
now how does this fit into the whole system,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.410
not architecturally, but how,

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.410
what does the threat model or security look like?

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:21.930
Maybe I have some expertise there.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.450
There's a bunch of little gaps

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.290
that I think need to be filled in,

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.930
that may not be able to be filled in

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.450
by the traditional software developer.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.890
So, couple of things there.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.410
First off, when I first went into dev,

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.210
my team was around six, seven people.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.070
And that sort of specialization,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.360
there's really not an ROI for bringing in,

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.160
on that team, that small.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.200
There's no economy of scale there.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.320
The second thing is,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.960
but we still had this integration problem.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.880
And what we ended up doing very dynamically,

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.120
we ended up creating sort of a monitoring site

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.760
that allowed anybody on the team,

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.160
whether or not they had written that component,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.480
to very quickly visualize

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.040
how the system was operating end to end.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.960
And we got actually very good at,

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.040
one person within 30 minutes could figure out,

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.220
hey, our customer value proposition,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.160
what we own end to end,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.080
is in the weeds and it's because of this right here.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.660
Yeah, I think on a larger team,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.400
you're gonna find more need

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.800
for some of those specializations.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.320
And for example, and I wanna.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320
So actually, and I agree,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.480
but your question was,

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.440
what's the role on an agile team?

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.280
No, no, that wasn't really.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.800
Not necessarily on an agile organization.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.160
That was the inspiration for it.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.520
I say, what's the role of a test specialist

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.560
on an engineering team?

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.800
So what I think actually,

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.640
I don't think they're test specialists.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.740
I think that is a team,

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.700
a specialized team of these same engineers

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.150
who are focused on solving that security problem

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.030
or that performance problem.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.690
They are, the one thing that they,

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.090
as a whole have in common,

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.110
is deep knowledge on this area of expertise.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.610
And what I have found to be the most valuable

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.110
is what they do is they figure out

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.510
how to automate that expertise so that the other teams.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.950
I think a lot of people worry that,

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.670
well, I don't know what to do on this team.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.670
I have these areas of expertise.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.030
I think there are,

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.550
I don't think we need nearly as many test specialists

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.990
as we have today, these large test teams.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.550
But I think some of the attributes,

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.430
I'll give you my example in a second.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.090
Some of the attributes of things

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.750
that make people good testers are very valuable

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.700
as a, almost a generalization to the team.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.570
My superpower, if I were to probably have any of my last,

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.770
several managers describe it,

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.130
is I just can figure out how stuff works.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.210
I can figure things out,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.410
even if they're kind of outside of my wheelhouse.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.910
So because I'm leaving on sabbatical,

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.130
coming up here a while, I wanted to take on,

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.890
but I wanted to have some work to do

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.890
that would have an end date that would,

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.730
but wouldn't be critical path.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.330
So I've been working on a lot of work

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:22.360
getting our Git repositories moved to Visual Studio Online

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.580
and getting builds working

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.780
and on-prem build controllers

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.640
and learning all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.300
And the biggest one finally solved this morning

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.700
was the coordination of active directory credentials

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.340
with online credentials.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.740
So anyway, some interesting things

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.820
and everything's working great now.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.660
So we're gonna be ready to migrate before I go.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.820
So I'm pretty happy.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.940
But is that testing not even close?

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.340
But is it, did I learn a bunch of new stuff

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.380
and that I provide value to the team?

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.220
Sure, and that's my role.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.380
So it's definitely not a test specialist role.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.580
That's a very generalist role.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.180
I was able to expand my field of knowledge

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.160
and learn some new things.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.100
I think there are roles for people who...

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.160
I don't, so I actually gave a brief speech

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.480
to my team recently,

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.200
and I thought I talked about it on the podcast,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.800
but because I can't remember,

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.520
I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead and do it again.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:25.960
The testers, I don't think testing is what's valuable

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.960
in the way we've been doing it.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.160
Like even from my own experience, as I just discussed,

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.160
there's better ways of doing it to deliver quality.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.560
However, one of the things people are freaking out about

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.240
is, hey, does that mean I'm no longer valued?

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.200
And I've said, no, no, no, no.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.240
Testers, they have four key things

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.520
that they are attributes.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.040
I'm uncomfortable calling it a role,

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.060
but I'll say attributes that testers seem to have in common

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.000
from my experience.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.560
Number one, they are very good

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.360
at considering code quality issues.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.860
We're good at looking at code

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.400
and going, you screwed up right there.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.280
I remember like yesterday, about 10 years ago,

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.080
the dev architect did an off by one bug in his if loop.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.280
And oh, I mocked him forever.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.080
What the hell's an if loop?

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.440
I'm sorry, if statement.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.000
All right.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.880
Would be a, yeah, whatever, moving on.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.140
Code quality, we're good at that.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.720
Finding bugs is how we think of it,

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.820
but that's not the value.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.880
It's about getting code quality up.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.580
Customer quality, we're good at that.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.000
Considering how the customer thinks

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.560
and what sort of things would make them happy,

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.200
that's something we're good at.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.300
Coding, we know how to code.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.160
We're not gonna, I mean, the best of us

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.660
isn't going to be better than the best of,

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.660
say, the current development,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.560
but there is a great deal of things

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.420
that we as a function, as a group,

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.780
are quite good at doing.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.980
Large number of us could write a high-performing web UI

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.140
without batting an eye.

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.660
And then lastly, we're very good at systems thinking.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.420
We're very good at thinking things through end to end.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.820
And none of those four things,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.460
no matter what our role is,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:27.030
none of those, the value of those four things diminish

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.330
in any way, shape, or form.

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.600
Those will always be valuable.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.320
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.240
I think what goes away is the,

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.640
give me your code, I'll play with it for a while.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.600
I'll tell you where the bugs are.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.560
I give it to you, you give it back to me.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.080
That stuff's gone.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.240
Good riddance.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.080
Good riddance.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.960
All right, we got about five minutes left.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.090
We better get to the mailbag.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.780
All right, Brent, you have the first question

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.620
from the mailbag.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.460
Yep, so I had a 101 with a guy I hadn't talked to

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.100
in a couple of years.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.940
Found out, by the way, that in some regards,

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.820
our podcast is going viral.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.420
Meaning he found the link and forwarded on

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.540
to several people.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.500
Yeah, I don't think that counts.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.860
Viral's viral, baby.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.220
In our next podcast, I will teach Brent definitions.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.400
Yeah, I look forward to that conversation.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.780
I'm all about virality.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.980
Anyway, what I'm saying is that we've clearly

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.620
have moved away from, hey, just people just listening

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.460
for themselves that are now at a point

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.060
where they're sharing with others.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.520
Good, what was the question?

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.400
As we were talking through it, he asked,

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.960
hey, Brent, this is all great, episode seven.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.440
However, one question I had is,

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.730
I'll leave it to you to answer this.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.930
How will it work when we're in this world

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.870
where managers have 10 to 30 direct reports?

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.410
How the hell are they gonna scale?

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.330
How will my manager know what I need to do

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.950
at review time?

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.970
That was sort of the, how will he be able

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.210
to prop me up correctly at review time?

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.140
And how will he grow my career?

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:19.980
God, people are-

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.580
He says, asking the guy who's not a manager.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.780
People, well, I will tell you that I think 30

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.020
gets a little bit hard.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.780
I think if 10 to 20 freaks you out,

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.300
you're probably not cut out to be an engineering lead

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.660
in the new world.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.100
I think when I talk to people about this,

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.260
I recommend The One Minute Manager,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.660
which is, if you ever read the book,

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.060
it is about manager is overwhelmed

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.460
with how much stuff he has to do,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.620
and the stuff's not getting done,

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.660
talks to the guru,

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.060
tells him how to be the one minute manager,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.100
which basically means that instead of spending

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.980
all your time monitoring your employees,

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.300
you dive in and out.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.620
You give them guidance when needed,

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.380
praise when needed, you get in and out,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.180
and let them, and guess what happens

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.960
when you get in and out and get out of their way

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.680
and give them what they need to do?

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.940
They grow on their own.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.780
Yes.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.140
They figure stuff out.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.580
One of the reasons your team doesn't grow

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.500
is when you spend all your time trying

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.960
to micromanage them.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.380
It's effort on you,

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.580
and it hinders your employees' career.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.220
What should the micromanager do differently?

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.060
They need to learn how to step.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.980
They need to give your team a framework

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.880
they can work in and be successful,

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.900
give them the right coaching they need

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.460
to continue to achieve that success,

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.540
and then get the hell out of their way.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.820
So, Alan, actually, there's a reason

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.700
why I wanted you to ask or answer this.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.540
Yes.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.340
Alan has stated over and over again,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.420
he's super allergic to being a manager.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.860
No, I'm super allergic to being a manager at Microsoft.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:54.320
Okay, now, let's say you're a current team,

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.440
but you have no management chain now.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.650
Is your team gonna go into the weeds,

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.140
and are you guys all gonna get bad reviews?

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.620
On my team, no.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.540
Why?

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.540
Because we have a value of being super transparent

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.340
and a value of collaboration,

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.540
everybody on the team knows to do that.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.560
Everybody knows what everybody else is doing.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.960
Say that we got rid of all our managers,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.220
and we all just reported directly to my boss.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.700
I think we would probably rely even more

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.620
on peer feedback for, along those things

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.460
we talked about earlier, on collaboration, et cetera,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.680
for how we're evaluated.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.100
But also what's gonna happen is

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.660
you're going to have leaders pop up

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.020
out of that team of 30 people.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.420
You're gonna have people who rise as technical leaders,

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.740
who rise in and out, World of Warcraft,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.340
project management style I talked about last time.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.860
Leaders pop in and out, groups form.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.620
As a manager, you see those in your brief

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.140
coaching and monitoring sessions,

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.420
so you know what's going on.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.220
And if you're not transparent,

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.580
and you don't value collaboration,

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.080
and you don't share with each other,

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.780
it is gonna be very difficult to tell

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.520
who I need to give big rewards to versus smaller rewards.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.140
But I think, Chris, my manager,

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.500
mentioned having the whole team report to him,

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.940
which is about 35 people right now.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.420
I think he's still gonna go to his senior people,

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.620
his technical leaders, even though they're not managers,

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.660
and ask them about people on the team

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.740
to get more information.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.740
But if you have 30 people,

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.620
won't everybody go in random directions?

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.980
No, if you have 30 people and no leadership on the team,

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.940
but you have your engineering manager

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.180
who's in charge of managing the team,

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.820
coaching, make sure everybody has what they need,

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.380
people are going to do peer mentoring and peer coaching,

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.590
and you're gonna have leaders on that team.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.070
We should move on to the next.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.910
Well, no, because actually I wanna bring something up,

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.750
and we're gonna have to do the other question next time.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.830
So one thing I'll just say on this is,

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:48.990
my answer to this,

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.070
and you just talked about it a great deal,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.550
but we talked about the IRR earlier, and the reason why.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.810
My answer to this, in this world,

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.550
reducing the friction around knowledge sharing

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.190
is absolutely the key to making this succeed.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.950
Yeah, I think it's a huge part of it.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.790
So I wanna bring up,

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.230
I was thinking about this topic since our last podcast,

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.990
and I remember Brent and I have been having lunch together,

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:16.710
meeting together for like five years,

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.110
and I remember one of our-

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.110
Feels like 10.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.090
One of our first meetings,

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.990
we're over at a place called Saigon City,

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.390
having some Vietnamese-

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:25.350
They're closed now.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.190
No way!

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.030
Yeah, out of business.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:31.560
Oh no, oh god, I love that place.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.400
In a moment?

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.440
All right, back in business here, wow.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.000
It's a good thing we have a new favorite place.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.800
Where am I gonna get a 21?

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.640
Oh man, the 21 was so good.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.960
Black check table, please.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.120
The number 21 on the menu.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.480
So we're having lunch there,

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.600
and Brent's talking about, we're talking about Google,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.040
and Brent says to me,

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.680
this is just a few short years ago,

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.680
Brent says to me, I could never work at Google.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.800
I said, why not, Brent?

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.660
He goes, they expect managers to manage up to 15 people,

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.380
and there is no way I would manage on a team like that,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.820
because I couldn't give my employees

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.100
the amount of career growth and coaching

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.780
they needed to be successful.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.390
Yep, and ever since,

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.390
so I remember that conversation.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.030
I'm glad you did.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.710
No, I've used that over and over again.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.150
But one of the things that I do do

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.190
is I spend a lot of time thinking through,

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.870
why the hell do they think they can?

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.590
What did they figure it out?

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.230
I've now learned that.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.270
Yeah, and that's actually a good mode for anything.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:36.910
When you see something you disagree with,

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.070
somebody says something,

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.470
what's their motivation behind that?

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.390
Why are they thinking that way,

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:41.750
and see if there's some value there for you?

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.500
And how do they do it?

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.140
How do they make it scale?

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.460
Yeah, that was, so back then in those days,

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.500
and it was longer than five years ago,

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.360
I had a rule of thumb,

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.040
and it's something that I even taught my leads

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.040
who reported to me, is that my expectation is

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.320
that you're spending around 10% of your time

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.960
with each of your employees.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.800
So if you have 10, that's all you're doing.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.160
Well, over there, it was common to have

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.280
20 to 40 direct reports.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.390
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.630
I don't see how my current tool set

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.590
will enable me to scale that.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:22.700
And people management is critical to me.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.660
If I can't even consider a position

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.020
where I would fail on that.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.580
Yeah, I would love to talk more about this,

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.740
but we're losing our room,

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.780
and I'm late for a meeting.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.180
So thanks, everyone.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.140
We're gonna get to the other mailbag question

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.980
next time, and I'm Alan.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:37.820
I'm Brent.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.660
And we'll see you later.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.480
Bye.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.320
Bye.
