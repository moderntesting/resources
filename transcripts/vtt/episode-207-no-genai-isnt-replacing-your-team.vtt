00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.630
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.950
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.430
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.940
Now on with the show.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.260
I have pressed record.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.360
I have pressed the intro.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.300
I have not yet pressed Brent.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.650
Brent, how are you doing today?

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.810
I'm doing super.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.020
Super like super man, super dog.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.460
I am emotionally positive.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.900
I am physically drained, as you know.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.930
So we got delayed a week for the podcast.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.930
So I know what is it?

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.690
Jason gets ticked off when we're late.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.840
Well, you get what you pay for, right?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.080
Although even if he had paid for it, we would have still been late.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.760
I was last week suffering through my second bout of the COVID.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.160
I officially was negative yesterday.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.800
So a little longer than 10 days.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
How was it this time?

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.480
I know- Oh, this one sucked.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.120
Oh, really?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.360
Because I know somebody who just got it for the first time.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.560
And it was kind of mellow for them.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.560
I hate them.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.120
But I'm still one and done.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.840
It's inevitable.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.920
It's inevitable that I'll get it sometime and I don't walk to you.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
But the darn thing's never going away.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.840
And it's just going to become the new 10 day flu.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.000
It's horrible.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.620
For me, no.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.100
So both times, it was the first day that sucked.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.300
But last time, I just felt tired and miserable.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.860
This time, like, no, nausea, full on fever, pain out

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.420
of every nerve in my body, it sucked.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.410
But it only sucked for about 36 hours.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.730
Not bad.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.490
So the rest of it was, I mean, I just worked from home.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.570
The first day, I'm like, yeah, I'm not working.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.450
But after that, worked from home.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.010
My daughter also got COVID.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.370
I'm pretty certain that's who I got it from.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.690
She was showing- Did you kick her out of the house?

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.410
No.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.410
No.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.890
But we both sort of hung out in our own room.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.890
We had just flown back from Florida.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.520
I just came back from a- That's where you got it.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.680
Pretty certain, actually.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.200
Yeah.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.890
And my son sat in between us on the whole plane trip.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.330
And he managed to not get it at all.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.370
So what's up with that?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.170
I don't know.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.050
I don't know.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.730
It's a weird thing.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.930
Maybe your son's a robot.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.690
Who knows?

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.370
Who knows?

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.170
He might be.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.650
All right.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.370
I don't know if I- I just got back from LA.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.970
Went down there for a couple of days, hung out with the team.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.250
It's weird to have a meeting in a meeting room.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.410
One, it's massively productive.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.090
But two, I couldn't figure out how to make the-

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.650
I mean, eventually, I did figure it out.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.690
But I was intimidated by the room control

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.610
to plug in my laptop or we all joined the meeting together.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.330
That's something I haven't dealt with in many years.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.860
That was a little while ago.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.900
I don't know if I did that.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.700
Anyway, fun stuff.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.740
It's weird.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.260
Good times.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.620
It's weird.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:14.150
There is one in-person meeting that I have on my calendar.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.390
And I regularly attend it.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.150
It's weird pre-COVID versus post-COVID.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.030
It's sort of a status-recording meeting.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.670
The things before COVID, I would avoid the plague.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.910
I regularly attend this one, and I look forward to it

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.080
because it's like novel to do an in-person meeting, even now,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.960
today.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.640
Yeah.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.640
Yeah.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.400
It's weird.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.360
It's weird.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.880
I don't know.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.240
But it was- it's great.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.440
It's such an accelerant to get folks together.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.120
It was beneficial in so many hundreds of ways.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.280
But it's different and weird.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.160
Long days, too.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.400
I ended up meeting with the team all day and then dinner at night

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.280
with a lot of 14-hour days of sort of on, which is for us INTPs

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.580
or us eyes, especially, it's pretty exhausting.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:18.920
I think we've begun to forget the degree to which

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.940
in-person collaboration is an accelerant.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.210
Absolutely.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.550
We talk about Async all the time.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.330
But I'll tell you, number one, in comparison to you,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.530
particularly the way you told the story at Unity,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.640
my team has not figured out Async even remotely close

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.160
to how you described it at UN.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.160
We were pretty good there.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.520
And we were before.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.560
The difference is if you're in 10 time zones,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.640
literally, I mean more actually, but 10

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.080
that I'm working with very closely,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.840
you have to figure it out.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.080
And the thing I've been thinking a lot more

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.000
about this remote work, and it's not all Async.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.280
You have to figure how to work both synchronously

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.000
and asynchronously.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.960
And it's hard with you and I because we're

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.520
working remote at a company that isn't fully remote.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.640
Like fully remote companies have because they're not

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.760
paying any rent, have all kinds of budget for travel

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.440
and getting these teams together.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.280
And of course, Microsoft, everybody

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.480
gets a million dollars for travel for their budget.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.520
So it's a little different.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.600
No.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.200
Not the last several years, no.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.480
Yeah, but I'm being facetious.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.480
Even at Microsoft, it's hard to mean for,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.080
I get where Satya's coming from.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.040
I'm already paying for how many buildings on campus

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.880
that are 25% full.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.600
I can't up the travel budget just because people who are remote

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.000
aren't getting together.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.680
And I know a lot of folks at Microsoft are in the area,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.680
but I know they don't go to the office, they could.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.560
But you've been hiring more remotely as well

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.920
because it's a better way to hire good people.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.280
So it's weird and it's good to get people together.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.880
And I think it's necessary.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.960
And I think we're still, I mean,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.960
work changed in the last couple of years.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.560
And we haven't quite adapted to the involvement yet.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.060
And we're gonna have to figure that shit out.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.420
I completely agree.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.540
All right.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.620
Okay, let's get into,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.620
dun dun dun, little transition thing past the,

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.960
is there are people, do you hear that?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.800
No.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.880
Good, I'm gonna turn off that app.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.820
I have an app, it's giving me some notifications.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.900
If that was in the thing, I'd be all kinds of,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.420
ah, stop it.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.260
Okay, we got a couple ideas for a topic.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.340
Do you wanna start with number one or number two?

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.970
Uh, there is a third that I just saw.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.530
A what?

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.730
Yeah.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.370
Like is like breaking news somewhere?

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.180
Oh my God, is it crouch track again?

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.940
No, here, I will.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.330
Breaking news on the A.B. testing podcast.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.370
Do I have a breaking news sound effect?

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.490
I need more sound effects in my thing.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.620
How many, have you populated them off?

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.620
No, I can upload as many as I want.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.140
I just haven't bothered because I didn't know

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.070
we're gonna have like things, you have to warn me.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.030
You have to warn me, Brent.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.050
I don't.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.070
Okay, Brent has shared with me.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.910
Oh.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.830
You know what, I forgot about this one.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.430
Do you wanna talk about that one?

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.990
We can talk about that one.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.110
This is live, live here on the A.B. testing podcast.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.750
So does that count as a mailbag?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.500
Or is it just a question?

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.340
It feels like a mailbag.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.880
I don't know if I need to press the button or not, Brent.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.720
Yeah, go ahead.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.480
I mean, it's in general, but go ahead.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.680
Let's call the mailbag.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.800
All right, we have a mailbag.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.400
I think just because the amount of joy

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.200
you push in that button brings me,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.160
I think if it's ambiguous, it's a mailbag.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.000
I want to press more buttons.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.160
And it's my fault for not having more.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.400
I should be adding all kinds of quirky little sound effects

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.440
because that's what's gonna get us

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.840
downloads and clicks.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.760
That's how we get from three to four listeners, right?

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.260
So I did read this article a few days ago

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.100
and the article someone sent to us

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.660
and who sent it to us?

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.060
It was not Brent.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.380
Brent, that's not you.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.420
It was sent by, sorry, someone on our,

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.740
oh, from our, what do you call it?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.940
Our Slacker group, one of the three.slack.com.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.280
Walmart, is that the full name we have here?

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.560
Walmart, that's the name we know now.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.280
Nice looking guy.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.200
Sent us a blog post from Stack Overflow

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.280
and would love to hear our opinion.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.320
And the title is called,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.080
Generative AI is Not Going to Build

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.880
Your Engineering Team for You.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.000
Subtitle, it's easy to generate code,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.320
but not so easy to generate good code.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.000
Do we just say correct and move on

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.010
or do you want to talk about more?

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.410
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.610
I want to talk about more.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.540
All right, then we'll continue.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.610
Yeah, there is, like I do hear rumblings.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.490
Like it's interesting.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.130
Like number one, I'm gonna share my intern

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.730
that I had this last summer, okay?

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.990
He, it was not a CS degree.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.390
He, we hired him, he was a cybersecurity.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.060
He was going for a cybersecurity doctorate.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:55.260
And one day I asked him to,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.540
hey, I need you to do this and do this

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.380
and do this analysis, okay?

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.800
He did all of that the next day.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.850
But then showed me a working,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.450
highly interactive website

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.530
that he had just put together

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:19.530
that also allowed you to drill into the analysis.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.890
And I will tell you, no one on my,

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.730
like I run a data science team

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.770
that has a lot of development talent,

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.490
but no one on my team is skilled at UI.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.690
And he showed me something that was like,

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.340
holy crap, I'm like, how did you do that?

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.900
And he's like, oh, yeah, I don't know how to build UI either.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.460
I just had chat GPT write it for me.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.500
And I'm like, oh, whoa.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.360
So I had, he's unfortunately gone.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.000
I wanted him to sit down and show me.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.320
And did his code break the day after he left?

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.260
No, no, that thing's still running.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.350
And I'm like, okay.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.710
I'm like, all right,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.390
this thing is capable of doing things

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.320
that even I hadn't dreamed up yet.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.800
And I still kind of want it.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.640
I may call him just to check in and see how he's doing.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.000
Like he was a fantastic intern.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.760
All right, so what's interesting for me in this article,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.080
and it brings us back on topic here.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.440
I think you're a little bit on topic,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.200
but I'll put a link to it in the show notes

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.840
that if you read those,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.360
did I mention go to the one of the three.slack.com

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.800
or to go to moderntest.org to get a link there,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.960
you can sign up.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.840
So the subtitle to me is odd,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.600
it's not the key point of the article.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.800
They do discuss it.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.200
And we all know this, anybody who's dealt with co-pilot

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.360
or asking chat GPT to code,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.120
yeah, it can do code that solves problems.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.400
It can even fix the errors that it creates

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.360
and eventually you can come up with something that works.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.400
Is it good code?

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.360
No, you need to look at it

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.120
and you need to be able to read code.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.880
Again, going to back to my prediction

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.400
from eight months ago in the beginning of the year,

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.840
being a good code reader and reviewer

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.280
is going to grow as a valuable skill more than writing it

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.280
because chat GPT or I'll say Gen AI can get you started.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.560
So there's some talking on that,

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.820
but I wanna, I don't know if you read the whole article,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.940
but that is a good point.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.860
And I think it's been discussed quite a bit,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.700
but also the article ends up being a lot about

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.820
advocating for hiring junior engineers.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.240
Right.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.560
And like head nod, like whiplash head nod from me.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.440
And I think it's interesting to tie that

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.000
into the overall story, but to me that was,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.080
I'm curious in your takeaway,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.280
so I wanna dive into that, but first,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.680
did you see that too with the,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.760
for you was the article more about writing good code

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.280
or more about why hiring junior engineers

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.760
is helpful in growing them to some engineers, et cetera.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.200
I think the article was written

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.850
to try to put a statement around there

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.770
that does appear to be something companies are doing.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.100
The, like, okay.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.740
And that is cutting back on their payroll,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.500
not lowering the rate at which we hire

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.230
junior engineers because the quote unquote,

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:58.150
Gen AI can automate their jobs.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.990
Right.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.610
And I think they're basically saying no.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:09.130
And that kind of, so in some regards, like what,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.440
to me, it is, no, we should not stop hiring

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.120
junior engineers.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.800
Well, I mean, nobody advocated for that.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.800
I will tell you a lot of the people making decisions

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.270
to cut back on their payroll

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.430
because of the existence of Gen AI.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.150
I think you're taking a massive risk

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.990
because they're kind of putting their finger in the air

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.390
and going, oh, this is where we're going.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.740
So let's just go there now.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.380
Right. Yeah. Absolutely stupid.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.980
This is equivalent to teams that said,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.380
like when we talk about in modern testing,

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.540
like the tourniquet and Band-Aid story,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.140
but the companies that fired all their testers

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.380
because they saw some other company didn't have testers.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.380
They thought that would improve their quality

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.340
when there's a few missing pieces in there.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.020
Now, maybe it's similar.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.790
So what, I'm gonna draw a couple lines here together.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.480
Where do you get good senior engineers?

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.030
Joel Spolsky wrote an article about this 20 years ago.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.580
Can't you just now order them from amazon.com?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.420
I think.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.100
Because I think actually Amazon is one of the companies

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.500
that is cutting back on payroll.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.820
You have to go to the dark web for those,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.100
but Spolsky wrote an article

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.900
about where all the good senior engineers,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.820
something like this.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.820
And the point was that if you're a good senior staff engineer,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.340
you have a job that you like and you're well compensated.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.500
And if you decide you want to change jobs,

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.900
usually it's because you've been poached

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.300
and you have an offer and you're never on the market,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.820
or you're on the market for about a second.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.300
Like even in this economy,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.020
the good engineers, there's gonna be some exceptions,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.930
but generally they're not on the market for a long.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.450
We've been a little lucky, not lucky, unlucky,

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.290
depending on your point of view.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.530
There's been a few good months, Rob.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.450
But generally, they stay employed and gainfully employed.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.250
The best way to get senior engineers for me

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.970
is to hire the junior engineers when they're hungry

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.650
and get them to grow.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.210
But more importantly, more importantly,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.770
when I look at diversity,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.010
and not just diversity in race or sex,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.970
but diversity in ideas,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.730
diversity in different ways to solve a problem,

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.850
diversity in curiosity about how problems can be solved,

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.370
diversity in people thinking about what's possible

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.930
given their unique background,

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.690
that comes from my junior engineers.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.890
A lot of the senior folks,

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.730
they get used to solving problems a certain way

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.970
because they've been very good at it,

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.290
but they end up using their same toolbox a lot.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.410
They're very good at that toolbox.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.010
They deserve to be senior.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.730
But the reason I like to hire a lot of junior folks

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.650
is they bring new ideas and new ways of thinking.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.970
And if you replace them all with Gen AI,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.530
how many different ways does Gen AI have

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.690
to think about solving problems?

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.500
Exactly zero.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.060
Well, it has the LLM that was based on one idea.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.660
I'll give it one.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.060
Right, well, and it's because you said the word think.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.340
Oh, okay, you're correct.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.260
So I think you lose a lot of that.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.300
You lose the creativity in problem solving.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.820
Article also points out that writing code is the easy part.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.220
In software development it is.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.660
The people is really hard.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.300
Also, in thinking how the system works together really hard,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.620
there's all kinds of things that are super difficult

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.590
that aren't part of just spitting out

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.430
the method or the function.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.310
And that's the most here.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.380
Yeah, I...

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.500
I think writing code is easy.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.220
Writing code is easy.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.500
The thing...

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.400
The art that's dying if it's not already dead

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.560
that I still actively use,

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.240
and because I actively use it,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.920
I basically out produce any of my staff.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.360
And now that said, most of my staff,

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.080
only a couple of them have ever been in development.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.310
But that's design patterns.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:42.570
And, you know, the art of refactoring your code

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.240
such that there is just one line of code

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.440
that does the thing you need it to do

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.340
versus sort of copy paste, right?

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:01.490
I don't know that co-pilot can really do the design side of it.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.390
I'm looking at research right now.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.230
I was...

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.630
I just quickly looked because I...

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.150
There's a lot of things out there like researchers saying

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.550
and forecasters saying,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.430
oh yeah, it has the potential to reduce,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.990
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.870
I'm like, great, I don't care about your opinion.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.310
Has anyone done a study?

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.430
Like has anyone attempted to quantify it?

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.480
And I do find one, which I'm like, hmm.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.320
So I'll just read this.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.160
A field experiment involved would be nearly 2,000

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.500
developers at Microsoft and Accenture.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.320
For those who don't know,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.550
Accenture is one of the largest companies

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.390
that will do coding for hire.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.830
Coding mercenaries.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.670
Yeah, sure.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.470
Show the developers using co-pilot

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.470
completed 13 to 22% more poll requests per week

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.360
at Microsoft and seven and a half to eight

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.080
and a half percent at Accenture.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.480
Now, how do we feel about that frigging vanity metric?

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.520
I don't think it tells us anything by itself.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.710
No, more doesn't mean better, right?

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.720
But it's really hard to measure.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.000
Well, productivity is essentially the rate at which

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.960
you get more widgets out the door.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.160
So in some regards, okay, maybe poll requests

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.000
is the closest thing to productivity.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.060
I know for me, in some regards, it has sped me up.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.760
But in other regards, it has encouraged intellectual laziness.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.060
I have used that term extensively this week.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.840
So that's odd that you bring it up.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.980
Yeah, intellectual laziness, big bang for me.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.060
Oh, it absolutely is for me as well,

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.500
there's like simple things like I'm in Python

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.340
all of the time.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.260
I use the pandas data frame all of the time.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.100
And now I have noticed just this week

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.240
because I come back from vacation on coding again.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.600
And I'm like, oh, I got to convert this data frame

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.800
to a dictionary.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.400
By now I should have this memorized, but I don't.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.880
So I went to get a pilot and wrote a comment,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.390
convert this to a dictionary.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:54.450
And I realized, oh, I am never going to memorize it again

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.290
because it gets that one right.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.450
And I have memorized that I don't have to memorize this.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.930
You know, how do I feel about this?

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.330
A story I've told for, actually I think it's good

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.450
and I'm a parallel hero story I've told

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.390
for over 20 years now.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.610
As I began to like people ask me like,

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.650
Alan, you're a composer, I just learned to write code.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.970
And I said, writing code's fricking easy.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.690
But there's a lot of parallels.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.450
There's some creativity.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.930
Creativity is the design pattern.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.890
It's how am I going to solve this problem?

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.690
Because that's what chat GPT can't figure out.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.570
There's something here or co-pilot, JED AI.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.050
They're all interchangeably sometimes.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.370
Okay, so there's some creativity involved.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.410
How do I got to figure it?

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.410
Same with melody, what voice I want,

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.610
what dynamics are on what's this kind of the story

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:42.450
I want to tell.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.650
There's a creativity part.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.570
There's an infinite number of ways to do that.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.530
And then once you get that figured out,

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.290
there's a whole bunch of rote work.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.650
There's voicings and chords and progressions

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.490
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:59.490
It's really rote work based on math and formulas.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.650
Sounds a lot like programming.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.970
So as a composer, why, I mean,

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.240
I'm sure these things already exist

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.160
and in the composition tools, as they say,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.960
if I figure out like the base I want to do,

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.520
I sketch in some chords,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.520
I give it a few instructions on voicings and depth

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.160
and timbres I want and kabing, all my rote work is done.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.600
It's the same as having you add that to addiction,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600
convert that to a dictionary.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.720
It's the same damn thing.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.960
And I think it's okay.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.960
And actually I'm looking at another study right now,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.400
which is right along with what you're saying.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.920
Quote, so this is another one of the things

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.790
so this is another study done by McKenzie

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.870
and it seems much better.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:51.750
Good, finish it up.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.230
Cause I'm kind of getting excited about something.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.070
So take it there.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.230
Quote, developers using generative AI best tools

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.990
were more than twice as likely to report

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.830
overall happiness fulfillment in a state of flow.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.670
Yes.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.910
They attributed this to the tools ability

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.150
to automate grunt work that kept them

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.310
from more satisfying tasks.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.270
And it puts information at their fingertips

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:19.710
faster than a search for a solution across online platforms.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.550
Right.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.820
And that for me in those two sentences, that's 100% true.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.660
Yeah.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.500
So let me tie this back.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.340
So before Dan Pink wrote drive,

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.060
he wrote this book called a whole new mind,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.540
which is how right brainers, creative people,

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.540
we're gonna take over knowledge work.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.780
And yeah, creative work is so much more,

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.300
for me at least, a right brainer,

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.020
it's so much more enjoyable for me.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.860
It gives me energy when I can create things.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.700
And then I'm distracted when I have to do it.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.340
Like I almost go to a different part of my brain

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.020
and shift when I go to do the rote work.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.260
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.220
And if I can basically automate the part

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.900
I subconsciously don't wanna do

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.660
and spend more time doing the fun part

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.980
that's a little harder, that stretches my brain

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.460
and makes me kind of think.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.140
God, I'm fricking happy.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.380
And you know, if I'm happy doing my job,

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.780
if I love my job, do I create great work

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.740
or do I create shitty work?

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.700
I create great work.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.540
Yeah.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.380
It's proven.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.860
There's studies on this.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.140
If I'm happy and engaged in my job, I do great work.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.220
Happy people are productive people.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.060
Right.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.660
And I remember years ago,

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.780
I had a had an argument with my executive

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.660
because he had it backwards.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.540
Why does so many dumb people get to be executive?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.820
Because they get shit done.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.660
I mean, he was like-

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.860
It should be how you get it done.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.300
It should be how you get it done.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.140
I agree.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.700
It should be what kind of person you are.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.060
And I go back to Maxwell's levels of leadership.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.130
You are a leader because people want to follow you.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.090
Yeah, et cetera.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:03.850
I'm just kind of mad.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.690
I'm gonna rewind.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:05.530
Go ahead and talk.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:09.410
He is, let's see, is he still there?

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:10.450
He's still at Microsoft.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.890
When are you gonna, like,

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.410
things are changing there.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.050
Things are getting better.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.010
Can you get rid of the cruft?

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.610
He's no longer an executive.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.980
He's only a partner.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.240
Well, keep on-

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.680
I mean, that's still-

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.350
Still arresting, investing.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.150
They didn't take his stock away.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.650
Still there.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.920
Yeah, but he's not making executive money.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.560
So this is actually really interesting.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.720
Now, based on what I just said though,

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.120
and I would do this as a composer also,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.720
I'm gonna imagine I have co-pilot for composing.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.760
And this thing may exist.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.920
I haven't played with these tools in a long time.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.800
But I've written my melody kind of thing,

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.280
and I've used the AI, the Gen AI

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.280
to help me do some of the rote work.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.800
I still need to review it.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.960
I still, like, I can't just go,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.880
oh, I'm gonna bring this down to the studio

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.400
and have the orchestra play it.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.640
No, I'll get, there's, I gotta listen to it

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.080
and tweak it and do some hand massaging

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.120
to make sure it's what I want,

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.040
that it fulfills my creative intent.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.420
And you have to do the same thing with code.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.260
Yes.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.420
So, it's, yeah, that, again, yes,

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.980
because I'm getting back to the article here

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.660
that says that it generates code but not good code.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.380
And what I'm saying is we do the creative part,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.140
it does the hard part, then we have to go,

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.600
again, I think that's creative

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.580
to take what's been generated for us

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.940
and to turn it into something we like.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.820
Now, and here's the thing,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.620
like when it's circled back to the idea of,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.180
we still need junior developers, right?

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.840
Even with the stats, like,

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.360
if we take the stats that I see, all right,

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.680
and from the two studies, I'll say,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.340
okay, it does seem to be a, let's say,

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.300
a minimum of a 10% productivity boost.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.340
Okay, well, I know for a fact that students

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.480
at many colleges right now

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.260
are learning coding alongside chat CPT.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.540
The coding programs are including-

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.940
And that's wonderful, I think they should.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.060
Yeah, they absolutely should.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.340
Like the next set of junior people,

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.180
now, hopefully, they don't just learn how to gen AI code,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.790
they are learning, again, human and machine

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.030
working together towards a common goal

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.710
and not encouraging intellectual laziness

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.630
in the way that we both would disapprove of.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.990
But, go ahead, Fish.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:56.590
But, so if that 10% is real, right?

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.590
Yeah, maybe you don't need the 10 heads

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.550
you wanted to hire, you only need nine.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.760
But you still need that nine

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.320
and this is under the assumption

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.160
that these guys are skilled at using this

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.680
as a tool to get their stuff done.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.840
And this is what I think we can teach.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.160
And going back to, I love universities have this,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.440
I wanna steal their curriculum

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.420
and give it to the engineers we have today.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.120
Because what's missing today

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.600
in how people are using CoPilot

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.840
and we give people CoPilot to use

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.520
is they, we need like an exercise,

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.840
like a couple exercises,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.400
a set of exercises they go through

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.620
where they have to find practice,

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.460
finding the shortcomings of what it delivers

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.740
and how to iterate on that

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.060
and turn it into something that's efficient and effective.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.180
I think, like I have,

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.700
well, the stats are published overall,

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.420
they're similar to what I've looked at at our company.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.780
There's a percentage of,

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.300
of suggestions that are accepted

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.940
that's pretty consistent industry-wide.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.720
But there's a lot to learn there.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.440
But I just,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.540
I think even the engineers employed today

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.420
need to do that.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.060
I do love that college students are using,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.860
there are like professors are acknowledging,

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.500
and I hope they're doing this in other courses as well,

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.060
is using Gen AI as a tool.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.540
It's not a cheating tool.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.660
It should be an accelerant for work, for creative work.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.580
So I don't know, I'm kind of excited.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.580
I'm curious to see what it does

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.860
to the industry down the road,

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.860
but all these stupid stories about people thinking Gen AI

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.700
is going to flat out replace a bunch of engineers is dumb.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.340
It's gonna make some engineers more effective

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.900
so you need a few fewer.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.740
And as we've said before, for over a year now,

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.340
Gen AI is not going to take away jobs.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.120
No, Gen AI won't.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.440
It's people who don't,

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.430
well, people who understand how to leverage Gen AI may.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.390
Because yeah, a team of nine people

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.270
that know how to use Gen AI effectively

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.750
could probably effectively do the work

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.640
that 10 people could do two years ago.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.120
Or today.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.960
Sure.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.240
I was going back before chat GPT came out,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.080
but yeah, whatever.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.920
Oh, fair.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.780
Yeah, and it's interesting,

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.280
like I had a conversation on this exact scenario

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.040
just today with a brand new mentee.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.330
And it was interesting,

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:36.330
his approach to using Azure Co-Pilot was different than mine.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.090
And I'm like, oh, that's fascinating.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.210
Tell me more about it.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:48.460
He, like for me, I will do the whole comment thing.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.180
I assume you know what I'm talking about,

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.540
where you type in a comment and then it writes out the code.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.860
He likes using the side panel

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.500
and he'll instead ask it questions.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.340
Okay, good.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.300
One of the things that is one of my new favorite things

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.420
with Co-Pilot is if I had the exception in my code, right?

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.580
I can just say, oh,

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.540
depending on what I want it to do, right?

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.660
I'm a big believer and you don't use exceptions

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.740
for flow control.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:32.740
So I go, oh yeah, that's missing an assert.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.300
You know, please add that assert

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.940
and throw if that's missing.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.900
Or if it is an exception,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.940
like some of the calls will time out and I'm like, okay,

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.460
yeah, there's no way I can proactively guess

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.540
how long it's gonna take.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.500
So let me put exception handling around that.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.740
I hate writing exception handling code.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.580
I hate it.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.860
It's boring AF.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.500
And the fact that this thing can do it

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.940
is fantastic.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.940
Now, it never, when I do exception handling,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.580
I like to use the concrete class

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.940
and I have not gotten the GitHub pilot, Co-Pilot

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:21.480
to put in the correct concrete class yet.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.480
But you know what?

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.880
It taps things out.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.160
It gets the exception structure right.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.000
And sure, I spend three more seconds

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.940
to get the right class under.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.880
So yeah, I do like that aspect of it.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.960
Just like that last article I mentioned,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.880
is it gonna take it away not anytime soon?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.320
Gen AI won't do that.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.240
When or if the AGI comes into play,

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.440
and I don't know if we've talking about this.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.120
Open AI is on record thinking that an AGI

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.680
will exist within 10 years.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.760
Yeah, we did talk about this briefly.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.700
It's, yeah, this I think is probably the lead in

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.660
maybe to the, we're all gonna die episode of A-B testing.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.780
We're talking about AI.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.500
Can't remember, but we did mention this.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:24.840
Yeah, the, so winding back to...

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.640
Yeah, I mean, I think we,

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.200
anything else in the article you wanna hit like any,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.440
he asked for any comments and there they are.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.780
It's the article has a lot of good points.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.260
It's a head-naught or hire junior engineers,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.020
grow them into senior engineers,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.540
create a good, like here's the deal.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.460
I guess the thing is, it's easy.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.340
Like, I guess my comment around,

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.780
it's easy to generate code,

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.180
but not so easy to generate good code.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.820
I kind of think that that's kind of a bullshit subtext.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.660
I, yeah.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.660
Right, it's no.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.140
That's hard without Gen AI.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.640
And that statement is true without Gen AI.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.480
Right.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.880
And it also operates under the assumption

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.580
that that's really what you're trying to do.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.260
Now, the pointy-haired managers at certain companies,

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.820
you know what, they might be, right?

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:23.140
Again, I have seen, I've seen evidence of companies

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.460
even at Amazon.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.100
I try to remember where I saw this.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.100
It was a news report where, oh no,

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:35.100
the CEO came out basically at some thing saying,

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.940
hey, the Gen AI is coming to take your jobs away.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:44.500
And oddly, he meant it as sort of an inspirational message.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.340
Oh, Lord.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.700
Or he obviously didn't frame it right,

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.020
so he freaked out his entire dev staff.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.410
But it does make the stupid stuff go away.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:01.730
Whether or not, maybe that could be a fun exercise

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.570
to do one day.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:07.760
Maybe you and I, we could do a series of and go,

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.310
all right, I've seen Planet Money do a series

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:18.870
of using Gen AI to create a whole episode.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.970
Maybe it'll be interesting.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:22.790
You and I.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.270
We could have it, I mean, I could have it

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.510
create a script for us that we just read.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:31.950
No, well, and with their voice stuff, we could go beyond that.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:35.350
No, no, I was saying it might be a fun experiment

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:40.760
to say, all right, let's dream up a service

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:46.280
and let's see how far we can get Gen AI to design it.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.630
No, it might be good for, like if we're gonna,

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.270
we need to do that one as a cast

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.750
and put it on YouTube or something,

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.690
because people need to see some screens along with that.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:00.170
I'm wondering how long is it until one of us

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:04.130
can do the podcast without the other one?

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.420
Oh, I think.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.260
Like, cause it's there.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.100
So you kind of tried to do that and you're like,

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.300
oh no, without Brent, they call bullshit on me.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.420
This is boring.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.060
Well, again, but if I, look, if I need someone

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.700
to be confidently incorrect, I can use you or chat GPT.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:30.550
Sure, sure.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.590
I mean, I guess you just, you spend another couple hours

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.710
this weekend and come up with the right prompts.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.430
No, I'm not gonna do that.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.750
Okay, point is, read the article.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.030
There are our thoughts.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.470
We think that Gen AI isn't taking away jobs.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.010
You should hire junior engineers.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.550
You should have a diverse culture that you should,

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.510
like focus on, I was gonna say earlier

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.430
before you interrupted, like you gotta build good teams

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.990
and good teams will make good software

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:57.030
and they'll make it efficiently.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.790
You don't have enough people on the team

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.510
to get done what you need to get done

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.170
and they're gonna figure out,

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.990
like I'm full of tautologies here,

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.590
but if you build a good team and you focus

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:10.640
on their engagement and joy of their job,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.000
they're going to produce great software quickly

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.280
and yet everybody wins.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.920
Woo hoo.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.480
There is one last thing I'll say on this.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.320
Okay, fine.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.160
One last thing.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.480
And we'll see.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.330
Does it have to do with unicorns?

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.130
No, cannibals.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:26.890
No, cannibals?

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:27.810
Cannibals.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:28.930
Cannibals, gross.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.870
The section header is we need to stop cannibalizing

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.290
our own future.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.210
Ooh, that sounds harsh.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.050
And the very last paragraph.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.970
All of this speaks a deep misunderstanding

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.410
about what engineers actually do.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.550
By not hiring and training up junior engineers,

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.250
we are cannibalizing our own future.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.250
We need to stop doing that.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.750
Now, before you comment,

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:59.510
I will tell you this reeks of several of the messages

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:04.570
I heard when test was imploding.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.670
People proactively holding on to the old world

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.590
with white knuckles.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.830
I don't know if that's their intent.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.810
I'm going to choose to sort of be balanced,

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.110
but I think this whole article,

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:21.390
at least in terms of my own view of thinking

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.190
about the future and balancing human with the machine,

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.770
this article would have been much better

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.140
without this whole section.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.620
Because I'm just like, oh, it reeks of that protectionist.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.300
The way we've always done it,

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:41.350
it's the way we should do it that I don't like.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.870
Yeah, I get it.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.710
I get it.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.910
To me, I take it a little bit differently.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.670
I want to get into a couple of code of things here

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.190
before we end it for the day.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.270
But really, it's reading my LinkedIn DMs.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.270
I thought would be a fun segment

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.610
that I forgot I wanted to do.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.430
But I think what he's saying is

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.830
if we only focus on hiring seniors,

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.390
eventually we aren't going to have anybody

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.710
to grow into senior positions.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.270
And that's how we cannibalize ourselves.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:09.300
We have to hire the people that grow into those positions.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.060
So I don't have a sound effect for this,

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.780
but I don't know what your LinkedIn DMs are.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.780
I reply to if I know you, I reply.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.260
So I don't want people who know me,

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.420
who send me DMs to feel like they can't send me DMs.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.380
Of course I'll reply to them.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.420
But I get DMs all over the place

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.220
from people who have glanced,

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.020
well, they haven't even looked at my profile.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.900
What they've done is had an algorithm,

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.120
I don't call it AI,

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.180
something has scoured my profile

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.280
and found deep in the dark roots of my past,

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.890
the word test or the word estet.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.770
And then I get messages like this.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.150
And tell me what your answer would be.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.230
I'm not going to reply.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.490
Alan, I'm building a...

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.370
Fuck no, I'm thinking what my answer is.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:03.770
Let me finish.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.050
Alan, I want to give you $10 million.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.230
No, I didn't say that.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.250
Alan, I'm building a company

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.970
to help my customers achieve test automation

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:16.210
using their manual testers six times faster than Estet.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.280
I'm seeking blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.920
Is he coming to you for venture capital?

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.560
No, he wants insights,

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.520
but I don't want to talk about testing.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.680
At least he's not trying to sell it to me.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.920
But I don't want to talk about,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.350
like I'm tired of it because nobody gets it.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.550
I don't want to teach my manual testers to write code,

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.950
to write code, test code.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.030
I want my developers to write test code.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.470
Yes, that's exactly where I was going.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.550
I refuse to be part of that system.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.830
I'm like, it's not the answer.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:52.670
A bunch of testers writing Selenium all day

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.710
is not the answer.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:57.390
Teaching my manual testers air quote to write automation.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.150
I don't care how many, look,

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.670
I'm sure your company is great.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.550
And I'm sure you have a market for people you can use,

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.750
but it's not for me.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:05.590
It's not for me.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:10.590
Teach your manual testers to write test automation

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.910
and dev code better than your Estets.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.750
And all right, I'm in.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:18.710
Let's talk about that.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:22.270
And again, you get the mountain I'm on.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.790
We have studies showing,

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.670
studies not just my anecdotes, which are absolutely valid.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.310
We have studies showing that tests owned by developers

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.670
have a higher correlation with quality than other tests.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:39.830
Yet we pay these test teams to write automation,

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.570
like an unhealthy amount of UI automation

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.770
for the development team.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.330
And I just,

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.000
the inability of people to learn and adapt to,

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:01.270
and grow, like, I don't know, like Dan Pink was right.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:06.660
The future is right brain, creative people.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.660
If you are a fixed mindset and you don't want to learn,

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.980
and you don't want to do new things,

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:18.270
and you don't want to be creative in your job,

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:19.550
you're useless.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.280
In software, in software,

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.120
you are, you have plenty of other jobs you could do.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.040
Go work in a button factory.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.990
Uh, go work at anything that's assembly line work.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.910
Yeah.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:39.750
Right?

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.270
Button factory, door knob factory.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.320
Yeah, I don't.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.840
I just, I'm blown away.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.720
I was talking to, I was talking to a former employee of mine

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.440
who I moved to enroll in another team.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.280
And well, it didn't go well.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.200
Today was their last day.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.200
And I was talking to them and they said,

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.000
they're just blown away the fact that

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.140
there are people in the software industry who like,

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.420
like there is so many new things to learn.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.660
Like, Brent, you and I have been in this,

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.100
like, like a combined 150 years.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.820
And every day, every week we find new things to learn,

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.460
and we're excited about those things.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.340
And it's that learning and new things that keep us motivated.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.700
And there are people that I just,

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.800
I just don't get why there are people who don't want to learn.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.040
So anyway, backing up to this thing.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.160
Uh, I know, I, sure.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.000
I believe in you.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.440
I just want to be no part of having testers learn,

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.660
like having manual, like I,

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.420
tell me how you're going to help developers

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.540
write better tests.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.340
Tell me how you're going to accelerate software development.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.660
Tell me how you are going to speed up the feedback loop.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.080
And I will talk to you any day of the week, any time.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.920
Right. And, and to me, okay.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.840
So you can make manual testers faster than Estes, right?

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.280
For me, it's okay.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.680
How can you use that same tech to turn the Estes

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.280
into better developers?

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.410
Like, um, it is still something that I have,

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.870
I've mentioned on the podcast a billion times.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.550
When you take someone who's in suit,

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:35.550
who is competent at testing and move them into a dev role,

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:40.130
they become the developer.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.340
They're the modern developer.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.180
Yeah.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.820
It's, um, they are just simply, uh,

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.000
better in all ways that I can think of measuring.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.020
Uh, and if there's a strategy along those lines,

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.940
great, I'm a board, right?

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:03.100
In terms of like the one line pitch that you just talked

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.540
about, yeah, it's fine.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:09.060
They, they meant, they meant well, but their demographics

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:09.980
is just screwed up.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.340
They absolutely targeted the wrong person.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.060
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:18.300
All right. Well, that is AB testing for today.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.180
I remain right. Blaine Allen.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.620
And I'm.
