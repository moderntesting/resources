00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:11.900
This is the AB testing 343 podcast a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.380
three questions about almost anything

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.180
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.030
Hey everyone. It's been a long time. We're back for an ABT

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.390
343 where we asked one of our three podcast listeners three questions about themselves and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.530
today we have the I think world renowned but we'll let him speak to that but we have

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.770
Danny fought here. Hey Danny. Welcome. Hi there. I think the world has mostly forgotten about me, but

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.710
Thanks for that shout out. I I do not think so. I do not think so. I

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.510
Have some questions for you, but I want to establish some context first

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.390
Well, actually first even before I get to the context question the pre pre question is how are you doing?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.870
How are you surviving the work from home and the pandemic and all of those things? I

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.870
Am doing great. I love working from home

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.290
I've done it full-time before and I'm doing it, you know practically full-time right now

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.930
I'm doing great and I can't really I feel bad saying that because some people aren't doing great

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.470
So I just got a promotion at work. I'm doing better there than I ever have before

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.990
Congratulations. Thank you

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.310
I had put for all those people who are looking for a job, you know, I feel for you. I'm sorry

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.270
So I can't feel too good about my successes, I guess

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.750
But yeah, I am doing great except for you know

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.270
Worried about staying alive and my friends and family, you know staying alive and healthy

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.320
it sounds like we're in a lot of the same boat and I have to remind myself and and I don't have to anymore but

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.160
I just remember that's what I meant to say. I remember that I am in a very privileged position right now

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.640
Where I can work full-time from home our company my part of the company especially is doing well

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.440
better than expected because people are home playing games and

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.380
I'm just in a very fortunate position. So I'm thankful for that and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.300
Again job going well here and trying to stay alive. So

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.120
What is it just for some context here's the actual pre-question

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.460
What do you do?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.930
What kind of what's the cat give me and the listeners some context on?

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.060
What's your day-to-day like or however you want to describe it? Well first I want to mention in terms of privilege

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.380
I am an old white man and what the heck am I doing here?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140
Someone else could be here

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.340
increasing our diversity

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.980
And I am proud that we've had some good diversity on AB 2 3 4 3

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.660
But every once in a while we do have an old white man on so so yes

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.090
Make sure we aren't exclusively old white men

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.530
Okay, good. If there's anything I can do to bring people up and then I'm all ears. I'm trying to figure out how to do that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.790
exactly

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.890
So what what do I do?

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.850
And it's I think thanks to you really and and Brent

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.090
My title that I give myself on LinkedIn is I am a software generalist

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.030
I do whatever needs to be done. Whatever people are willing to pay for basically

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.610
so I

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.170
Try to do those unique things that no one else is doing or is willing to do or knows how to do

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.370
So that's the snarky answer

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.010
What do I do day to day just in the last month or so I'm a developer

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.110
Senior developer, I guess was my title recently changed to squad lead

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.890
So I'm also kind of helping work flow through a squad right now

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
so and this is a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.370
Devopsies kind of team so we do all kinds of different things so many different things

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.400
That I can't even learn how all these tools work that we have to do both to develop features and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.080
Get them tested get them out the door and ask ourselves. Are they working or not? Just

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.600
So many different tools. How can I possibly learn how they all work and how to fix them when they break in production?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.530
So it's different every day

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.690
Yeah, the trick I found is you don't have to know how all the tools work

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.970
You have to be willing to learn how they all work when needed

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.990
Yeah, I'm very willing but for the first time I'm feeling overwhelmed

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.790
I'm willing to learn one or two new tools, but this is this is a lot of new tools and they're changing

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.550
Constantly some of it is cost-cutting as many companies are reducing their costs

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.870
I mean we were doing this before the pandemic and before our

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.150
Customer base dropped by a very frightening percentage, but you know certainly even more so now

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.030
So that means the tool we just sort of learned. Well now it's a different cheaper tool

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.790
It is a bit even for me and I welcome change in new things is even for me. It's getting a bit overwhelming

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.670
yeah, as you know, I run a DevOps team is for my organization at Unity and

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.990
We have had a few of those come our way, too

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.170
And they usually involve a migration that my team has to run and man are we tired of migrating stuff

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.370
So I think we finally have the big one behind us, so we're pretty happy about that

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.440
Oh, yeah, I forgot about the the migrations are part of that from one part of the cloud to another part of the cloud

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.360
Because the first place we want it wasn't really the right place and now it needs to be this other place. Oh my goodness

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.160
Yeah, we did one a while back which was moving

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.620
Well, we thought I don't to be abstract. We changed cloud providers. We moved from AWS to GCP

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.260
Google gave us a good deal. I guess I don't know. We just did it

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.600
Cool

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.100
We talked about generals Brent tonight do and I always call myself a specializing generalist or a generalizing specialist

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.180
I forget which one I go back and forth and

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:20.080
I know you have a background like I do being a testing specialist

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.660
So I'm curious. What do you miss about being a testing specialist? And

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.120
Yeah, what do you miss about being a testing specialist? What do I miss about being a testing specialist?

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.300
Well, I guess a couple of things

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.460
I miss breaking things on a daily basis. I still get to do some of that because

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.140
You know, we are our own QA and

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.700
Occasionally I get to bring up a load test tool where you know, that's where you can really break something

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500
And so that's always fun

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.100
I miss the community. I mean it's still there most of the people I follow on Twitter are still

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.540
Overwhelmingly in the testing QA community

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.060
I'm slowly trying to expand my network more in the development area

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:14.180
And I'm finding that I don't think there is quite that tight-knit community. There might be around a particular technology

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.140
but

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.500
You know just a general community of practice out there in the world

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.260
I'm still trying to find some of those to support what I'm doing right now

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.540
So I do miss how tight-knit that testing community has has always been really

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.940
But in terms of being a tester

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.740
I

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.220
Can't say I really miss that

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.140
Very much, you know besides the fact that breaking things is great

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.180
I'm doing okay with what's going on right now and the fact that when I ran that load test

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.020
I saw this null pointer exception. I didn't file a bug report. I just fixed it and

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.340
Committed the code. So that's that's something I like more about what I'm doing now is I don't have these artificial

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.860
Boundaries on what I can and can't work on

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.500
Yeah, that's good that it's just tightening up the feedback loop. I think I heard this discussion

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.660
It was a while ago maybe years ago

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.170
that probably on Twitter because I think we follow a lot of the same people and

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.770
Someone was talking about like why isn't there I guess you could say stack overflow as a developer community

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.610
But it's it's huge and and it's not really a community

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:31.010
Yeah, I blogged about how that's difficult to get into and and to get the reputation to be even allowed to post the kinds of things

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.090
You want to post?

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.040
Yeah, it's funny. I have an ever-growing score on

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.360
Stack overflow and even a few of the other

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:47.100
similar sites from questions I answered years ago, I probably haven't answered a question anywhere on any of the

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.230
overflow sites in

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.510
As long as I can remember but ever but everyone's while I go back I see oh my score went up by 100 points

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.390
Let me see why and just more up though. It's on the same, you know, 20 questions. I probably answered in my life

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.020
Well, yeah, they stay around a long time

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.300
Don't they do and I do I can't say after I blogged about that about how it's just really I just gave up

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.300
I'm trying to get into that community

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.200
There was this big announcement from stack overflow that they were making changes to make it easier and you know

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.200
That's probably because of me. I'm pretty sure

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.920
Actually, it could be could be not that world renowned but it's fun

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.400
I will I will add it to your Wikipedia entry as an accomplishment

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.400
So it can be deleted a few weeks later as soon as anyone finds it. Yeah, I've been through that not my own

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.040
But others that I've added. Yeah, I went through tangents because they're allowed anywhere with this related ABT

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.920
I went through you might have seen this a while ago

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.240
I kind of changed gears on this but went through an effort to try and clean up the software testing Wikipedia page

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.820
Oh, yeah, I joined in that effort and did a little bit of work there and I think Noah

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.460
Had a good suggestion what to do with that. Just let's just

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.570
Let's just define a set of soccer a soccer wear

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:10.250
Let's have a Wikipedia page on agile testing and maybe we can actually get use that as a place to talk about the way

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.270
Most of us are doing testing and leave the software testing page to those folks

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.870
But that page is the software testing pages a lot of changes get rejected

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:25.410
And I'm friends with the main rejecter and so, you know

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.690
You know you engaged with the people you're arguing with you didn't rather than the waging war

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.730
I mean we even got him to join our select channel

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:37.550
Yep, which is now pretty much dead because I haven't paid attention to it and that's fine because I'm okay with where it's at

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.710
I made some changes that really bugged me and

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.130
and

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.210
Yeah, I haven't checked that in a while

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.810
anyway back on track so

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:52.570
You and I have both although I left test and then kind of fell back into it when I first joined Unity and then fell

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.490
back away from it, but

00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:01.210
So you're a successful developer now successful Generals developer, which in my opinion makes the best developer

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:07.370
Do you wish you would have moved there sooner? Do you wish you'd have moved out of testing and into development sooner in your career?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.650
I actually do

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:17.410
I think I have limited myself by identifying so strongly as a tester and

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.650
You know, I've talked about this at the online test conference at the presentation I gave there

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:29.010
I mean that was just really that was who I was I break things and I'm an underdog

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:35.130
You know QA people don't get respect, but that's who I am and I just latched on to that for for way too long

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.510
Really, I mean when I consulting business

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.830
I was an independent consultant for several years when that was faltering it didn't even really occur to me

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:49.750
Maybe I should apply for development jobs or get some some programming contracts. I'd been a programmer

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.430
Since before I was a tester

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.390
But I don't know why I just I was just so locked into that identity as a tester

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.870
That I couldn't get out of that box and I wish I had my consulting business might still be alive if I've done that

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.490
So yeah

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:12.530
There's so many more opportunities if your title is developer that I really have stunted my growth

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:18.570
I'm having great fun now. I'm the old guy and where I work. I'm very glad they don't they don't really seem to discriminate

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.130
based on being the guy with

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.170
gray hairs in his beard

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.010
Which is great, but man if it had been ten years ago

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.210
That would be so much more I could grow from there

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:35.110
You know Brent moved away from QA before I did I think at Microsoft and

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:42.210
I'm sure he would make the same claim and there are some things I think he probably the same claim as well that

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.440
Some things around systems thinking I could never have got from

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.120
Without being a tester about seeing the big picture and understanding how pieces work together

00:12:53.020 --> 00:13:02.360
Understanding how software is delivered and then basically I think it helped you become the generalist you are today is what I would say I

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:08.850
Want to also dig in on one thing you said because it struck a nerve or a memory

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.510
Because we do see today

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.670
Because times are changing more and more

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:22.120
Companies are using fewer test specialists and there are people who cling to that test role. It's their identity

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.660
And I'm just curious if you have a message for those people. Oh

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.260
goodness, I mean I could just be

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.140
I

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.780
Could I could do the hard sell and barely be a butt-head and I could say test is dead

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.780
It was kind of my message at the online test conference is you get out while you can and that that is kind of my

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:50.220
My message is get out get out while you can but the fact is a lot of people are still

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.640
Gainfully employed as testers. There are people getting jobs as testers for the first time and

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
You know, they're probably gonna be okay

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:06.020
Just fewer of them are gonna be okay than before I can't analyze what those numbers are gonna be

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:11.680
so my personal choice in terms of career opportunity was to broaden it and

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.600
I still recommend to people that they take a broader outlook than being a testing specialist

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.780
But also I've worked on trying to train

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:27.420
QA people to pick up development skills. I have been successful in that once

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.520
I'm very proud of that that person is still working here

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.340
and

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:40.620
You know, I don't have a good count on how many of them didn't make that transition there are some that made it to other

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.620
roles, but

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.780
I would say a pretty big majority of of testing specialists are not

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.400
Programmers already and don't want to be programmers and if it's not a job that they would enjoy

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.530
It doesn't really make much sense to try to do it. Yeah, I forgot what the question was

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:06.830
We can we can go here for a while because while you were talking about being a generalist and testers and testing

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.310
I think what I would encourage a tester to do based on what you said in my my

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:19.050
Interpretation of it is be more of a generalist. Don't be a testing specialist have a test specialty, but be a generalist

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.970
It doesn't have to be programming

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.090
I think of all the other things that go out in the DevOps world

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:29.510
Which may require some configuration files that may look like code, but there's so much

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:36.410
Technical work and I'm not getting into the whole technical versus non-technical. That's a that's a rat hole not for today

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.410
Because all of our work is technical. Anyway, there's

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:46.570
Hooking up static analysis tools adding a tool to a CI system

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.180
All these things help out a lot with quality

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.180
But they're not testing

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.540
One thing I was curious you think about this. I think one thing I would encourage testers to do is

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.020
Be a tester be the testing specialist if that's your identity

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.800
I'm not I don't want to take that away from you, but I think you are going to be

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:15.700
You're gonna guarantee a better career. I think and maybe have some more fun if you try and generalize a little more as well

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.540
What do you think about that advice that I just made up on the spot?

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.500
Yeah, that's great. And I can tell a story about that because I actually

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.300
earlier on I

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.540
Went away from testing when my consulting business

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:36.300
Dried up and I got a call from a recruiter who said hey, do you want to work in doing?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.480
Technical support basically and I said no I'm a tester and then I looked at my finances and I called him back and said

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.480
Yes. Yes, I do

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.720
So I did that and I did

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.560
for a while and

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.280
for reasons I left that several years later and

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.640
Went straight back to testing because that's what was easy to do

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.180
I

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:07.120
Did that at a couple there those lasted like three different jobs lasted about a year and and for various reasons

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.660
needed to move on to

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.490
to something else and

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:16.010
Then my place I'm at right now. There was an opening as a QA analyst

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.810
I've never had that job title before my whole career. It's always been

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.850
You know some sort of engineer

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.690
But you know, I swallowed my pride

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.110
I really liked the company and I said, all right, I'll be a QA analyst. It's contract

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.590
So, you know, whatever let's give it a try and for one I was surprised they hired me

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:38.910
No one said overqualified or anything like that. They just said sure. Yeah, you're qualified to do the job and

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.910
Started talking to some of the developers on the team

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.270
because

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.270
You know, this was I guess you would call it

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:54.270
Combined engineer. I don't with the mic, you know, Microsoft term is the Microsoft term was combined engineering

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:59.770
Okay, Brent and I preferred unified. It's like oil and vinegar versus ranch dressing

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.570
It's it's the way that you do things if you have testing specialists

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.050
That's kind of the way I look at I didn't even really think it was weird that I wasn't on a separate testing team

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.090
We were on a team a couple of testers a couple of developers

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.690
Yeah, it was just just made sense. But anyways, I started talking to some of the developers. I said hey, you know, I

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:23.410
I think I see a security vulnerability here and let me show you how to set up a debug proxy

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.550
modify

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:30.870
The the output that's coming in. Oh, look, you know, here's here's this issue here and you want me to dig into it further and

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:37.270
It turns out one of those guys was pretty influential in the organization and

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.230
You know before long I got this offer said hey you need to do something

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:47.750
Like like at least like test automation or something else and so I was able to move up from that pretty quickly. So

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.550
You know, I think that kind of fits in with what you're saying

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.850
I was in a testing specialist role and

00:18:53.730 --> 00:19:00.450
But I had other skills and I found places to use them and without me even trying that led to something else

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:08.810
Now I don't recommend the testing specialist to test automation specialist path and I think you've mentioned that several times before

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.510
And by the way at my company, not only do we not have QA people anywhere in my organization

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.850
We don't have automation specialist either

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.980
So that was also a bit of a dead end

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.540
So yeah, definitely if what you're doing is mostly testing

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.900
You don't have to change your job title to expand your skills and use some of those skills

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.640
Yeah, the titles really don't mean anything

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:41.360
It's about being willing and eager to try different things and try to help in different ways and and just

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.700
that attitude for me of always learning, you know, we talked to to merit on the

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.860
the A.B. Testing podcast a few weeks ago and

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:56.180
She came across and I described her as being addicted to learning and I think something a

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:03.340
Any generalist actually any knowledge worker should also embrace because that's gonna keep you

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:09.880
Well one employed but more importantly gonna keep you engaged and keep you having fun

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:15.900
I mean talk about privilege not only are we still able to make money during this pandemic and pay our bills

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260
But we get to do something we like

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.590
It's fun to do you I have to follow merit. That's not fair

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.990
Like the best one you've done I can't I can't follow that

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.110
Not that there'll be an A.B. Testing after that Brett and I did a

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.650
Recording this morning. And by the way our first ever live stream we decided

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:42.640
Right at 8 o'clock. We recorded that I was gonna live stream it. So I was wondering why people were commenting on that

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.900
I missed out

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.440
But in terms of learning, yeah, I was I was thinking about what am I learning right now and

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.100
Goodness

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.080
I've started a couple of

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:02.460
Tracks at work. They're very big on learning. You know, I just spent basically every Friday afternoon is learning

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:08.740
Don't work on any user stories unless that helps you learning. That's our mandate to our whole organization and I love it

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.180
That's nice. So I'm using that to improve some of my programming skills while also

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.400
pushing forward a

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.920
Technology initiative that the whole company is gonna be able to benefit from

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.880
But I also just a few days ago started a music theory course on that same platform the company sponsors

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.880
but you know in my own time

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.520
I'm on a

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:40.660
More than 310 day streak on duolingo learning mostly French but not entirely

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.320
I'm not bragging on that

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.280
I just I don't know I made a habit and and that once I make a habit it tends to stick and

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.120
I'm sure I'm missing something else. Yeah, I had like a

00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:00.450
50-day streak on duolingo a while back and then I said I missed a day. I never went back

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.030
I feel really bad now. That's too bad. It's not too late to start another streak

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:11.030
I know with a different language in different language every time. Yeah, I've tried four or five. Yeah, I

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:18.170
Had to tell an employee just this week's for about this learning Friday. I had to tell him it's okay

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.910
To read this book. I asked you to read during the work day

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.960
Encount it as work. It's like really I said, yeah, you can even see you have to sit at your desk

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.840
You can sit on your couch and read this book. I want I want to discuss it with you and etc. Etc. It's okay

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.320
I can do that. That's weird. I said no, it's not weird. This is this is this is life

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.760
Sit on your couch read the book. We'll talk about it next week. Yeah, it's weird that it's weird

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.600
But yeah, I used to find a little out of the way corners away from my work area back when I worked in

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:57.980
An office with other people I would go hide and so I could read without being interrupted and then the team made a game out

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.140
Of it. I found you that time. Well fine, but you just keep on walking because I'm gonna keep reading

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.020
Speaking of books I hear a rumor that you're writing a biography

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.230
Tell me about that

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.830
It might become what you would call a biography I suppose

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.670
so

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.810
Yeah, the friend of mine Jerry Weinberg

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:27.850
We it started on a tweet of his that piqued my interest in basically computer history

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.290
You know political history the kind that you have to do in school and get a grade on

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:38.490
Not not super interesting but computer history. Oh my goodness and history of other interesting things

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:44.370
That that's really cool stuff. So I got to talking about that and I said, hey Jerry

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.410
why don't you write a book because you were there like

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:52.110
The first computer that was ever delivered to San Francisco as far as we can tell

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:57.070
He was the first person to get his hands on it and figure out how to program it

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.630
and that's just amazing and

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:05.590
It turns out I wasn't the first person to say hey Jerry, you should write a book and I didn't know at the time

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:10.230
But this was his pat answer and the answer was no you should write a book

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:16.650
Because how could he write all the books that everyone says he should he's he already wrote like 40 plus books

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.130
Give the guy a break, right?

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.940
About probably 20 them over my bookshelf. Yeah. Yeah, it's good stuff

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.020
And so few people know about Jerry Weinberg and you know

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.740
The psychology of computer programming and secrets of consulting and are your lights on so much good stuff

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.980
In fact one of secrets of consulting because my my organization

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.080
In addition to DevOps a lot of folks that work across the org, but it's one of the four or five books

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.960
I'll show you they won't see it

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.600
But it's always on my always on my table because I just I show people say read this book. Oh, yeah

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:58.440
Good stuff. He told me that that should actually it was the more secrets of consulting should have been the book that went with

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.400
I think it's the chain shop workshop

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:07.160
But it was still new at the time and he hadn't switched over but man that that's to get the blue book

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:13.100
That's to get the blue book to the the second secrets of consulting book. It's on the bookshelf. Awesome

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.660
So our discussion it kind of morphed and and I realized you know this

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:24.620
This might be more interesting so many history books have been written already about computer specifically even

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:31.660
Let's just make this a biography and he said yeah, if you write it, I will answer your questions one at a time

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.900
and I'd be glad to contribute and so

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.280
That's how that got kicked off and I've got hundreds of pages of emails between

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:46.860
Jerry and mean at this point by the way, he was so rude as to die in the middle of this project

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040
Dang it

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.520
So now I'm continuing on by talking to people who knew him and can give me more information

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.800
About him and I'm still filling up another hundreds of pages document that somehow I have to wrangle

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.360
into some book chapters right now, it's really just a blog post and

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.000
I'm hoping this is gonna spur me to get one out. I've been working on one for more than a year now the next installment

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.640
I'm getting really

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.040
Really close on it. I've just been a little stuck and and I've read several books in the process

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.080
Once I realized that I'm really getting into the computer history part here

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.480
That was really why I got started on this and I want to get I think I've got an angle on it

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.420
It hasn't really been published before about this crucial transition point between

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.260
Well, you know what just just come to my blog and bug me about why I haven't posted it yet and you'll find out

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.620
Give you a cliffhanger there. I am

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.180
That's so exciting. I'm so happy you're doing that

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:57.340
I'm talking about I'm not sure I'm not sure the order some I need it's like the chronological order

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.480
The all of Jerry's books came out in but I know you probably have more than I do

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.720
But I have a copy of humanized input, which is

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.520
It's like typewritten. The printing is like it's a super cheap publication

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.720
But I know that was pretty early on but it's still really valuable. He had a way of writing

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:24.180
Information that just it's amazing how applicable it remains

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.070
It's all about it again. It goes back to systems thinking. It's all about

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:33.670
Trying to figure out what the real problem is and solving that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:40.330
I think I have every one of his books at least one edition of every single one and

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:47.410
a big bibliography where I'm trying to just list all of them and that is a challenge because he's

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:52.450
republished them he split them into several ebooks is this the same book is that and

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:59.310
Some of his books don't have an ISBN or even a publication year. Come on. How long?

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:09.190
Give me something to go with here so I can identify what this thing is in a bibliography. So it's been a challenge

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.910
But yeah, I think I've been able to acquire

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:19.110
Every single one and I got started on that when I was researching the triangle problem that everyone thinks Glenn Myers

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:25.490
First wrote about but Jerry told me that no I taught that to Glenn and it's in a book

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.490
I can prove that I published it first and I found this book

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:33.490
I think it might have been PL one or somewhere around that era and I

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.850
I got this search going at a used bookstore and sure enough

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.730
I got a hit on it and I bought the book and there it is the triangle problem before Glenn Myers wrote about it

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.650
Wow, and I feel like I've heard that did you blog that story?

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.930
I'm sure I did somewhere. Okay. Yeah, I I think I recall

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.230
Hearing about that once a while back it tickles a memory

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.860
Which could just be my memory playing tricks on me, but I feel like I had heard that

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.160
Maybe I am world-renowned if Alan Page has read one of my blog post

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.560
No, I read way too much you can know from my five four Fridays that I post I I read I

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.300
Read a lot of stuff. Sometimes I skim some stuff

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:20.000
There's usually a half dozen or a dozen articles a week where I really spend time on and they you know, I believe

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.870
That good ideas come from getting a lot of ideas and throwing the bad ones away

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:30.230
And also that good ideas come from other other ideas meeting. So I will read

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.020
it could be articles around

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:40.580
science or data analysis of Covid or software engineering or testing or systems thinking or

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.340
management or leadership

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.860
I'm always looking for ideas and not and also

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:54.060
For the critical thinking aspect things I disagree with so I can think about why I disagree with them

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.340
And so it helps me understand then from if I don't disagree with an article

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.260
Understand what's important to me or at least understand why I don't like it and I could do a big

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.920
soapbox on that but I read a lot because it I

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.980
Like merit. I like to consider myself addicted to learning. I want to get I'm not nearly at her level of

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.640
attacking learning but I

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.680
I

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.840
Want to take advantage of a brain that still works as long as I can

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.620
Awesome. Yeah, and what I'm doing right this second is part of that learning is volunteer to do something

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.380
I don't know. I don't know what I got to what I can present for that

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.780
But I just sign up for it now

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:38.540
I'm committed and that gets the gears turning and it took a while to figure out what do I want to talk to Alan about?

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.340
I know I've been wanting to talk to Alan for a long time

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.800
You know that's having that deadline. It's on the calendar

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.160
You got to talk to Alan about something and you know, you're bugging me about what's the agenda?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.920
That's typical of what I do

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:57.640
I'll sign up to speak about something at a conference and it's not something I have no idea about but but probably not something

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.440
I know enough to really talk about and that's what spurs me to go learn it

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.280
It's a challenge to go learn it. That is a fantastic attitude and we managed to

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.160
Fill up an ABT 343 with I think some

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:16.540
Information the listeners are really going to appreciate especially the the biography work you talked about that's it. That's

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:23.500
That's gonna cause a buzz. I think cool. Yeah, let me know what you think about it. Tell me which parts you don't like, please

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.100
How can I improve on it because it's still very much a work in progress

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.160
I'll grab some more information after I say goodbye here, but let's say goodbye to our listeners

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.160
thank you for spending some time with me and

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.800
answering some questions and

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:42.460
Hope to hear from you more on one of the three dot slack comm and I will be following your blog closely

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.780
So thanks Danny. Thanks. Goodbye to all two of you. I'm one. So there's only two others listening

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.860
It's only two others. They'll enjoy it though. I promise

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.490
cool
