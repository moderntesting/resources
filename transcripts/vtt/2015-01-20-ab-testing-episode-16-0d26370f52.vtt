WEBVTT

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.800
Everybody hi, hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we're back again

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.300
For the a B testing podcast what episode are we on here?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
Well, I actually had to look up that this time Alan and we're 16

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.140
You had to look it up because there's a number too big for you to count

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.400
It's too high for me to keep in my head. That's that's excellent

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.860
Excellent job there Brent and our first episode of 2015. Yes

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.800
Look at that. Hey, happy new year everyone. It is it spent a month

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.760
We took the holidays off and what you doing your holidays Brent? I

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.320
did

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.320
very proactively

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.500
Nothing. I was very forcibly doing nothing

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.020
It was fantastic

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.960
Wow, I'm impressed. I was hoping to draw a little bit more out of you. No, no

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640
I did it was hard to do like family wanted to do things

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.520
Did no work. I'm on my couch work my lazy boy recliner

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.360
You know

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.560
I've actually thought about going out and buying a lazy boy recliner

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.720
We want to we want to upgrade the the our living chair

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.680
We want it well, we want to upgrade our living room, but that would have violated my principle of doing nothing

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.310
So it was fantastic. It was um, so we had a big release just before the holidays

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.230
Power bi is the the team I'm on we have now

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.360
several new features and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.400
Those features are all free. So if those who are interested in the the power bi space you can go create

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.880
use our new set of features and

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.200
Go create your own account for free and start messing around with power bi dashboards. It's a fantastic product

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.280
But it took a lot out of us to build it and so by I shut up

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440
Matter of fact, I had to do a password change

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:38.620
You know, you know how our past

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.500
Data with the bifurcation double ginger of the globe. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep. We can do that in a whole bunch more

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.260
That's awesome. I did a lot of junk and did nothing we didn't

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.060
Try well, gosh, we did travel. I ran a 12k

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.520
The 12k is a christmas run. I finished without puking. That was nice took me just over an hour

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.200
So I was happy with that

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.400
Okay is five miles six miles eight miles eight miles. I was and in fact, it was so much fun

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.060
that I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.740
In a fit of stupidity that I will sure i'll hate myself for later. I'm gonna do a half marathon in march

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.850
Um around this march this march around murse around

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.570
You have support staff?

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.650
No, you have my phone number. So if you

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.810
I'm eight miles in and i'm doing fine. I just need a beer. I got your back. Alan. I'll be right there

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.890
And then sort of on uh, we had a nice holiday at the house and

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.410
Sort of a little bit of a whim the wife and I

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.410
Took off on new year's day for a quick trip to vegas

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.450
Oh, we saw oh the night we got there next night. We went to the final show the justin timber lake tour

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.930
And then and flew back the next day. So are you a a beat a big jt fan? My wife is

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.810
It was a good show though. It was it was done really well, but I was listening to the radio the other day and he is

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.240
Uh last year he was the number one or number two

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.780
um

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.020
Number one artist in terms of bringing money in I believe it. Yeah, like like and he's funny too billion dollars

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.470
one bajillion

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.470
Um cool. All right. So

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.870
Those of you that haven't turned off the podcast yet

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.910
Let's actually talk about software and this week because we've been gone so long and we actually had some feedback

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.630
Let's go right. Wait

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.990
So so actually before we begin there's there's there's one shout out I wanted to do

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.270
Those who are listening to the podcast

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.750
uh as well as a

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.870
blog post

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.350
Um, you guys have known that i've gone back to to school and i've actually surprisingly i'm halfway done with it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.520
Not really certain how where the time went

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.200
um

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.200
the but one of my

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.450
professors, uh

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.690
Uh just recently passed away

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.890
So I just want to basically shout out and say this this this man has been a key part of my

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.190
Uh personal growth towards my career trajectory

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.290
Very sad to see him go and I I really do hope that um

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.090
He rests in peace

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.090
It was actually very sudden. It was my my last class my last semester. He was my professor

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.050
And we were doing this conference call and he does a video call and he suddenly started coughing

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.450
And he and he mentioned just sort of uh at a hand that

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.850
He was gonna go see the doctor, uh the next day and

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.820
Turned out he ended up having uh lung cancer. He had never been a smoker. So it might have been a genetic version of it

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.410
And the word had been that he was coming back this next semester. Matter of fact the the class i'm taking now

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.890
He was supposed to teach. Uh, but um

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.330
January 8th, he passed on so

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.050
Uh professor, uh, if you are able to hear thanks

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.730
Uh, you have at least one student that appreciated what you did for him. Very cool. Yeah

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.530
Well, not cool, but thanks for the shout out. Yep

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.810
uh

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.810
so without further ado

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.090
Let's go right on to the

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.820
Mail

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.650
Wow, that was fantastic, you know, I I work on these so yeah we have and

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.730
by definition

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.370
Obviously, no one sends regular mail anymore

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.970
So there's no mail bag and people don't even send us email and often they don't even actually most the time

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.970
They don't post any comments

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.410
On the blog site or on itunes or stitcher or wherever

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.400
they usually tweet

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.520
Random things in the hallway. So the mail bag for us is anything any sort of interaction you have with us is the mail bag

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.520
Yes, anything that we can spend a half a second

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.960
And turn into an interesting question is a mail bag and we appreciate it

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.550
And once again those youth haven't turned everything off although we did have actually a mail from um,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.470
Jinsung

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.230
Oh internal this last time. So yeah, well that'll come up for that area

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.310
Yep, so first off I want to give a shout not a shout out a shout back

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.870
Uh, it's really cool. Um

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.590
Back in december just after our last podcast came out michael larson

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.750
Did a post on some of the podcasts he listens to and mentioned us pointing some people our way pretty cool

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.230
I think we were number one on the

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.610
I don't think it was I think it was alphabetical

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.640
Number one

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.360
That's why we start with a we're a a a a a b testing. We are number one podcast

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.920
In the in the so so anyway in the category of culture change for software testers starting with

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.480
Starting with the letter a

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:16.300
So so anyway, um, I got to meet michael four or five years ago at uh, um briefly at

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.460
Pnsqc conference down in portland and then i've been reading his blog for a long time

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.980
He did a great review of how he tests software at microsoft when it came out on his blog

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.940
But then just recently last month I had the blog post here so I can pull up the date here

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:34.860
Uh, he did a post on a on december 19th. No, that's actually the podcast one was on december 19

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.940
He did another post that i'm not going to look for right now, but but it was on

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.420
Now i'm gonna horribly paraphrase this but it's it's it's interesting

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.340
It was something like organizations of horror vacuum

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.240
and the story he told

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.320
was

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.480
Somebody at their company just left and they're the person owned all the vm stuff and he said well

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.800
I have some background there. I can I can jump in and

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:06.280
And sort of the moral being hey, you know, if there's stuff you can do go ahead and jump in which I fully believe in

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.040
So much so that it reminded me when I read it that the week before

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:19.150
There was some work that wasn't being done and and I love learning new things and jumping in on things and my superpower is I can learn

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.830
Things really quickly and I figured things out really well. So there was some work that needed to be done

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.440
And that'd be really interesting. So I lied I said, hey i've done something like that before I can help out

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.520
I said, oh great and I I

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.760
Did never done anything like it before but I knew I knew I could I knew I could learn it

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.200
It depends on how you abstract it. Yeah, I guess so i've worked on

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.360
products before yeah

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.040
I've i've

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.040
Yeah, yeah, i've uh, i've read words in english before I can do this. Yes

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.120
Now I mean

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.480
There's a sense of fearlessness that actually alan and I both share

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.160
um

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.200
I think we've been testers for too long to believe that that code is is anything

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Even remotely resembling magic

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.400
It's just another bunch of lines of code put together to solve things

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.660
Yes, it's not hard to figure out what it does and how to make it do the right thing. It's hard for some people

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.560
Not for me, it just takes diligence

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.200
Yeah

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.960
Anyway, I I related a lot to that because I did that all that post especially but from the recent ones because I that's exactly

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.480
What I do. So I

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.480
I like to

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.000
Uh, I like to be a generalist wait, which oh

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.520
Let's not let's not go there again. So anyway, thank you. Michael, uh his website

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.480
Uh mkl test head.com

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:51.000
Uh, and he's I believe mkl test head on twitter, but if i'm wrong, you probably already follow him

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.720
Anyway, so um, yep, I I I do follow, uh, michael and read his blog, uh quiet ops

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.780
Cool. Yeah, he's a great he's great

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.400
All right, let's get into oh, oh twitter conversation was this from gear in norway?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.000
Yes

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.680
About he thought it was we were talking about, you know, one-on-ones and coaching and mentoring and

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.560
He mentioned that in his workplace or in his culture

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.320
They the managers that just managers didn't do that

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:26.680
Yeah, the he he sent us a tweet and in his feedback was after listening to one of our podcasts

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:35.850
And I think it was some comment that I had made around um, the frequency in which I I talked through my guys

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.850
um

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.930
And he he found it, uh odd or befuddling i'm i'm i'm

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.570
paraphrasing here

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.570
uh to have management

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.770
that

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:53.210
syncs up with their employees on a weekly basis and in the even when as far as to say

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.550
uh

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:02.990
He found that like culturally odd like he was he was going to talk or ask around and see if any of any of his friends or co-workers

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.880
Experience such a phenomenon

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.300
All right. So what do you think?

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.640
I

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.800
The the opposite to you and I the opposite seems weird and it's not like you need and yeah

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.040
And this is one of those things where it's really easy to get the pendulum the wrong way and I see managers

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.640
who

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.560
Are so busy because they have these eight or nine direct reports

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.520
Want to meet with each of them for like an hour every week and sometimes the weird thing happens

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.400
Like we'll do an hour one-on-one a week and then you won't you just won't see them the rest of the time because you're

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.120
doing other managerial stuff and my

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.840
I'm not a manager, but my management style when I choose to be a manager is

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.280
The even more frequent shorter kind of check-ins. Yes, you have to have longer discussions around

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.320
Career and kind of what's going on when you need to dig deep

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.320
But i'm really big into the one-minute manager give get out of people's way

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.560
But dive in and find out what's going on and see if you need to intervene there was um

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.780
There was another on that same thread. There was another reach out

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.030
uh, or another

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:14.350
Another person I forget the name at the at this moment in time reached out and sent a thread

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.470
around sort of the role of a manager

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.590
and a belief that

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.550
A manager who holds on to the idea that they remain technical

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.120
was bad

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.440
particularly in the in the feedback context

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.600
And and I think the way to really address this feedback

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.680
problem

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.600
And I guess the third thing I would I would

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.080
Bring into play for those who have heard of it or not. Uh, there's there's this new sort of um

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.720
software engineering model

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.080
The way I'll wait till you're done. Sorry. Yeah that that

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.120
Zappos is really

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.120
What did they call it the holacracy? Yeah, it's holacr the holacracy

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:05.080
I was saying zappos is the primary example leverage throughout the but holacracy. There's no managers at all. So

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.280
Actually, and that was the thing when I first saw gears

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.420
twitter he's like

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.460
He was uncertain about this world where managers have one

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:22.140
Have weekly one-on-ones with him and I wasn't actually certain which direction he was talking from was he talking from the old school world where where

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.900
Basically managers get promoted because they're super technical and they suck at that actual job

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:34.540
Or more of the future world where there are no managers and he doesn't have sort of a command and control of or a head

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.540
He's expected to get feedback from when you look at we're gonna be all over the board on this because I have a whole bunch of ideas

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.780
on this yeah, that's the way, you know zappos is

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.460
Sort of famous for that holacracy culture and but

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.810
They don't have managers. This is I don't know which direction to go somebody signs paychecks

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:58.410
Somebody signs, you know off on purchase orders or whatever. So people do have authority to do those things

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.080
People don't report to each other

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.160
It can kind of work and I always thought I always

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.040
It's a great thought experiment to walk through. How would this work?

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.680
I'm going to talk through it when I think about any sort of complex concept

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.080
It helps me to think about extremes

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.560
Like what would it be like if there's no managers and whether I work at zappos not I can think about it

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.840
Well, somebody's got to step up and you're gonna have people

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.280
Now in a leadership role, I'm talking about

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.440
No, you already you brought up zappos. I'm going this direction. Okay

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.030
When you don't have any managers

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.060
People will still step up to lead you you're gonna get

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.380
Self-organizing teams. Yep, big believer and those are going to happen and

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.060
Want to force them to happen don't have any managers. Yep

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.260
They'll absolutely have to happen. You'll see that work out

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.980
And there are companies that have very few managers very flat and the same things happen

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.300
And there's not a lot of difference between a company with

00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:00.380
Very flat company with very few managers, maybe 10 20 reports. I don't know that the employee counted zappos

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.660
Where you're going to see that because the org is big enough

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.480
that manager's job

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.600
As the org gets flatter ends up being a lot more just kind of

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.320
Keeping overhead under control and I wonder if in I love the thought experiment because I don't know any of this

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.240
I wonder if in an organization with no managers where you do have people that kind of end up

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.040
in that same sort of role, so my you know

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.480
for example

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.840
I may

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:35.080
Be on the self-organizing team where the strength that I give to the team is kind of keeping everybody organized and

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.640
making sure the work is moving forward and

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.840
That people have someone to come talk to when they have a question around anything from how to do something to career

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:51.320
In many worlds. I would be the manager of that team, but i'm really sort of the self-organized will say leader. Yeah

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.000
The whining it back to to feedback though

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.450
So you pick you are are organizing the process

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.910
That the challenge in that world that in terms of exploring your thought experiment

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.000
is

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.400
How do you improve?

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.460
How do you?

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.460
How do you get better at doing that role?

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.940
Let's say that's something you go you sit back and you reflect and you say man

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.250
I am good at this

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.130
But now you have the challenge of how do you get better?

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:31.610
You go. I want a special I want to become a specializing generalist and this is where i'm going to spend my

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.570
specialization time getting better at

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.900
How would you do you look for opportunities where you can do that?

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:45.130
You look for challenges look for challenges. Sure. Say I want to I want to add performance, you know testing performance analysis to my

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:51.450
To my specialties i've never done it before but it seems really interesting and a friend of mine does and he's pretty good at it

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.250
the so i'm going to look for

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.770
Opportunities, you know, let me let me shadow you. You know, somebody else is doing this. Let me shadow you on this

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.330
Nobody else is doing it. I'm going to take some time to go read about it and and cope with some ideas

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:09.610
I can try on my own and i'm going to try things i'm an experiment and then as I get a little farther

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.160
I realize wow

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.760
I can do these performance activities, but to really understand what they mean

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.120
I need to understand a little bit more about statistics and how to analyze this data effectively so we can make choices

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.280
So i'm going to dig in a little bit there and if you want to get better at something

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.920
um

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.880
You need to learn it right you need to learn and practice. Yes and deliberate practice

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.040
So you need to grow your ability towards those challenges. Yeah, and and

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.760
the only thing the only

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.670
Advantage having a manager

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.490
Gives you if we're still talking about that thing. Yep

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.370
In that situation is

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.400
If you don't know where to go

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.840
You can ask your manager where you can go, but there's a weird there can be a weird code dependency there

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.400
Because you can ask anybody that doesn't have to be your manager. You can ask anyone that you need

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.060
You need a suitable means to discover what you what you don't know and what you don't know you don't know

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.420
Correct and that you need to leverage your team for that more than

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:15.340
You know or at least as much as I don't know where a manager the person you work for provides any additional advantage there

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.340
Let me let me ask you

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.700
One additional question. Oh, yes. I love you. Is this the bonus round?

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.900
It is. All right. You did well in the first round. All right

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.030
How would you know?

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.510
That you're not just blowing sunshine up your ass

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.910
How would you know?

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.230
That you are actually doing good versus

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.770
You thinking you are

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.650
The work I do needs to provide value to the product

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:48.010
Okay, and how would you know if it's doing because what you just described is that you're now

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:54.250
Uh, the way I kind of envision what you described you are the world's best as far as you concern

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.290
Are we making?

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.650
product decisions that improve the customer experience

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.050
and

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.450
Depending on your definition of customer. Yep, but are we making product decisions that improve the customer experience?

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:13.530
Based on the work that i'm providing to the team. Let me um, let me let me be more precise

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:22.330
Because like I believe you can do that and be good at organizing the process and still be pissing off everyone that you're working with

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.960
Yes

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.600
And that feedback I get where you're going. Probably important

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.960
Yeah, so how do you find out? Okay, so I I can figure out the work i'm doing is helping the product

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.760
But you're asking me. How do I figure out if I am doing it in a way that is?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.540
uh

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.220
I was gonna say socially acceptable, but how am I a good team member as well?

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:50.540
And we've talked about the things I value, you know on a team I work on i'm pretty straightforward, you know, does the work you do provide?

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.460
Value to the product. Uh, do you have what's your output?

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.180
Yeah, are you getting a reasonable amount of that work done and do you play well with others?

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.660
Yeah, those are when I look at someone I want to think how well you're doing I look at

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.700
Those things yes, and so how do I know if i'm playing well with others?

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.820
I always do no. I this is this is tying it back to awesome. I just know

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:23.740
Um, you can well in absence of a peer feedback system, which we've talked about before which I which I love and and sort of an ad hoc

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:29.900
Uh, if you can get people to really use one and rate people it's great. But ask people ask

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.460
If you don't have

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.460
A way to figure that out

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.020
I would ask people i've done that before

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.300
Um, i've asked someone to ask someone else about me if you're afraid to get that feedback directly

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.300
uh, but I really would prefer a sort of either

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.480
a

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.440
Feedback system could be anonymous or not or maybe even both

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.480
Uh, do you have an answer for that? How do how do you find out if you're pissing people off the actually you're always pissing people off

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.480
So, how do you find out when you're not pissing people off?

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.840
Uh, i'm also uh turns out i'm not pissing people off. Whoa, I'm pissing people off. Yeah

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.520
Particularly the times during the day where i'm sleeping and everyone else is nope pissing off

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.000
No, or hardly anyone at that time. Um

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.650
no, so

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:22.970
You just did a great thought exercise and and I think you kind of concluded that in a holacracy world

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:29.130
In order to to really succeed and not only as a team and a project

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:34.010
But when we're talking about a feedback system, we're really talking about the role of the individual

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.290
Mm-hmm and and how to help grow them

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.130
um

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.130
You you you have to have

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.170
Some sort of peer feedback tool and it turns out

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.890
holacracy acknowledges that

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.250
and um

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.250
You have to reduce the friction

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.930
Uh to enabling people to give

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.850
their

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.850
uh feedback

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.500
um

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.060
uh in a in a way that's actionable and uh nearly immediate

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.900
The the other thing most I have not seen

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.060
any article

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.500
That discusses holacracy in sort of a waterfall context

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:21.690
Right, uh, mostly most oftentimes you'll see holacracy. I'm going to say most currently i've it's all that i've seen

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.490
Uh are doing some sort of agile process

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:29.210
And agile, uh, one of the great benefits is it really tugs out

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.330
Transparency everyone knows what everyone knows

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.130
The in a holacracy world you really have to have collaboration

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.090
collaborative teams

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:46.490
Really helps to instill trust and that really helps to light up the sort of peer feedback mechanism

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.370
Going back to the other extreme though. Um talking about managers

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.930
right

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.930
I am a technical

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.890
manager, um

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:06.650
I I have gone through several years. Uh, i'm actually surprised honestly surprised when

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:12.650
My manager feedback scores are below. Uh 90 percent and it hasn't happened in

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.200
decades

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.940
the

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.940
the main reason why

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.420
I think most managers when when they go into that role and they stay super technical

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.260
It's because they don't understand the problem that they're trying to solve

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.240
Their their job isn't primarily to get the project across the wire

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.890
They have to do that

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.530
But it's it's more medium term long-term thinking

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.500
and and

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:45.660
Um, you cannot just do that without paying consequences. You will see your people going

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.300
Um stymieing you'll see your people getting to a point where

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:56.620
They're not getting support from you and they've kind of run to the end of of their ability to create a method

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.940
To get additional feedback and they move on

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.940
and

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:07.340
You can't do that. I I think you can't do that as a manager period but you absolutely can't do that in the software world

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.060
Because the number one asset

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.260
Is the knowledge that's between their ears?

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.580
And if you let if you let that go and you don't invest further in that you are short

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:26.300
Shrifting project acceleration. Did you say shrifting? I did I said short shrifting. What is shrifting?

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.900
Uh, that sounds like something that happens in a jail

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.220
I wish that's shiv shrift. I'm sure that I don't know

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.740
Uh short changing then all right, i'm gonna go with shrifting to make captain synonym here happy

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:47.500
Although you if the knowledge that's in their their heads and and allen's in another podcast he he's he's done

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.300
multiple

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:56.620
Discussions around the the importance of recognizing that we're not in the software

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.220
Industry we're in the knowledge worker industry

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.210
That we just happen to be using software

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:08.810
So the knowledge is the the primary asset therefore you're you're best motivated

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.490
to

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.650
Motivate and challenge and grow the person with that knowledge

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.210
And if you failed to do so, uh, you you better have a plan

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.490
For dealing with that knowledge leaving your team

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.540
And far too often I find these hyper technical managers either

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.880
uh

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.560
They they approach this as they're the guys that are going to do that

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.240
Or not. Let me give you a particular one

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:42.160
Quick story and then I think I think i'll end this topic. No, no, I I have more once you finally shut up. Okay

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.300
um

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.480
a manager

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.480
Years ago the best manager i've ever had

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.830
He shared with me his number one rule of of management

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.650
Okay

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.650
He's like if you do nothing

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.030
If you do nothing

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.630
You have to do this

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.070
and that is

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:07.150
Your task as a manager is to earn your team's loyalty

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.020
number one earn your team's loyalty

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.460
uh

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:19.420
You don't you can either be a technical manager or you can be a um, a people manager or you can be like me someplace in between

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.540
but whatever it is

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.300
And you can do this in any of those styles if you're a technical manager

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:33.660
Then that means you're helping them grow by look doing code reviews and in helping them think of other algorithms or or other

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.180
ways to solve the the problem via an architectural stance

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.220
But it means you can't just fire and forget

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.540
You can't say

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.620
Alan you will do this by tuesday

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.260
And then come tuesday go why haven't it been done? Although alan would get it done

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.000
um

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.760
Loyalty is everything

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.000
now

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.600
and i'll i'll just

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.960
years ago

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.960
Michael hunter blogged on this

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.000
For those who I think it's actually his last blog still

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.560
Um, he asked me to write up about the best bug i've ever encountered

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.720
And the best bug I ever encountered is when I completely screwed the pooch as a test manager

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.900
We had this product

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.370
We had these test plans of all the operating systems that we were going to work on

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.360
I had a team of 40 people

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.640
Uh, the dev team had a team of 20 people

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.040
Remember the days when test outnumbered dev?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.880
And that was so stupid and we had like five pm's and we still couldn't test quality in no

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.440
um

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.440
So we had a team of like 60 people

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.480
And long story short our product relied on dcom

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.500
and

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.500
We were going to ship with office

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.280
And they were on windows 95 or 98 that did not have dcom

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.960
And we didn't discover until after office greenlighted

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.310
That we didn't work

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.310
on on that os

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.520
And we never did

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.240
So we had gone through a series of interrupts and changing plans and in that whole process. We had forgotten to test on that os

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.400
Okay

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.640
As the the test manager involved and the one responsible for quality

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.240
If I had been my manager that day, that would have been my last day of this company

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.470
Think thankfully I wasn't and I was on my way

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:32.830
Um to go have a conversation with my manager because he needed to know

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:34.910
one of my

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:35.630
uh

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.510
Managers that reported to me knew what I was about to do

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.950
And he interrupted me and he said brit

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.960
Do not do what you're going to do. He's like, I I don't know what what are you talking about?

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.640
I was trying to own the message what what i'm not doing anything

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.890
He knew better

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.890
He said before you do anything

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:03.210
Go home sleep on it and if if what you are what I think you're about to do if you still want to do it

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:04.730
I won't get in your way

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.730
I said, okay deal

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.730
I came back the next morning

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.290
That guy came and talked to me

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.970
um

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.970
But he was still wearing the same clothes

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.560
He and my entire team

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.640
had done an all-nighter

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:29.440
Working with dev they found they fixed the problem. They did an entire month's test pass

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.520
in one night

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.770
And it was entirely

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.090
Because they didn't want me

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.360
to um fall on my sword which was

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.380
Absolutely what I was about to go do

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.640
um, oh yes

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.990
now

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.750
The thing I would say

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:53.470
When it comes to to giving feedback the most important thing is everybody needs to know

00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:01.310
What actions to take next and it and it doesn't matter if it's um, if it's a poor performing employee

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.630
Or it's one of your stars

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.630
everyone wants to have

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.030
Ideas and thoughts of what's the next thing I can do to improve myself

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.350
and a lot of the times

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.910
Managers, even if you have a manager doing weekly 101 so that doesn't mean it's going to be good

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.150
A lot of those managers all they do is adjectives

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.240
Right. Uh, oh, you're great. You're excellent

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.680
Uh, or you suck or you need to improve or any of these type of things

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.320
And it's not concrete enough

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.210
um

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.410
that's

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.850
My secret to success as a manager is you got to give them

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.280
um

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:47.400
An action you got to give them action ability you have to earn their trust so that you can actually tell them the truth

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.950
And they'll hear it

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.450
Anyway

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.410
You have more to say I I got so lost in there

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:58.650
So what is I think I figured out I had a question on what a technical manager was and it's

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.610
But I think you answered that part way through so that's good

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.170
Um, I think most managers

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.250
Yeah, we're kind of mixed

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.050
At least on the test side with whether managers are technical or not

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.810
But most I think most managers these days have are technical to some level

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.850
I wanted to jump on another extreme because what we're talking it reminded me of

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:23.210
Sort of the well, let me ask you this see if it gets where i'm going if not we'll see we'll all adjust

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.410
Okay

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:29.530
So we talked about holacracy and uh self-organizing teams. What's the opposite of that?

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:36.330
What's the other end of the spectrum describe the structure and just briefly of what would be the other end of an extreme on that?

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.120
uh, the the one that

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.760
The one i'm thinking of is is kind of when I was introduced to to management

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:50.490
I was told this rule of thumb for each employee you have you should be spending 10 of your time

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:56.570
uh working with that employee to improve them or to to

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.610
Talk with them is good. Even back 10 of your time is invested in them, you know

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.690
Yeah, looking at in some hand wavy thing is is basically that's communicated

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.530
Which basically means if you had back in those days if you had a team of 10

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.810
That's all you should be doing

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.930
Um, so I think that's that's the opposite extreme

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.740
Someplace where you have due to some team size and your accountability

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:29.820
That's all you do. Yeah, I wonder if so my take on that is if that's your and somebody may have that

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.900
that

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.740
Idea still in their head, but I wonder if your team really grows

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:41.500
It's kind of like you gotta set them free and my whole my one of my principles around

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.900
management is

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:49.100
Give people a framework they can work in and then get out of their way and then I combine that with uh,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.140
Sort of the one-minute manager concept. It's it's a nice little business parable book easy to read

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.300
I suggest you fly through it, but you just need to know when

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.460
to dive in and and when to intervene and and you do that by

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.580
Knowing what's going on in your team doesn't need to be uh,

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:11.820
You know a constant monitoring and sometimes people more monitoring than others, but it's it's not hovering either

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.100
It's getting out of their way until you need to be

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.860
Need to know what's going on I completely agree the

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.180
One of the speeches that I give often to my teams

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.060
Is in order to learn and grow?

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.700
You have to take on challenges

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.180
And you have to make mistakes. Absolutely

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:37.820
Um a lot of managers I've talked to when I when I say no, you need to let your team make mistakes

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.660
They look at me like oh my god, they're too afraid. My project's gonna fail blah blah blah too afraid

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.060
And you don't and but they don't understand that

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.820
The reason why you need to make let them make mistakes is so that you can help them learn from it

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.900
Yeah, I just wonder if you are the overbearing, you know 10 percent of your time

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.980
Dedicated to each employee if they have that room to grow and you sort of develop this

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:08.620
Dependency or codependency where as an employee i'm not sure what to do unless my manager comes by and gives me that

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:13.260
You know invest that hour a day and I didn't do the math. They're not that much but you know, um

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.980
Diving in and telling me, you know what I need to be doing. I need to figure things out on my own

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:24.060
One of the things with my current job Microsoft is I mentioned this a lot and someone asked yesterday

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:24.940
How do you figure out what to do?

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.100
I said there's always work to do and i've had a good track record of being able to figure out

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.020
What's the most important work to do? But I haven't had a manager tell me what to do in

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:39.550
Since I can remember it's been since like late 90s since I had a manager actually gave me assignments

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.100
That's I think that's

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.660
Positive I think so too. That's not a bad thing

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:52.780
I'm not saying negative things about my managers with with they trust me to figure out what needs to get done with one possible thing

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.180
Is like you only know what you what you are capable of knowing and I do think

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.220
Um, the only weakness to that is it would have been good

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.500
uh

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.140
At least annually a manager assigned you something

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.460
That's somewhat out of your

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:14.420
Comfort zone and not your wheelhouse or something that you would normally choose to do because that helps you grow

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.540
I know but as going back to my comment on

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.460
uh, michael arson's blog and and and my uh

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.800
Relation to that is that I do pick things that are hard. I do pick things out of my comfort zone

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.400
Alan is an active learner. So so yeah, I don't say yeah, I this is not a

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.560
A a path that's maybe automatic for everyone. Yeah

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.800
The the other thing uh, the last thing I think i'll say on this topic

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.120
I thought you were done already I was and then and then you said something that I liked

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.240
I don't know if you have figured out how this podcast thing works. We like talk and bounce the ideas off each other. Anyway

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.400
We'll work that out

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.720
Maybe maybe that can be an action for you to take. Hey brant. Take take this action

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.000
Alan yet again indicated that brint is number one

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.020
One thing I think these technical managers because you you you did say an insight

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.090
Around that they're afraid they're afraid to do this

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:20.690
And one of the things I think these these super technical managers need to get over or or hopefully it'll give them some some help

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.170
And hope to experiment

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.410
But the reason why you want to let you

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.610
uh

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.020
People make those mistakes

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:34.380
Actually, why do you think why would it be valuable to that technical manager to let those people make mistakes?

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.540
Valuable to him valuable to him. I don't know tell me

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.340
it's it's primarily because

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.290
Learning is what causes an acceleration

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:50.770
If you don't let them make those mistakes and you don't give them the the the ability to actionably grow

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:56.450
Then you're going to be dealing with a static world from exactly. Yeah, right

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:02.450
You don't have the ability to accelerate this forward progress. You don't have the ability to scale

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:08.690
And quite honestly for those managers growing your team and getting them to to do that ability to scale

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:17.010
Is important to your career growth. Yeah, I i'm a also a big believer in the learning organization and yeah singe's work there

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.710
Absolutely with the 100 and not enough that happens

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:25.790
uh, the last thing that reminded me of as we continue to babble around this is

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.390
uh

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.390
In holo in a holocracy

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.470
Where does the decision making happen?

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:37.550
It rotates it happens at where it needs to at the closest point to where it needs to happen

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.630
and I believe in that for a team too, I

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:45.470
Uh, I think a lot of managers have you shared your world of warcraft story on podcasts yet. I'm sure I have

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:52.860
So yeah in brief I believe a lot in the world of warcraft theory of project management where?

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.240
You form a group

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.240
You know to accomplish a specific task

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.520
You work on that task together share the rewards then you either disband or take on another task

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.040
Yeah, and and who's the leader in the the world of warcraft model it rotates right? It depends

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.280
I think that model is all about holocracy and you know, i've done this dungeon before i'll be the leader

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.040
great

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.040
I've rode this pony before. Um

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:26.610
So, where was I going? Oh so decision making in hawks and in a self-organizing team in general it happens where it needs to

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.970
Many managers I know and i'm going to tell a quick story here

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:34.850
Uh want to be the single point for that decisions for their team

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.020
Slows the team down a lot

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.260
Now think about what happens and as microsoft people going oh god

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.900
I have stories for you and I will tell you the same story you're probably thinking in your head. I worked on a product once

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.280
where

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.700
our vice president

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:57.220
Not my favorite vice president at microsoft, but you can't don't know what i'm talking about because they have like 150 of them

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.660
But you know, I I think I mentioned this to you right at apple

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.020
They have like a cto a cfo a couple vps and that's it

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:09.460
I'm trying to guess the vp and we have 150. So anyway, is this a vp? So anyway here? Yes

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.700
Okay, not the one I was thinking of

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.740
Anyway, I better not say the name because um, yeah, it'll be obvious to some

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:22.580
And if I say his name i'll just start going off on him and this will be my final podcast recorded on the microsoft campus

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.420
but anyway, but anyway, but anyway, he was

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:33.580
He wanted to be involved in every decision and talk about a technical manager. Here's where you can go too far to the extreme is

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:42.940
We would be in he would show up to uh, like a ship room meeting we're going over bugs and he would dive in and want to discuss

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.740
Everything down to which reg key we are going to modify to do

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.380
You to make this work

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:56.860
At some point as a manager you can be you can be I mean even if you i'm a technical manager of a team of eight people

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.390
uh, I

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:04.190
There's a point, you know, i'm I can see myself fairly technical beyond the line. That's like way

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.430
I know on the line like

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.870
You need to trust people to make decisions and get out of their way and at some point

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:15.810
There are bigger problems you need to worry about than minutia implement minutia of implementation

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.550
When I see managers at that level like the first thing

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.950
um

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.380
I go

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.340
This guy seems like he's being defensive like yeah

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.940
And and typically people who aren't being defensive

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.940
In this case, he wasn't defensive. I really think that he

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:39.700
In a way, he sort of validated himself. It's like yeah, I can i'm a vp

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.780
But I still dive in here and you know if I had to I would write this code

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.590
I will tell you a a

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:52.750
Different story the best vp I ever worked for and i'll even mention his name. It was bob muglia

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.070
He was highly technical

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:03.550
I I remember, uh very fondly a day he and I spent three hours

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:05.290
uh

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.290
Bullshitting, uh outside

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:12.910
Talking about uh his exchange server deployment that he did all by himself

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:17.150
At his home now why a vp needs his own exchange server deployment at home

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.390
Doesn't matter

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.870
He did he had his own domain and pop wasn't enough, but he um

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.280
He at that time was vp

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.560
uh of server and tools division

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.060
right, so

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.060
That was his

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.820
I would I would say what he was doing and the reason when he went through those actions

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.580
He was highly tech the most technical vp i've ever worked for

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.300
But in terms of the space that he owned

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:53.420
I would argue what he was doing and why he was doing it was more so around customer empathy and helping his business grow

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.780
Not I mean he never got in our business. That is

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:03.420
Completely different. Yeah, I mean that's passion for technology which is completely different from

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:11.230
Diving in way too deep on day to day implementation details. That's a great example of get the you know, get out of their way

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:17.170
I'm just i'm just imagining your your last vp going through like a code review and going hey

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.970
Hard-coded string that shouldn't be there

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.810
My last vp. No, he definitely wouldn't have done that

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:29.090
He was the one you were talking about. I don't know that's the last one. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's the last one the last one's actually

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:31.490
Um, I you know, I like him

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.960
He's not my vp anymore. I have a different vp

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.540
I can't keep track how many different vps have I worked for? Oh my god

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.380
I don't even want to count. Yeah. All right, even certain which you're talking about

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.140
I I don't think we have time to dive into our last topic. So I have to shelve it

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.020
We will and I think actually

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.580
There's going to be some more interesting things coming up over the next two weeks on that topic

00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:00.060
So let's shelve it and yeah, and there's so much to talk. There's so much going on

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.780
But it's been fun to be back

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.220
Yeah again. Happy new year

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:04.460
Yeah

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.860
And I apologize that we didn't actually talk about anything

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:12.140
But we did get a few nuggets in there about management and structures and holocracies and other cool words

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:19.500
I can put in the summary when I get this posted short shrifting short. I gotta look up shrifting that sh r i f t

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.520
ing. Yes

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.080
All right. And another word for you to look up is

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.720
G-o-f-f-o

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.360
Okay, we're we're gonna call that good i'm alan i'm brent and we'll see you next time see you guys
