00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:18.460
Hey, Brandt, put your phone down.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.180
Gonna ride me up a 125.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.420
Oh, God, no.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.700
Oh, crap.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.700
I can't read it well enough.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.220
I'm gonna have to edit the whole intro because Brandt is now...

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.060
Post my face wanted, dead or alive.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.700
Wow, this is bad.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.780
This is really, really bad.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.900
If you have bad hearing, you can't tell your tone to.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.820
Hey, everybody, I'm Alan.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.500
I'm Brandt.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.580
And we're here for episode 55 of A-B testing.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.580
55.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.300
Brandt's pretty happy about 55.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.390
So, anything exciting with you, Brandt?

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.350
That wasn't even like a leading setup question.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.950
I'm just trying to see what it'll say.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.140
No, I have a sad story about a personal failure.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.300
Oh, the things I could say right now.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.270
Is this a story for our listeners

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.270
or is this one you want me to rub your shoulders

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.390
while you lightly sob?

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.620
So, as you know, I went back to school

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.060
and I have two classes left.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.860
One on graduate level research writing,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.700
researching and writing,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.860
and then I have my capstone project.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.480
Okay.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.720
Unfortunately, in the last six months,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
I don't wanna mention it on the podcast,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.520
but you're aware at home,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.160
there's a bit of a family crisis.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.190
And that's taken a good bit of time.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.110
So, I took three days off last week.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.110
I had a big midterm proposal due last night

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.210
where I have to write up a research design proposal

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.390
for what I'll do in my capstone project.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.940
I tried to catch up, read everything.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.100
I wrote about 12 pages.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.620
And when I sat back about four hours before it was all due,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.180
I sat back and I read it with the eyes

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.660
like I do when my employees give me a proposal.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.860
And I looked at it and I said, this is crap.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.180
So, I withdrew from the class.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.140
I gotta start all over again in September.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.060
Summer.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.900
Yep.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.260
Now, were you also enrolled in the,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.760
or these classes overlap?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.560
Was that the purely the capstone class?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.720
Or that the research class?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.840
No, they don't know.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.040
By design, you should take them sequentially.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.600
Okay, I don't know if I've mentioned this

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.800
on the podcast before,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.480
but I think I mentioned this in a blog post

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.840
several years ago, but,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.200
and I mentioned it every time I go back

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800
and visit my alumni, my university,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.760
is the methods of research class I took,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.080
probably the most valuable class ever took in my life.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.360
Probably one of the ones that,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.800
it's the class that taught me how to learn

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.720
how to figure stuff out.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.080
Yeah, and that's actually what I concluded

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.560
when I looked at this.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.350
I was busily focusing on producing the paper.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.350
And I read about 20 different literature articles.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.870
So, I learned a lot about the topic I'm researching,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.040
but I realized when I sat back and analyzed it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.380
that I hadn't learned about structured research sufficiently.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.900
So, what I had produced was essentially

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.380
a stylized book report.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.220
And I said, so you don't go back to school

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.180
in your soon to be late 40s

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.380
because you give a crap about the degree

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.100
or give a crap about the grade.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.660
And I don't, and I'm very open and honest

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.160
with my professors on this.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.220
I'm here, I do it to learn.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.420
And so, when I realized that I hadn't really,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.220
to my bar, learned the topic that I was supposed to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.880
in this class on researching,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.440
I had learned enough of it to know that

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.160
it's an interesting thing to learn.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.700
There's a lot of black art that researchers go through

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.860
to find relevant articles.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.980
And...

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.740
Indeed, so I was, I'm old, even older than Brent,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.300
and I was in graduate school before really the internet.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.220
I mean, internet existed, but my,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.420
the only thing I had to research,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.900
I could pay long distance to dial up a bulletin board.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.180
There was no local bulletin boards

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.020
where I went to college when I was in grad school.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.180
Where did you go?

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.540
I was in, I was at Central Washington in 1993, 1992?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.620
And 1893 is when I got my master's.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.700
Central Washington.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.540
Yeah.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.380
You went there?

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.200
Mm-hmm.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.610
No, in Ellensburg.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.690
Okay.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.650
But what I learned there that I've transitioned

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.410
is things like, if you find a relevant article,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.690
you look at what it cites,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.410
and you figure out, and you start looking at

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.770
what other articles cite these same things,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.730
and what article, if you go read all these articles

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.890
and see what they cite,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.210
and really digging in those extra few levels

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.890
is where you find the nuggets

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.210
of really cool information in the insights,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.530
which leads to Stephen Johnson's thinking,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.290
gives you more ideas to put together

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.170
and merge together and come up with great ideas.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.170
I have been thinking about Stephen Johnson a great deal

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.890
because I concluded exactly the same thing.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.730
Yeah.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.420
And there is another quote that,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.660
any field of study that you want to master,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.660
that if you just read an hour a day on that topic

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.490
in seven years, you would be a worldwide expert.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.680
That's the quote.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.520
Given what I just went through

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.240
in the last few days on that,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.640
like I found lots of really great ideas

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.120
connecting the dots between entirely different topics.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.960
My research was on near real-time analytics.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.900
I wanted to target it for obvious reasons,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.300
for the cloud market,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.290
but there are a lot of other industries

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.210
that have that same near real-time analytics problem

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.610
and have similar problems.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.020
What I found very attractive

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.940
is analyzing the healthcare industry.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.560
So here at Microsoft,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.360
when we talk about up and down times,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.240
we refer to it as either the server health

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.960
or the VM health.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.720
If you do that sort of mapping

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.240
while reading any of these healthcare articles,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.760
you realize that, oh my God,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.240
you could just search and replace this thing

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.480
and looking for the word patient,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.280
put in the word VM,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.060
making some certain mappings,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.060
like the presence of a certain chemical

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.860
inside the bloodstream doesn't necessarily map well,

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.100
but heartbeats do.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.540
Yeah.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.060
We even call it a heartbeat sometimes.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.380
We do.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.260
So I read a book on, and I've totally forgotten the book.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.620
I liked the book so much

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.860
that I kept on reading through the appendix.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.800
I'm going somewhere with this, 15,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.420
more than 15 years ago.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.280
Anyway, one of the things that said at the end of the book

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.080
was, gosh, to the life of me,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.240
I've thought about this book a hundred times.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.880
I have no idea.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.440
I think it was some sort of leadership book.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.680
I don't know.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.960
But it said, you should challenge yourself

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.200
to learn new things and subscribe to,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.800
and some examples like, read blogs,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.020
and blogs are fairly new back then,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.760
but they go, subscribe to magazines.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.840
And I subscribed for about 10 years

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.960
to this magazine called Science News.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.960
And Science News was this little thin eight page,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.560
maybe 12 page, little thing that came every week

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.880
and eventually came every other week

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.320
in a little thicker format, not much.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.040
But it was just random,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.400
it was random little publications from the world of science.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.520
These aren't like IEEE type papers,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.000
but little, everything from a half page blurb

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.640
to a two to three page article.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.890
And some of it admittedly went over my head.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.440
Everything I could understand,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.360
I found fascinating and interesting,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.720
and there were always some little parallels,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.720
oh my gosh, this is just like something from leadership,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.840
from software, from testing, from craftsmanship,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.140
that I can map to my own world.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.680
And one of those examples is pre-Steven Johnson,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.280
how good ideas come from,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.020
but just one of those ways I was sucking in,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.360
I almost used the word alternate,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.040
but alternate, the word alternate now means

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.200
something different in the age of Kellyanne Conway.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.900
So, but these different,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.260
these different ideas that I could,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.200
just sort of merge into the things that I already knew,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.800
I found very valuable and very fascinating.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.240
Yeah, when you definitely go through the experience

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.020
and you're cognizant of this idea

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.500
that new ideas come from old ideas getting together,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.730
several times just in the last few days,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.690
I just said, oh, holy crap, it just happened.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.850
Just happened to my head.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.170
Literally 30 seconds ago.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.010
It's not being cognizant, being,

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.690
there's an openness to this, an openness like,

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.570
I need to look at all this input coming in

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.370
and at some middle level be able to go,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.990
are there new connections of ideas coming in

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.130
that I need to act on or think about more?

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.210
Oh, there's.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.650
There's definitely a thread spinning

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.690
in both of us all the time.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.890
One of our, and surely we're not the only people

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.250
who equate thinking to multi-threaded computing, right?

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.090
No.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.730
But there's always one like semi-active thread

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.010
in the background, kind of looking at what's coming in

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.350
and looking for those connections.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:42.350
So I chose, when you were trying to find this book title,

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.250
I chose perhaps unwisely to not interrupt you

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.690
and be snarky.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.210
But my daughter told me.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.770
Percy will call you out if you interrupt.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.130
Go on.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:06.040
Shout out to Percy.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.420
I think last Friday was Dr. Seuss's birthday?

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.500
Yeah, I think I remember something about that.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.580
What is your favorite Dr. Seuss book?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.660
You know, it depends on the mood.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.430
There's the canonical Green Eggs and Ham,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.870
which I read to my kids a few thousand times.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.030
Cat in the Hat.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.310
I like Green Eggs and Ham better.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.150
As do I.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.510
There's some good stuff going on there.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.090
There's a little bit of a cats in the cradle moment

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.930
if you read through like, oh, the places you'll go.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.210
Really more of a graduation kind of book you give somebody.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.810
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.130
Which is, I think, sort of a precursor or a prequel,

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.200
if you will, to Green Eggs and Ham.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.360
Yeah, I can buy that.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.280
So anyway, I would go, my favorites,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.440
depending on mood.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.840
I'm now trying to resist the urge

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.400
to spin the rest of the podcast,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.680
having an academic debate on which is the best Dr. Seuss.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.200
The Dr. Seuss guide to agile software testing.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.680
We were having a debate at our house.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.760
It was split into two camps, Go Dog Go

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.510
and Green Eggs and Ham.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.690
I took leadership on Green Eggs and Ham.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.210
I represented that point of view.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.090
For some reason, that Sam I Am line,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.450
really, it rings true to my soul.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.930
There's also the Grinch that sold Christmas.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.770
Again, that's-

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.090
But because that's seasonal?

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.090
Right, exactly.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.370
You can't have a seasonal be a favorite

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.050
because, do you pull that?

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.050
I think you can.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.490
I don't know.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.450
Well, I think you can,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.290
but it's just gotta be fantastic.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.290
Like Die Hard is now considered to be a holiday movie.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.690
Right?

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.650
And I'm just like, okay.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.490
Stretch.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.130
Stretch.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.050
All right, shall we do a podcast?

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.370
Oh, yeah.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.210
Okay.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.090
How about we start off with a word from our sponsor?

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:18.930
Okay.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.290
Once again, the folks at TechWell

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.640
are sponsoring this episode of A-B testing

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.720
and they have some training coming up.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.600
Training all the time through SQE.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.000
They are so nice to sponsor us

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.570
that I'm going to talk about them just a little bit.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.410
One would argue that's the definition of sponsor,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.250
I suppose.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.090
Perhaps.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.930
Yeah.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.900
Did you know that software testing isn't dead?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.140
I did know that.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.140
But it is definitely changing.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.300
The State of Software Testing Professions Survey

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.620
published last year by TechWell,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.060
participants overwhelmingly agreed.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.260
Now again, I'd hate to interrupt my own PSA,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.140
but if you're surveying a group of testers,

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.700
you have a little bit of confirmation bias

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.820
that we need to acknowledge.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.660
Selection bias.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.820
Selection bias, correct.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.940
Selection bias.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.460
Perhaps confirmation as well.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.140
All right, I'm gonna start.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.180
In the State of the Software Testing Professions Survey

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.940
published last year by TechWell,

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.140
participants overwhelmingly agreed

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.540
that as long as humans were responsible for software creation,

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.260
the role of the tester will be needed.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.460
That makes sense.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.300
But the same report-

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.580
Oh, wait, wait.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.340
But the same report also found

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.460
that today's testing QA professionals

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.220
are being called upon to have even more technical skills.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.260
So far, nothing I disagree with.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.940
There's little doubt that the role is evolving.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.900
Except for Brent's little interruption here,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.020
I'll let him get on with.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.450
No, no, no, go ahead.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.490
So as part of TechWell's convergence

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.290
of expert resources for software professionals,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.210
they provide premium software improvement training

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.250
and certification courses through SQE training for testers,

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.610
test engineers, QA specialists, and more.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.090
Whatever you wanna call yourself

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.170
if you're involved in software quality and testing,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.730
they got stuff that will help you out.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.250
SQE, if training software testing training weeks,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.330
offer up to 10 specialized courses

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.240
during one week in one location.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.840
This includes four Agile testing courses,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.040
including an improved

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.680
and expanded Agile test automation course,

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.000
new management planning and measurement courses

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.520
developed specifically for experienced test leads

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.000
and managers, as well as courses on security testing,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.800
mobile testing, and more.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.240
Upcoming testing training weeks are planned

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.040
for Boston, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.800
You've been to, I've never been to Chicago.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.520
I have never been to either of those.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.480
I've been to Boston, I love Boston.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.150
I've been to Boston in Fallout 4.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.870
I did spend a lot of time in Boston in Fallout 4 myself,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.710
which was weird,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.070
because I've actually walked some of those trails

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.030
in not screwed up land ever.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.880
But that I'm all distracted on Fallout 4,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.630
only one of the three plays games, I think.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.310
Anyway, if you've made it this far in our ad,

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:14.130
A B test listeners can save $250

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.850
on any testing training week course

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.850
purchased by March 31st

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.450
with promo code 17ABW,

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.050
which I'll put in the show notes.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.650
Again, that's 17ABW.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.370
And you can sign up at TechWell,

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.570
and I will put the link in the show notes as well,

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.650
but $250 if you're near one of those places.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.210
I know we have some East Coast listeners

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.410
probably get up to Boston for one of these courses.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.310
They're very well done and recommended.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.550
Star hasn't happened yet, right?

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.230
Star is always happening somewhere.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.510
I mean, there's a West and an East and a Canada.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.310
The next star is in May, April or May,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.550
I haven't looked in Orlando.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.930
There is a chance that you can still go register for Star.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.350
Also save a bit of cash with the A B testing promo code.

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:07.310
Sure, A B testing.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.790
That was from episode 52, I believe.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.110
We had that sponsorship.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.950
Yep.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.710
You can go check that out as well.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.270
But anyway, if you are in those areas,

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.350
want to get a week of training

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.590
for you or any of your employees,

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.110
you can use the code 17ABW

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:26.030
and get some money saved for you or your employer.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.070
Thank you, TechWell.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.630
Thank you, TechWell.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:34.110
Now, as a somewhat completely, totally aside.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.550
That's so rare that we do an aside

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.230
or any sort of thing off script in our well-prepared show.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:46.260
So you mentioned that the confirmation bias,

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.900
selection bias, overwhelmingly,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.960
as long as humans were involved,

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.360
testers will still be needed.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.920
So what spawned up in my head

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.920
was a discussion I had at work the other day.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.200
I was listening to the radio,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.920
I think it was some NPR show.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.260
And a guy mentioned something that hit me pretty hard

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.410
because I couldn't refute it.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.960
And he said, our children,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.880
so our grandchildren will never have a driver's license.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.500
And I'm like, yeah, that's probably true.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.340
But the way things are going,

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.740
the way trends are going,

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.740
there is a great deal of things that will be automated.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.650
To that effect, I'm wondering, you know what?

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.790
That world where humans aren't needed for testing

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.940
may not be all that far away.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.100
That reminds me, there's a lot of talk of,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.940
I mean, as long as there have been testers,

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.340
there's been talk of automation taking away testers' jobs.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.580
And it doesn't work that way.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.860
But I think testing, you really need this

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.700
quality professional.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.420
But this is a different kind of automation

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.300
than talking about.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.100
Yeah, but I saw a discussion just last week on Twitter.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.920
Oh, it's because Microsoft wrote,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.180
there's some research guys, I didn't look at it.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.280
So I'm sure there's flaws with it.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.440
Some auto programming AI.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.640
You describe what you wanted to program

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.420
and it programs it for you.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.860
I didn't even look any farther than that.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.400
Then there was a tangent discussion on automation for this

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.860
and self-testing software.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.010
And it made me think.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.050
And I haven't thought this through yet.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.890
I should blog about it,

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.690
but I'm gonna talk about it right now instead.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.530
Okay.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.350
It's easier.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.930
So we have talked before, Teal Shop,

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.200
about using logs for diagnostics.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.400
The logs should tell you what went wrong with the program.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.520
If you have really great logging and telemetry,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.400
you can tell the failures in the program.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.600
You're not gonna identify, just squash the stuff.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.880
You're not gonna identify like user experience errors

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.080
and if the screen flashes pink

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.420
or maybe you could catch that.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.200
But a lot of what's going on in the software,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.080
you can tell what's going wrong via logs.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.480
Now, we add either some self-execution

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.880
or some self-monkey test,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.740
a diagnostic program that basically executes every,

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.240
calls everything in the model layer automatically.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.100
The logs are generated

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.260
and you kind of have the edge of self-testing software.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.140
Yeah.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.540
And you throw in advances in AI techniques.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.060
Right, you use AI.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.620
You build an AI engine based on actual patterns

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.460
of customer data.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.760
And it's always modifying the way it self-tests itself.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.680
That's a heck of a regression suite.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.520
Yeah.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.560
I, actually that is relevant to a blog you did recently.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:04.300
I was trying to download a data science tool yesterday.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.620
And what this tool professes is that you pointed at any data

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.780
and it will find the interesting patterns in the data

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.240
and it will find the interesting family of functions

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.400
as well as their extrapolation for those patterns.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.330
And I could see how a tool could do that

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.550
because that non-trivially that's a portion of my day.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.990
You do it enough times just like everything else,

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.310
you realize this crap can be automated.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.150
Yeah.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.150
So I think testers or anyone who is afraid of automation

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.150
is really, really, really, really,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.540
really missing the point.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.940
I mean, these things excite me.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.900
I'm not afraid about them taking away my job

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.500
because someone still needs to figure out how they work,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500
how to take advantage of them,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.120
how to make sure the patterns are correct.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.500
There's all kinds of other knowledge work

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.100
that excites me to do.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.900
But I think that, I think embracing this automation

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.100
and looking at what it can do for us

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.380
and looking for ways to extend it and get more out of it

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.340
and let computers do more of the hard work for us

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.540
is something, it shouldn't be scary to anyone.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.060
I think anyone who's scared of it

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.500
has other job security issues they need to address.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.430
So knowledge work, I don't know if there's another realm,

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.510
but knowledge work is not something

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.510
that has successfully been well automated in the past.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:48.190
But there is a trend in the last 10 years

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.070
on knowledge management and knowledge automation.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:57.520
There's a lot of techniques, statistical machine learning,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.100
process-oriented techniques around capturing

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.820
the knowledge of individuals.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.380
And once, like I've known, I don't remember the name of it,

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.740
but Google has been, has a lot of data

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.540
and they've been doing inference engines

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.500
on top of that data.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.340
And about 10 years ago, they started doing work

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.050
on turning their inference engines

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.010
on the output of the inference engines,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.640
essentially finding new patterns in the data.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.120
There was a very famous example of this

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.520
with the target and the father and the,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.090
where target, right?

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.250
Look it up listeners.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.570
Yep.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.700
Where target's AI learned that this father's daughter

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.540
was pregnant before the father did, right?

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.870
Yeah, it's a new world.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.030
So let me give you another example.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.790
There was three or four years ago,

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.910
could have been longer, I'm old, I forget,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.910
but I was driving to work and Amazon was just coming out

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.830
with their automated item stickers

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.270
for a lot of their shipping.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.470
This is taking away jobs.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.230
This is automation taking away jobs from people.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.590
I thought, wow, this argument sounds familiar.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:33.590
So here was automation taking away boring work from people

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:37.310
and creating some interesting knowledge work

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.310
because now you have automation to go pick these things,

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.550
but there's still a lot of analysis on how do I optimize

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.790
how things are laid out in the warehouse

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.870
to make life easier for these pickers?

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.470
How do I make sure that, you know,

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.350
could I tweak things to make sure that they're picking

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.350
the right size boxes and all this stuff?

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.630
So there's plenty of work to do there.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.950
What the automation has done,

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:04.050
it takes away some of the boring part,

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:08.250
which is similar to what we've done in test automation.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.970
We haven't automated away our fun exploratory.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.330
Let me really dig in and figure what's going on here

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.170
type work.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.210
We've automated away the boring stuff.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.570
Well, and again, with current trends,

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:25.050
particularly with the onset of Agile,

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.010
here I'm thinking about combined engineering.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:32.010
Like non-trivially, we've automated away the role

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.330
because we found better processes,

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.090
better approaches, the world change.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:45.210
Like there is an approach you can now take

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.610
in the services world that you really couldn't take

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.450
in the on-prem product world, right?

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:57.630
And so, in my view, the need for this dedicated role

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.670
has definitely lessened, right?

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.550
Whether or not testing is dead is somewhat

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.660
a irrelevant question, but it's...

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.180
It's definitely evolving.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.380
If you don't want it to evolve,

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.540
don't want it to evolve,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.960
or don't feel like it's evolving,

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.640
you better buckle up and get along for the ride anyway,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.920
because it's changing.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.820
Oh yeah, I mean, well, if you're a listener of this show

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.740
and you feel that way, like how did that happen?

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.180
Again, we have selection bias,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.500
preaching to the choir, all that stuff.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.210
Hey, you know what we haven't learned in a while?

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.570
Lots of things.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.330
Well, there's one thing in particular I'm thinking of.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.170
Okay.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:42.990
You know what it is?

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.830
What is it?

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.290
Leading close.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.910
Mail back!

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:51.750
I was concerned.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.710
I'm like, you're not gonna kiss me on air again, are you?

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.400
Not again.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.090
That one time was enough.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.420
Yeah, well, all right.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.220
So, we have a mail back.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.060
We do.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:08.900
Exciting.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.740
Exciting.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:15.120
From one of the three.slack.com, our Slack team.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.430
Noriam, Kanoriam.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.810
Noriam asks.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.670
Felipe.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:22.510
Felipe.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.430
Question for Brent.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.750
Or for BS Data Science, which hasn't started up yet,

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.310
but question for Brent.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.510
Can you share any experience you've had

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.350
with overexperimenting instead of going

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.450
with your best foot forward following gut instinct

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.170
or extrapolating from a small

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.350
or a non-stat significant population?

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.230
In other words, not pushing a change

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.430
that will make the product better

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.430
because you need to provide evidence

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.390
of the benefits of the change,

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:52.180
even if it takes weeks to produce such evidence.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.900
Yes, I can.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.740
All right.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.580
All right.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.820
A successful mail bag question.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.260
It'd be great.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:02.140
We should do a mail bag and go, nope, no idea.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.580
All right, thanks everybody.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.640
All right, so that's the show.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:14.410
Wow, that was a long question with lots of really long words.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.850
It's like four lines.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.610
But it has words like extrapolating, which is good.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.850
Yeah, extrapolating is a great word.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.970
Okay, so let's take it.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.630
Actually, that word wasn't there,

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.470
but I just wanna throw that in there.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.760
Oh.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.760
So his question, what it reminds me of is

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.250
the old school, hey, we're about to ship.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.490
Test and dev are in a triage room.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:46.900
We're all arguing around the bug and no one has any data.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.010
Now he brings up overexperimentation.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.350
Not really certain what that concept is,

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.670
but it kind of reminds me of sort of

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.630
the intuitionist battles that occurred

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.250
for me back in those days.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.740
And a bit of are we overthinking

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.980
or overanalyzing the problem?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.780
And I would say, I kind of take a different approach

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.860
when I think about it in terms of a test context

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.020
than I did back in those days.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.380
Back in those days, it was,

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.920
so let's say we found a bug.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.620
Really what we're trying to judge

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.340
is what is the customer impact.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.100
Now I would say back in those days,

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.000
those were important discussions

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
because again, it was an on-prem product world

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:55.060
and it was a high time cost if we made the wrong judgment.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.230
But so what we did is we judged it

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.270
by perceived customer impact.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.390
Is it gonna be a 2% case

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.790
or is this gonna impact the 50% case?

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.710
Knowing what I know now,

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:15.630
if this was really important,

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:20.030
then we would have handed it off to usability

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.510
and said, hey, we'll do a fake A-B test.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.790
We're gonna give you two versions of the test.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.510
One with this, one without.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.720
And there'd just be MVP skins of the product

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.560
so that it's really cheap to produce.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.370
And then we just let the usability training

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.390
come to the opinion.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:50.130
The one problem though that he talks about,

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:53.450
the way I'm remembering it was essentially,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:57.550
hey, we're having a big debate.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.470
Being blocked by lack of evidence

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.870
and the time it's going to take to produce the evidence

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:11.870
is outside of our window in which we need to close down.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.970
For me, it comes down to how do you address two questions.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.510
So second half was, for example,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.550
not pushing a change that will make the product better

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.350
because you need to provide evidence

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.270
of the benefits of the change,

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.550
even if it takes weeks to produce such evidence.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.030
Okay, so not pushing a change

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.450
that will make the product better.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.300
Let's start with that one.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.240
How do you know?

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.090
And the question is, do you use gut for that

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.530
or do you wait for the data?

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.490
No, no, but better.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:53.610
As proactively to say that listeners of this podcast

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:59.050
know that the producers of the A-B testing podcast

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:07.570
firmly state product better is defined by the customer.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:13.790
So pushing a change that will make the product better

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.990
under that context implies that you have some data

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:24.610
or you're just taking a sort of like a

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.730
an ivory tower point of view intuitionist opinion.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:36.960
Now, so I guess the question comes down to

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.520
what's the risk of being right?

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.240
What's the risk of being wrong?

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.760
And what's the ROI in those two conditions?

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:52.590
If given that there's a timeline,

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.830
what I would say is if the ROI

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.730
of whatever's under discussion is potentially high enough

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.730
that there is reason to believe that this is a big deal,

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:12.780
then what you do is you spend your time finding evidence.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:19.970
You don't do it as a pure, you don't go down

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:24.130
and you don't try to do a full three month

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.590
data science project on this.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.990
You take the time that you have available

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.670
and you reduce as much uncertainty

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.910
on this question as you can.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.070
So let me.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.830
If this is a brand new product

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.650
that the world doesn't know about,

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.910
then you're gonna have to make a gut call.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.890
And your customers are people that you can't get

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.870
in contact with or you don't have any yet.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:49.710
It's tough.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.230
But this kind of goes back to,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.490
let me know if this makes sense to you.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.630
When Kemp Beck's first talking about Agile,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:59.070
he was implementing software for the people

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.270
that were sitting upstairs.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.110
He could actually involve the customers daily

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.350
and get them involved and go upstairs

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.710
and ask them about things.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.710
That's data and evidence that can help you

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.790
make decisions on what's better.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.590
Where data science and telemetry

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.790
and where data has come in is when those customers

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.630
aren't in the same building as us

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.590
or the same state, same time zone.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:21.590
So we collect that data remotely and we analyze it.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.070
So somewhere in between is if,

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.230
the exception is when you don't have any customers yet

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.510
or it's a secret project, hasn't been announced yet,

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.510
but otherwise you can contact,

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.390
maybe you have some early adopter customers.

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.990
This is easy in Xbox, very easy at Unity also.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.390
People want to get on the early,

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:40.740
people want to be early adopters.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.140
Depending on the product,

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.340
I think it's easy in all cases.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.640
Right, because if someone's a user of your product,

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.460
you're gonna have some faction of those,

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.140
some percentage of those who are,

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.300
yeah, you want me to try something new?

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.340
Let me know how to get some feedback.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.060
I'll do that, sure, no problem, I love you.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.020
Yeah, early adopters, they actually,

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.380
so there was a study on this,

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.340
and early adopters actually get something out of it.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.740
They're willing to take the risk

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.630
that the product is a little bit crappy

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.630
to gain the advantage of number one,

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.910
influencing the direction of the product,

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:19.310
as well as already be ramped up on the product

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.310
when it hits the shelves.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.110
But they don't even have to be an early adopter.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.390
One of the things I've talked about doing,

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.550
I've never done this before,

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.990
is setting up some sort of regular,

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.310
just call between, like with me,

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.870
a support person, and some or a few people

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:41.430
at some company, and talk about just ideas.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.950
And then go, what would you think if we did this?

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:43.790
Would that be worse?

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.670
They go, well, it may, I don't know,

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.310
it'd be indifferent, or, oh my god,

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.190
that'd be awesome, or don't do that, oh my god.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.800
You don't even have to implement the crummy feature,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.760
or the feature that you don't have to even

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.860
implement the A-B test.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.780
You can just, if you have a good rapport there,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.900
you can just ask them.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.740
And again, you have a little bit of sample size

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.620
issue with one person, but you get a half a dozen

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.660
of these going on, you could get that data

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.140
in other ways than waiting for the long pull

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.060
of data to come in.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.020
As long as you realize that if you're making

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.100
decisions off of intuition, then there's a risk

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.700
that you're making a decision off of bias.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.540
If you stay objective and realize that what you're

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.540
trying to do is remove the maximum amount of uncertainty

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.340
in the time that you have available,

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.660
then you go after that.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.100
There's multiple different approaches.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.220
So, as occurred to me, I'm speaking with my

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.940
data science hat on, but I think the Agile hat

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.740
is the one that makes the most sense here.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.460
It depends on the product, but on my team.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.770
My team fixes absolutely zero bugs for purely

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:08.000
future-proofing points of view.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.920
Like, if one of my reports found a bug

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.240
and another one of my reports issues

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.160
and it's code that we've shipped to production,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.920
or even if it's not, if, hey, you know what,

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.840
one of the things that we could do is we could

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.480
really solidify this widget and harden against

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.480
this particular concern if you make this three-day change.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.920
I'm 100% consistent on, no, we're not doing that.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.880
We don't spend, on my particular team,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.760
I'm already overloaded in my backlog on things

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.560
to produce where there is customer demand.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.200
I simply guide my team on these ones.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.200
Like, great, I love the passion, and yeah,

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.240
I can definitely see a place where you might be right.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:09.680
So, what I want you to do is the bare minimum

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.240
is on where this code is.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.080
I want it abstracted such that if we,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.470
once we learn that you're right or wrong,

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:23.230
I want us to be able to very quickly shift

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.800
to the correct position.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.830
In other words, so in Agile, there is this practice

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:34.470
that's known as, or principle, known as defer commitment.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:39.270
And what that means is you stall making decisions

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:42.140
to the very last responsible moment.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.780
You don't go all in on, oh, we had to do it this way

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.700
because I have been in this industry for 10 years,

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.020
and I know everything about this.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.700
Any time someone plays the experience card,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.980
my eyes roll back to my head.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.820
Yes.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.350
So, you wanna say something?

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.190
I do, I do.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.430
Earlier, I just had a little insight,

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.430
which may be all full of crap.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:10.110
Earlier you talked about perceived impact of an issue.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.870
And it made me think of something we use at Unity,

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.070
something I've used at Microsoft for, called user pain.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.150
Figure out a combination of how bad is it,

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.790
how many people does it affect, et cetera.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.510
You can use the same principle, maybe it's an inverse,

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.750
but the same principle, as a backlog grooming technique.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.990
If I do this item, how many customers does it make happy,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.790
and how happy do they get?

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.670
Well, this is why I brought up ROI.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.470
So, you can look at like, well, it makes,

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.710
well, nobody, but it may make them happier later.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.390
Okay, right down at the bottom.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.430
Or, you know what I mean?

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.790
You can look at it the other way, like, it forces you

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:50.390
to think about customer value and business value

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:51.830
as a backlog grooming technique.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.990
So, you just look at an item,

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.310
it's not making anybody happier,

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.430
or it's only making one person happier right now.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.430
Okay, something bound to be more important

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.510
to work on right now.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:05.190
Yeah, back in the day, I spent a non-trivial of my time

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.180
blocking chips.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.150
No, this is not ready.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.550
Producing a bunch of data, this is not ready.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.710
We cannot ship this against the scorecard.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:22.770
Today, I'm 180 degree,

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.250
no, this thing has to ship.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:31.050
Because we can't, in my view, we can't evaluate properly

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.770
the quality of the product, the usefulness of the product,

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.370
if this doesn't go out.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.970
I had this on Teams, and I worked on Teams.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.770
I had that argument with our VP,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.730
and my manager all the time, I said,

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.810
we gotta ship this from people, oh, it's not ready yet.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.650
Said, we're making stuff up, so we don't have an MVP.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.330
I said, are you kidding, we're self-hosting

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.530
on this thing for the last four months?

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.090
Said, well, it needs to have more features.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:59.130
Said, no, we need to get feedback from people.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.970
Which is opposite, like, here I am,

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:04.530
the test quality guy going, no, ship it, ship it, ship it.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.690
Well, yeah, no, it's absolutely, to me,

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.890
it's nonsensical.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.680
It's going back to the backlog.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:20.100
Like, the way I tell my team I want them to operate,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.940
number one, or at least this is how I'm going to operate,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.460
number one, I am concerned about business value first.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.890
Okay, not realized business value.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.050
This means providing business value,

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.130
not because I said so, or the perception of business value,

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.130
but having an objective point of view.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.810
And I don't care what KPI we measure it by,

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:47.230
as long as it's measured objectively.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.400
Second, I'm concerned about calendar time.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.520
Calendar time, once we've lost it,

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.040
there's no getting it back.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.100
There's no way of fixing the calendar time problem.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.540
And then third, engineering time.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.020
Those are limited resources.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.020
Yeah, I have some levers I can pull.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.940
I can, as an old manager of mine used to say,

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.940
I can order burritos and influence people working late.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.620
I could try to hire vendors.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.340
I could try to articulate a need

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.580
for additional head count on my team.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.940
There's some levers I can pull on that one.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.300
But at the end of the day,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.820
even with maximum efficiency,

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.020
the amount of productivity on my team

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.780
has a top, has a limit,

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:45.120
which is underneath what's being asked of me to deliver.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.560
So we need a mechanism by which we tie

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.930
my team's capacity and produce the maximum

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.530
amount of business value.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.850
So this ROI discussion around bugs,

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:00.530
which I'm not certain if that's really

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.610
what Felipe was talking about,

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.750
but that's just what it reminded me of,

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:11.680
is kind of important,

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.360
and it's important to try to articulate it

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.440
from a non-intuition point of view.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.880
You don't have to overanalyze, right?

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.080
And matter of fact, you don't have the opportunity

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.200
to overanalyze, because if you agree with what I just said,

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.200
calendar time and shipping

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.200
are really important considerations.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:39.190
What I would focus on is, again, high order bit,

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.230
what's the number one, the cheapest way

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:49.690
if you were to assign this to somebody

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.650
and only said, look, I'm only giving you

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.960
four hours to do this research,

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.520
but we're gonna spend a half hour brainstorming

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.320
on how we could spend that four hours

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.240
to maximize the reduction of uncertainty.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.300
Then I would focus my attention,

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.240
how do we prove if we right or wrong

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.810
once this thing goes out in the field,

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:16.840
and how can we, if our decision we're making today is wrong,

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.060
how can we make sure that the product

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:25.510
will allow us to switch in near real time?

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:28.990
Look up, flighting.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:32.690
Yeah, if you have to go by gut,

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.520
have a way to reverse that decision if you're wrong.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.520
Right, and quickly.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.280
And if you have to go by gut

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.580
and you can't reverse that decision if you're wrong,

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.260
I would argue that you've got problems in your process

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.920
that you need to solve before trying to solve this one.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.800
Yep, agree completely.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.640
Anything else, Brent?

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.460
Nope.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.240
All right, this has been episode 55.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.180
55.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.320
55, A-B testing.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.160
I'm Alan.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:01.980
I'm Brent.

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.820
See you next time.
