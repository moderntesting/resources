WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
and Brant has left the building. No, I am looking at my bookshelf and unfortunately I think that

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.960
one is at home. Yeah, anyway, Jim. So Alan. We're awful. We are so bad.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.260
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brant,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.780
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:37.980
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hey everybody. Howdy. Guess who? It's us. It's us.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.700
Yeah. I'm Ted Cruz and I'm here to ask asinine dumb questions all day. That's what I'm good at.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.660
No, I'm Alan. I'm Alan. I actually try to ask interesting questions that people care about,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.780
but whatever, you know, you do you. How are you doing, Brant? It takes all kinds. I am surviving.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.100
What does that mean, man? Oh, we are reorging. What is that? Is this a big reorg? You don't have

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.860
to go into details because it's Microsoft and it might affect the stock price. It's like the moon's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.620
gravity affecting the tides. No. So are you in the windows org now? No. Just checking. So the,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.860
there's a couple of things that I would talk about if it weren't for the fact that you can't

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:35.660
that we have actually three listeners. Yeah. The definitely would be either a C it would be a CLM

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:46.460
or an NDA violation to talk about it too deeply. But I will and most likely a CLM for those not

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.020
up to speed on the acronym, a career limiting move. Don't think it would be outside of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:04.700
NDA though. But one of the issues that's happening, having right now is reorg was fundamentally based

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:15.700
off of something that was overbranded and to a degree where, at least in my view,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:26.700
it's near vaporware. However, it's been branded so successfully that senior executives have asked

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.700
for it, want it. And they've executed a reorg where essentially 25% of my management team

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:42.320
or my manager's team is moving out. And as a result, the rest of us here had to figure out

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:51.600
how to continue to operate the business down 25%. So that's the different kind of reorg where your

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:01.200
org is some of your org has disappeared. So your charter has not. Right. Nor expectations. Oh,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.400
and of course there are no Rex or headcount coming. Yeah. Yeah, that's fun. So I hear that too.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.230
I think I can safely say it's not, probably not uncommon to hear statements like, okay,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.390
you need to also do A, B and C and also we need to reduce your headcount spend.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.910
You just go great. Well, this is a fun game. We'll figure out how to play this.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.950
Yeah. I've had a manager, Brent, you need to let go of the tyranny of or

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.270
someone, someone watched too many Ted talks.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:47.760
Yeah. I was just like, uh, okay. When you're ready to get off of whatever cloud of bullshit,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.000
you're on it and actually get down to, to working with me to help solve this actual problem. Let me

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.680
know. Right. Otherwise I'm just gonna, I'm going to go have a meet with my team and struggle through

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.360
it. Yeah. Fun, fun, fun, fun stuff. How about you? Anything new?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.360
You know, the work stuff I'm on the other end. I'm trying to figure out how to, not trying to

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.440
figure out it's a lot, it's a long path, a little bit of wackable and you have a large org

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.320
where it's been brought together from multiple orgs. It's a constant exercise in creating

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.920
alignment and clarity across the org. So everybody stays kind of going in the same

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.150
direction, but it's fun. It's a, you know, it's largely there. It's just pop up here,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.600
just that pop up there, address that we're playing a fun game of what's the game called

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.320
where the goalposts keep moving? That's just, is there, is there, is there a metaphor there?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.560
I don't know what it is. The fighting game where the goal, fun game, fun.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.360
I'm not familiar. I got to think of a name for that. Like, uh, oh, it's like you ever

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.320
played flux, the card game. Yes. Where the rules change as you play that, that, uh, yeah.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.800
So there you go. I want to write a version of that for managing a large software org

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.930
where the rules around budget keep on changing. And the goal is to hit your budget, even though

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.000
you don't know what it is until you've actually hit it because the rules keep changing. I think I

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.240
could say that isn't that Conbom. I don't know if you're joking or if that's your segue.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.800
It's actually, I am not joking and it is handy as a segue.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.990
So how is Conbom the same?

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:39.630
So Conbom, right? It enables, it enables flow. It enables you to have the ability to

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:50.030
start work based off of the best available knowledge and do so in a, in a, in a batch

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:58.430
model, like Conbom optum in terms of dealing with, um, dealing with the goalposts changes.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.230
Changing Conbom is the perfect, uh, software model for that.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.320
All right. Well, let's let's.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.240
Great. Waterfalls the worst, right?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.640
Yeah. Yeah. There's more complexity to it, but I better, I better, uh, cover myself as well.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.760
But it's a fun game. The things we do as leaders, I think someday I'll talk about my model for

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.160
creating clarity and alignment, but, uh, maybe we'll do it today. Maybe not. Let's talk about

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.980
Conbom. What is Conbom? No, that's not it. So somebody in one of the three dot slack.com are

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.780
slack group, which you can get a free invitation to by going to modern testing.org. Uh, we don't

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.420
charge for it. You can just come join in, hang out, ask questions. Uh, people are very helpful

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:50.140
there. Someone, I think Percy, I could be wrong pointed out this website called con bond board

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:59.010
game.com. This is actually based on a simulation that I've done before many years ago, where you

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:08.960
play a game where you are assigning people to do tasks on a con bond board over many, many weeks

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.640
in order to try and generate the most revenue for your company. And little,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.320
little things come up as you play. So Brent and I have both played this. Uh, we're going to talk

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.950
about a little bit about how we approached the game, but it might be fun before we go into it.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.910
I don't know if Brent, if you want to do around right here alive in 10 minutes, or if we should

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.390
just talk about our strategy. Uh, but we played, uh, just the simulation on con bond board game.com.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.430
Go ahead and bring it up. We'll wait. Pause your podcast and Brent doesn't know how much money he

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.150
made. I didn't make the leaderboard. I did. All right. I made $40,000, $40,000 fake dollars.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.190
I don't get any money in our account for this, but it was fun. So all that intro side,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:56.510
what do you want to do, Brent? Uh, why don't we do both? Why don't we start it up and, and, and

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:06.030
act like we are an executive committee firmly command and controlling the con bond board.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.670
All right. I don't know if I like that or not, but, uh, let's, let's get into it. So I'm going to,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.510
there's a little announcement on the simulation. What did I do wrong? I said,

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:21.300
start a new game. You got to click one of those. I got to click standard game, standard game. All

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.700
right. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Directions who, who reads the directions? Come on. So we have here,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.820
just if you're playing along, we're on day nine of a project. There's a bunch of stuff in progress.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:40.580
The board is full. Uh, we have three testers, two developers, two product managers, and we are

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.220
trying to get stuff out in order to make money. We haven't made any money yet. Have a brand.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.180
Nope. None. All right. How should we make money? I'll talk about what we're doing here. Right now,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:56.420
we have, uh, everybody has the same board start off with, we have three stories and test, uh, two

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.500
in that are ready for tests, but we can't get into the board because you reached whip.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.380
Dev is at whip as far as work getting done. Kind of everybody's at whip.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.980
Everybody's at, everybody's at limit. So the, where, where our pipeline is full of stuff

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.300
and the name of the game and combine is flow. So what did we do first, Brent?

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:23.140
Well, so in for everyone in the game, um, not playing along Alan and I are doing an experiment.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.060
Uh, obviously this is not a video cast, but so in this particular game,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.700
right? We have to get things to done. Right? So the, so the first thing I'm going to call out

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:41.010
the thing I adore about Kanban and, and I think it was, I think I picked this up

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.090
from Alan through who was the guy that did personal Kanban. I know you get the memory.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:54.290
Oh God. Um, I do. I do. It's on my bookshelf. My headphones, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim is right. Jim

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.610
and brand has left the building. No, I am looking at my bookshelf. And unfortunately I think that

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:08.130
one is at home. Yeah. Anyway, Jim, so we're awful. We talk so bad.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:19.100
You know, I can go to Amazon personal because I remember the book. Personal Kanban, Jim Benson.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.020
Benson. Thank you for, uh, this is why we only have three listeners.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:31.900
Okay. It's because he reason it's a key, key reason. Now let's see if I can remember why I brought that

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:38.900
up in the first place. Oh, I doubt it. Yeah. So Kanban, I believe I'm attributing this to him.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:45.300
It's either him or Al. Okay. The main difference between Kanban and scrum is that in Kanban,

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:53.170
it's all about what you finish. Finishing is what's important. Not starting. Right? So Kanban,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.730
you pull. So regardless of what you're using for project management, I tell my team all the time,

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:08.670
focus on finishing, not on doing. Get stuff done. The neat thing about Kanban is you focus on finish

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:15.390
and then you operate pull right as you have capacity. When you finish, you pull the next

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:22.430
capacity and you pull and pull. So it's like a vacuum that continuously flows. All right. So right

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:30.430
now we actually have bottlenecks in every column. We look at this and we see that we're at WIP in

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:37.470
test Devin and analysis. I'm going to just call that PM from here right now. Yeah, a couple call

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:44.190
PM. We're, we are, we have a bottleneck in every column, uh, but it's absolutely clear that we

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:50.910
need to bottleneck or de-bottleneck, uh, test. Right. Cause nothing else can, nothing else can

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:58.190
move forward until that test column is complete. Right now I see that you have allocated two heads.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.470
I'm just moving stuff around. Will you talk? Oh, okay. There's a couple of things you can do

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:08.670
there. You could, I could, I could add people who aren't testers. Those column to add it. It's a,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:14.830
if you're not looking at the game, it's a little, uh, the game is that if the person is doing the

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.750
tasks they're assigned to do, they're going to be twice or their specialty. They're going to be

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:27.040
twice as productive, but it is a random number of boxes of work, unnecessary boxes. They get done.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.760
So doubling up or adding more folks to it. If you really need to get the column clear

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:39.500
isn't a horrible idea. Yeah. Uh, but we don't need to get the column clear. We only need to create

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:49.390
capacity. And so my decision when I'm doing, when I was playing this is I was, uh, focusing on where

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:57.700
is the ROI. Okay. So, uh, Alan, we have three tickets. Alan has currently added,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:06.960
how do we play along this? So when I am looking at this one, no, no, that's absolutely wrong.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:13.120
Absolutely right. Keep talking, Brett. Yeah. Talking. No, don't look at what I'm doing.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.240
Yeah. That might make for a better podcast. Of course. So number one, we got to finish.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.040
You can't move them into the right. Yeah. I know. I know. I'm just, I'm just trying to distract you.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.000
It's working very, very well. Okay. So in the test column, we're going to just put,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.240
I agree with you. Just put one tester on each of them. The only thing I would think of is maybe

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:42.240
put two. So I don't know if putting two on what's on the S two ticket is going to get that done

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:50.460
sooner. Like I, I don't really care. So that what you have there is fine by me in terms of the

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:57.730
developer stories. So the green ticket, what's the benefit of the green tickets? Oh, those are,

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:06.900
um, I think it's a, it's an intangible. It's an intangible, but I think those speed us up.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.710
I think so too. They give us some bonus. I forget how it works because I didn't read the,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:18.750
I didn't read the instructions. Okay. So let I, those tickets are done. I would put the developer

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.630
instead of on the one 20 ticket, cause that takes too much time. I would put it on the

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:32.420
intangible. All right. And then we have a PM left. Sure. All right. You ready? Yeah. This is,

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.700
we're not going to do this for every round. People will be bored and quit. So we have,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:42.260
we have assigned some people to some tasks and we got some work done. We got two items to complete.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:47.620
Maybe we get three, we got two items to complete and stuff moves around on the board magically. And,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:54.820
and we moved stuff over. So we've completed the first day. They throw in some cool stuff on stuff

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.500
has to be done by a certain day, or if it's done by a certain day, if you choose to do it,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.340
you can get some extra stuff. Like right now we have one on our backlog. It's

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:07.460
has to get done by day 25. We don't need to start it yet. It has to get them in five days.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:15.170
Oh, I forgot. We started on day 10. No, this one doesn't. It's day 10. The one in ready is

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.410
due on date 15. Oh, I didn't see that one. Well, we should pull that one in.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:25.170
It's doing three days till we, till we do the game. Let's pull that one over. Okay. We're not

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.650
going to do the whole thing here. We're going to pull some stuff around on the board.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.450
It's a fun little game of combine. We'll get that one up there. Blah, blah, blah.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:39.170
What do you think here? Would you double up on the big task or just look like I work on his own?

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.290
I would let him work it on his own, but I'm not certain. Is that when we've already started?

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:52.940
When you say that one S S five. All right. We have not started testing it and we just pulled it over.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.660
All right. I would put it back to the dev backlog and I would take I one instead.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.910
So I'm doing the architectural improvement. Gotcha. Because that's going to speed us up.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:12.700
And now that's what we're going to do. Fair enough. So anyway, it's the goal is to get stuff

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.820
through and we're doing it very quickly here. And I realized that it's kind of boring,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.820
but I encourage you to try the game and go through it. It is not just Kanban,

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.380
but a little bit of systems thinking you have to look at what's on the whole board

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.020
and optimize for optimized for getting stuff done.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:41.580
I think it's, I found it to be very well done on teaching the concepts. Like for me,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:48.640
the thing that's a little awkward is the additional thing of, right. In my organization,

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.480
I don't have PM Dev test. Right, right. They're going off a specialist, which is it's fine.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:02.670
So having gone through the live version of this before, it's interesting. Like both you and I,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:07.550
we recognize right away that all the columns are full and nothing's going to move till test is

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:14.750
full till test is done. Right. So a lot of people didn't, in new to Kanban did not recognize that

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:22.610
right away. They didn't realize the importance of getting stuff done. So my advice, if you're going

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:30.050
through this game is focus not on working, not on doing focus on finishing and you will do quite

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:39.730
well. Well, yeah. And then in real life, in real life, the, the, so I, back in the day, I

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:47.060
walked people through conversion to Kanban, right. And once they get things moving, right. And they,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:53.010
they then start to argue on the whip. Mm hmm. Right. And there's a point in this game,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:59.250
if I recall when whip goes away and you can screw with it, I never did. No, yes. No, no, no.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.410
They do. Well, there's a couple of things that's great about the game. Like suddenly all your test

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:11.940
team dies or, you know, gets like exactly it, but yeah, whatever. They suddenly all get sick.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:20.690
You're like, well, wait a minute. Test is my bottleneck and all of my test team are sick

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:26.450
and out of office. What do I do? What do I do? Well, of course, everyone that's a listener of

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:36.240
this podcast knows what to do. It's well, put somebody else on it. Yeah. And that's what I love

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.360
to see in the end. And I didn't look at the other version of this game. Actually, it works the same.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.720
I know how it works. I would love to see a version of this where maybe it wouldn't be as fun with

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:54.020
the little gotchas that come up, but something, a version that was considered generalizing specialists

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.460
and maybe it's not worth, maybe it's not worth the effort. I think there's enough learning in

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.140
here. And especially I would recommend if you're getting used to Kanban and you want to get some

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.820
value out of it is play the game a couple of times, try experiments, because it doesn't hurt anything.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:13.820
If you make a bad choice and you, and you get a poor score and the score means nothing, but it

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:21.500
means that you're getting ideas on how to optimize flow, given a bunch of different information.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:31.340
Yeah. Yeah. No, I think the game very well simulates the majority of my experience

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:39.170
ever since shifting to Kanban. I don't get actual paid money. I don't actually have a PM and

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:50.130
test team generally, but everything else is straight up. Like my currency, but you can

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.890
change your currency to other things. I'm a data scientist. I produce a lot of things that

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:03.010
use and consume data. If I build a report, you bet I'm instrumenting it so I can see who cares.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:09.090
Who's like the point of data science that I think I've shared on this before, but the data

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:15.700
sciences job is essentially to automate decision-making. If no one's using decisions it can

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:22.340
make, what's the point of it? Not at all. None zero is of course the answer. So I want to pay

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:30.580
attention to that because I'm like, oh, well, I can de-invest in that one and go pick up one

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:36.100
of these other things that I've been deferring because the PMs had told me this was important.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.740
Well, now I know the truth. It's not. A short story is go check out Kanban Board Game.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.900
Worth giving a shot. It's fun to talk about. And it's a good, I think we both agree,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.860
it's a good simulation. It sort of matches the real world. Remember the days when we actually

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:56.420
had a little outline and stuff we'd put on the whiteboard and we'd use that to have a

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.750
more structured discussion instead of just completely winging it? Remember those days?

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.870
Yes, I do.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:02.430
Those were weird.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.750
I do.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.630
I have a question for you from our Slack channel.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.070
And I'm curious because I talked about this many years ago. Well, even before we talked about

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:16.350
modern testing, I think I first read this in McConnell's book and he referenced it somewhere

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.750
else, but it was the, and this is actually from what's his face. I think this may even

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:26.110
be from Capers Jones, but I could be wrong. The concept that gets repeated a lot, which

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:31.620
is the earlier you catch a bug, the cheaper it will be to fix. I have a reaction on that.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.820
I'm curious what yours is.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.860
The earlier you catch a bug, the cheaper it will be to fix.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.800
I generally agree with that.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.160
I think it's a myth.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.760
I don't.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:53.630
So I think the reason I think it's a myth is two reasons. I think it depends on the bug.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.350
Some bugs are very easy to fix at any time in the whenever you find them.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:21:59.730
Right.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:05.650
I understand the premise of it. The idea is that there takes time to get really familiar with the

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:11.730
code, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I would argue that for huge classes of bugs,

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:18.050
they're just as easy to fix at any time, whether it's the day I introduced it or

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.250
five years after someone else introduced it.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.550
When I see it referred to, it's an absolute, but it's, it's a half truth. It's a myth.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.170
No, I don't.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:32.900
I don't.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.300
I don't agree with that.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:35.860
Tell me why.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:42.770
So I'm going to go the other way. Right. When, when I first started, since we talked about

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:51.580
Kanban and when I first started doing Kanban and deploying the production systems using it,

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:57.820
one of the things that I realized is by continuously flow, right.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.340
And I've, I've talked about it on the podcast a couple of times or at times where

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.220
my team would deploy something and everything would be down.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:15.700
It would be down. However, because we caught it quick, we knew exactly what we needed to revert.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:22.620
And, and because we were going in small batches, we knew exactly where to look.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:30.140
And because we had just checked in yesterday, we didn't have to spend time reverse engineering.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.900
And that is the huge advantage of small changes.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:43.840
It's, it's the hugest advantage of small changes. It's, it's a huge advantage of catching things

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.200
quickly as well with those small changes. So there are, there are other aspects.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.560
For example, there are, there are pieces in my team today.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.080
Not today. Yesterday, we had what we called a swarm ticket and it's a rare event,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:08.480
something where we have, we had as of yesterday, technical debt in monitoring.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.680
Something went really bad that we were able to detect it yesterday,

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.160
but it's in a code that no one knows. And so someone has to go down now

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:25.120
because the person who wrote the code left the team. So someone now has to go down

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.880
and find the bug and fix it.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.520
There's, there's two things in play there. And again, it's not an absolute. I do not,

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:41.200
all bugs are not created equal. And in the case where you have a systemic issue that the owner

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.000
isn't there in complex code, of course it's more expensive to fix later when you don't have the

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.600
person with the expertise to know it was in their head when they wrote it there.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.760
I absolutely believe it. And I, well, I'll actually refer to 11 years ago,

00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:01.040
11 years ago, 11 years ago, I wrote a paper and gave a presentation at P and SQC on

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.640
called an introduction to customer focused test design. That sounds so non-modern test.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.680
Maybe I don't know. Anyway, gave a paper introduction to customer focused test design,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.280
talking about how we can focus test design on customer scenarios versus a bunch of damn

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.000
functional testing. Because even at the time I was writing developers should do that functional

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.240
testing when they're writing their code. But the idea is that the cost of change for a design or an

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.960
architecture issue or something that is fundamentally broken does go up over time because you, that,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.480
that knowledge of what you need to fix it can escape very quickly. You have to get the whole

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.590
system back into your head in order to fix it. But for a functional bug where you just wrote maybe

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:54.270
a bad unit test or didn't write a unit test for one thing, the cost of change curve for those

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.750
is basically flat. It may go up a little bit, but it's not that traditional curve.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:07.420
The cost of finding the bug or the cost of fixing the bug, like the actual amount

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:17.630
of code to change depends on number one, the loading slash the learning costs, right?

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:24.670
And the actual, the cost of the implementation. Like if you had, if you had an architectural error,

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:32.930
in some regards, when people, so the first time I heard this, like the cost of a bug increases as

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:40.210
it goes down, right? It was the old waterfall days, right? But they inappropriately associated

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:47.340
it with a timeline, right? If you're doing big design upfront and you have this, this quote unquote

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:55.900
beautiful architecture, and it's going to take you nine months to even do the first test.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:04.240
And in that first test, you find that there's a bug, right? It doesn't have to, yeah, the cost of

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.600
the bug is expensive because it's not because of time. It's because you, you took, you waited

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:18.480
nine months to do your first test. You didn't fail fast. It's a problem with big design upfront,

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:25.280
not to your point, that part, I agree. Which Kent Beck book was it? I think it was

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:30.480
extreme programming book. He also argued, and I think I didn't find this till afterwards.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.320
It came out before my presentation. Yeah. Because XP has been around since 2002 or so.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.640
I remember in the XP book when I finally read it, he also wrote a fairly flat cost of change

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:49.280
curve just due to iteration and feedback loops. But I guess it depends on what we call cost,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.760
right? The cost of actually changing the code is going to be the same no matter what.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.600
It's the additional costs, right? How much does the cost to ramp up?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:06.240
Again, I think we're largely in agreement, maybe not on semantics, because yes,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.240
if the cost is the same, yeah, then the cost of change curve is flat.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:17.040
So it's two things go into additional cost. One is any additional time needed for

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:26.000
the developer to regain context or to add new work around it as needed. If there's dependencies,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.960
for example, there's cost in there that could grow. But really, it's the cost of also impact

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.320
on the customer. And it used to be in the old days, there was a cost incurred needing to patch

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.880
the customer and get them to download a new bin and sending the bits out sometimes by mail

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.600
to go back to the early 90s. Right. But we just update stuff all with

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.760
tight feedback groups. We update stuff all the time.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.440
The cost is going to be dependent on how good your design is in the first place and

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:08.400
how well the bug is strung through to dependencies. If I have an interface bug and I go, oh, crap,

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.800
I'm going to have to change my interface and I have 50,000 different other systems depending on it

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.640
on the interface contract. Yeah, that bug's going to be expensive.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:32.000
Right. But it's because the design was bad up front and I did something wrong early on. It has

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.960
nothing to do with how long it took. I'm basically moving over to the only place,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.800
I'm more on your side than I was on my side in the beginning of this,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:55.440
Alan. The only additional cost of delay is, okay, do you have to redo things like the person has

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:03.200
left a team. So now you need to have somebody start up again. It's the knowledge cost I'll call it.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:11.700
Cool. Cool, man. Hey, I saw on Twitter, I got mentioned in a tweet because Speckflow,

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:17.860
which is Speckflow still around. Is that still the, maybe someone bought it. It's still around.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:23.700
Anyway, Speckflow from speckflow.org, they tweeted the book of the week is how we test software at

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:30.160
Microsoft. And they tagged me and they tagged BJ who hasn't been on Twitter in like 10 years.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.160
Oh my God. I'm not even sure. I did hear from BJ a couple of years ago. I think he's alive

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.400
and I still remember I don't have on my bookshelf, but I should go grab it. There's,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.280
hold on. I got to read you my favorite line from how we test software at Microsoft.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.480
Yeah. Why did they tweet that? All right. Well, I pull it up. I don't know if I ever told you this.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:56.240
So, uh, it was Ken Johnston that came to me and said, Hey, you're doing a lot of stuff,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.720
collecting information. You should write a book on how we test software at Microsoft.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:05.650
And I said, and Ken was my boss and I was enjoying excellence. And I said, okay,

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:10.370
I can do that. I think I have an idea. What's in my head. Cause I had a pretty good,

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:15.170
I had talked to a lot of teams and a good idea in my head. And I said, Ken, can I take, well,

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.690
I do this as part of my job. He said, yeah, we'll give you time to do it.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:25.550
So when you fill out a form for MS press to propose a book, what you do is say,

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.870
do you want to get, are you going to work on this on your own time and get paid for it

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.350
or on company time and not get any commissions? And I said, well, my boss has given me time.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:39.150
It's my job. I'm just going to write the book. And then Ken went and got a new job.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:45.470
And my new boss said, screw that. I don't need to do it on your own time. So absolutely zero,

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:52.960
zero proceeds, uh, from how we test software at Microsoft went to BJ and Ken and I, uh,

00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:01.200
and of course the book is dated and, and MS press were fair to work with. But anyway,

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.840
it was an experience. I think it's chapter six. I have to read.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:15.740
Oh my God. I'm rereading. I found the, the tweet. There's no replies on it.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:23.100
No, I liked it. No, I now I can't find it. Yeah. The book shares best practices,

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:30.860
tools and systems used by the companies testers used is, is very appropriate here. So

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:37.420
talks about the systems that were used back when we had testers.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:44.460
You know, when I go through this book, it's not quite as horrible as I sometimes give it

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:52.190
non-credit for. I think it definitely comes out like it definitely comes out as written by three

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:56.670
different people. Like I wrote, I like to say I wrote, I counted the pages once, but I wrote,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:02.990
I wrote most of it. BJ wrote two chapters and Ken wrote two chapters. BJ's chapters are all around

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:10.480
like textbook functional testing and which we taught at the time to our testers. But in

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.640
hindsight, I don't know if I would have done that. If I could go back in time.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:23.440
No, no. So I, I, I had the, uh, the, the test, uh, the book as well. Matter of fact,

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.840
I had to find that cause I have a section someplace where I keep all of my signed books

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.400
and your book is in there. All right. Well, I can't find the story, but it's, it's, but I do

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.480
think writing is I just, I'll show you this before I forget is he has this like run on compound

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.600
sentence full of long words and, and it's really like what? And the next sentence is,

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.800
while that seems very simple, blah, blah, blah. And I, I made fun of him. I said,

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:58.640
how did this get by editing? How did this get by our peer reviews? I don't know what happened,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:06.740
but that's yeah. So anyway, I'm not sure. I'm not sure who manages the spec flow account.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:13.060
I feel like it's an automated tweet set up like 10 years ago to, to, to talk about the book.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.620
I do think it's an excellent, excellent historical book.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.500
It is. It's a snapshot. And if you have the book, check out that picture of me on the back

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:28.340
cover. It is not the, not the picture you see today with the Alan who's growing a beard instead

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:38.430
of sourdough for, for a lot of people, a lot of people for the pandemic being stuck at home. They,

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:45.090
they made sourdough bread. I grew a beard. Yeah. Do you have the ponytail yet?

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.090
I could, if I wanted. So you're actually still cutting your hair.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.370
No, my hair's long. I know. I mean, my hair is long enough. I could put it in a ponytail.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.250
I don't usually do it. Let's need to keep my hair out of my face.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:00.290
Okay. So I'm, I'm going now that my hair and beard are so long,

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:08.930
I'm actually going to travel again for work. I'm going to Montreal in May for a little teeny

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:14.980
offsite with our leadership team. Yeah. So, and I'm actually, you know, I'm not quite ready for

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.630
this. I'm getting used to seeing the world, to seeing people. I went into the office,

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:26.380
mentioned last podcast. I went into the office for a while. I need to go to Copenhagen sometime too.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.660
So I got to figure that out. Oh, you're going to fly.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:34.300
I'm flying to Canada also going to Montreal too far to drive.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:43.790
Oh yeah. I'm not quite ready for that. Yeah. I get that. I get that. I hope that I, I,

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:48.110
I'm not quite ready either, but at some point we're just going to have to roll the dice and

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:56.160
get out there. I actually talked to someone last week who said, so have you not had COVID yet?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.360
Like it was a thing like that was weird for me not to be in the, in club COVID.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:10.780
I have not been. Yeah, actually. So I, my daughter turned 12 and we waited on her until,

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:19.410
until she turned 12. So she's now completed on March 11th. She actually completed her

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:28.110
second dose. Oh cool. And her reaction to it was very much like mine. It was like,

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:37.180
uh, arm hurts cause I got a shot and kind of tired, right? It took my wife out. I may have,

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:46.000
my daughter may have, and it's a good chance that, that, well, I don't know. Who knows. And, uh,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.040
honestly, I'll just say like, except for like my fear of flying that I have to, I have to think

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:59.680
about now because on the COVID side, I'm just done with COVID. I'm done with it. I'm like, great.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.160
If it, if COVID wants to take me out, then take me out. Cause I'm going back to living life.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.040
That's, that's kind of my perspective. So what is it then that you don't want to fly for?

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:20.800
Uh, so I, it, it, it occurs to me that I have now a two year inset fear of flying due to be

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:28.160
trapped because of the COVID it's now subconscious because I don't want to be trapped in a freaking

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.640
box with surrounded by COVID infested human beings.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.280
Yet at the same time, you said you don't care. You just want to live your life. So

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.520
you need to, you have some cognitive dissonance you need to resolve.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:48.000
Right. My, the absolutely subconscious and conscious are not talking to each other.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.600
Completely agree. I'm sure this has happened to you. I don't know how many people are going to

00:37:53.600 --> 00:38:00.320
work, but on a lot of my big team meetings that I see, there will be people together in a meeting

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:05.920
room on the call. And it's weird to look at. I'm used to the total Brady bunch. Every little

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:13.180
box in zoom gets one face and one face only. And when that's changed, it's, it's like, what

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:24.380
I have had this week alone is now Friday. I have had three separate meetings

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:31.730
in an actual conference room with other people in the conference room with me.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:35.090
What's it like talking to someone in the 3d world?

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:43.520
It's wacky, right? Actually. And you can see there, like you can see on my whiteboard,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:49.840
bunch of scribbles. That was actually a meeting I had in my office earlier today. We were going

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.720
through an architecture, just the company secrets right there on your screen.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.560
Right. And, and then, uh, yeah, I should probably do something about that.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.520
It's not like you could read any of it though. Maybe AKS and pickles.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.760
Yep. That's what I wrote down for my notebook. So it's weird. I actually, I've been thinking about

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.360
this and I think there is a weirdness, like some of us do want to get back and get used to being

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.740
around people. And there's, there's value in that if you just described, but it's awkward.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:28.820
It's for me, at least it is. It's awkward seeing people and talking to people in person. It's

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.500
weird. I'm not, I it's, I want to be ready for it, but I'm not ready for it.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:39.970
Well, so there's, there is, there is an aspect of that. I am not ready for,

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:49.950
like I have spent two years essentially being the only one in my building, right? Essentially,

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:57.150
it's not entirely true. There's been, there's been about 10 cars here, but essentially my building

00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:08.540
has been a ghost town. And I'm like, Oh, what happens if in a couple of months, we go back to

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:14.060
the days where someone's knocking on my door, like every five minutes, I'm like, Oh my God,

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:22.860
that's good drive. Because I've gotten accustomed to peace, quiet. Someone tries to call me on

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:30.740
zoom and I don't want to talk to them. Oh yeah, I'm not in my office. Am I right? It's certain

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:37.550
things like that. Yeah. It's going to be, there's going to be a culture shift back for sure. And

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:43.870
it's all good. Yeah. And I think I don't know how it is with you. Like I am not requiring anyone on

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:49.070
my team to go back to work as their choice, but I'm not either. I'm beginning to feel like though,

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.380
and here's where, you know, a worthy of a quick conversation. I'm beginning to feel like

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.700
there's people that think they don't want to go back to work who maybe should go back a day or two

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:07.520
once in a while. Just try to figure out how to describe this, this feeling. Like when I went

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.920
to the office, I got a lot of work done. I saw some people. It was, it was good for my productivity

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:23.420
and good for my mental health. And I wonder if like I'm going in, like I want to go in again to

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:28.620
the office regularly because of that. I wonder if people, they're so used to working from home,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.420
they've been very productive for working from home, but I wonder if they will realize,

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.700
if they realize what they may be missing by not coming to the office once in a while.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:44.590
There's going to be some of that, like here, here at Microsoft,

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:54.100
we gave everybody, they had to proactively declare, but we gave everybody

00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:04.500
the option, which is entirely work from home, entirely, basically you're given three choices.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:15.470
Work from home, four choices. Work from home, entirely work from office, entirely

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:25.180
work from office greater than 50% or less than 50%. That last option, work from office less than 50%

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:34.780
is the least selected option. Because if you do that, Microsoft is proactively informed

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:42.060
that your desk then is at risk. Yeah, it's weird there. So I know you're in your own office is most

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:47.020
of Microsoft, it's a combination, right? Some buildings have their own offices, some are split

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:51.900
up. So us, like I've told them, I don't want to desk. Like if I go to the office, I'll be in

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:57.020
meetings, I'll be visiting people. We have plenty of touchdown spaces. I don't need a desk. Right.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:04.380
So that's, so touchdown spaces is what Microsoft is going to do this. So to satisfy the people

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:12.380
that are less than 50%, but it's change and human beings by nature don't like change.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:18.060
What works for us is we were, we kind of had that open seating before. So when I go in now,

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:23.820
I reserve a desk, it's a different one every time. Every desk has two monitors on it with

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:28.060
cabling to plug into your computer. And I just do that. I bring my own keyboard and mouse in

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:33.340
and I sit down and I get to work. And I can do that anywhere in any Unity office. And the other

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:38.860
interesting thing is, is that we are, I know Seattle probably for sure. And some other offices,

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:43.260
I think Montreal is in this state where if everybody actually went back, we wouldn't have

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:48.940
enough desks for them anyway. Right. Because we've done a lot of hiring during the pandemic

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:55.140
and not as much as we've done building. I think. No, Microsoft's had a big problem with that going

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:59.060
into the pandemic. Not as much now, probably have some extra chairs now.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:06.100
No, no, no. So the issue is, is that we were growing rapidly and it was becoming a problem

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:13.100
to try to figure out how, where we're going to put these people. Right. It was a sort of a, how,

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:20.140
what we couldn't build buildings fast enough. And so now everything's all changed. Like a whole bunch

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:26.300
of people have come a whole bunch of people have, have left. There have been people who have

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:33.100
spent their entire short career at Microsoft entirely in COVID. Yeah. We have, we have,

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:39.260
I have, I could look at my team. I should sometime. A big chunk of my team has never seen

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:44.380
an office. Well, some of us starting to go. In fact, I had one employee started the April of 2020.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:52.620
His team in my org just had a little mini team get together in this office in San Francisco.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.340
And he said, it's the first time since I joined the company two years ago, I feel like I'm part of a

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:01.820
team. So there is that. All right. We, we have talked and babbled and done some other stuff

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.540
and we got to get going. I am still not Ted Cruz. Cause I'm Alan and I have a brain and

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:12.140
in Brent is Ted Cruz with the brain. All right. Perfect. All right. We'll see you next time.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.980
Thank you everybody. Bye.
