00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
Whereas a lot of engineers that I work with one-on-one have this limiting belief that

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.980
they get to hide behind the screen and just do what they're told, implement a fun technology,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.840
learn interesting new stuff, new tech stacks, and that's it. That's all it takes.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:24.050
Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.130
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.250
else that comes to mind. Now, on with the show.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.210
Hey, everyone. It's Alan, and we're here for another AVE Testing Podcast, but it's the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.050
A-B-D podcast because we have a special guest here. We have Dogna Bietta. Say hi, Dogna.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.770
Hey, everyone.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.730
Super happy to have you here. Dogna has a website called themindfuldev.com, which I will link to in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
the show notes, and usually I remember. But I think rather than pause here and...

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.530
Oh, by the way, Brent's here too. Say hi, Brent.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.370
Hi. I think we're the D-A-B, right?

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.090
Oh, correct. We're the DAB podcast.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.890
Oh, right.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.810
Love it.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.890
Brent just dabbed on video. I think it's going to be a fun day.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.410
Yeah, it'll be great.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.890
So let's start off. Dogna, so happy to have you here. Excited. I've read about your stuff,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.850
and you reached out to me to be on this podcast, so I'm humbled based on what you've done.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.090
So can you please just tell us all, tell all three of our listeners a little bit about you

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.250
and where you came from and what you do.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.130
Yeah, absolutely. I love to do that. And first of all, thank you for having me. Really appreciate it,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.930
because one thing that I love doing is having conversations like the one that we're about to

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.850
have. So I'm super pumped you decided to schedule an hour of your day and hop on this conversation

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.690
with me. So in terms of what is it that I do, I moved away from being a software engineer,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.250
to being a career coach for engineers in tech. And the reason it happened, it's, you know, over

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.330
a decade, I would say, as I was going through my own career progression, I noticed that while

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.570
engineering at the very beginning was really stimulating and exciting and solving problems where

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.090
was really something that kind of lit my fire. As the time went on and on, I noticed that I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.660
wanted to do more of kind of one on one, deep conversations around engineering, but the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.660
engineering in itself was less and less fun, if that makes sense. So I've experienced burnout

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:46.620
in my career, that was kind of a huge trigger point for myself. And as a result of that burnout,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.740
I ended up seeking some professional help with therapy. And what talk therapy allowed me to do

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.460
was learning a lot about my internal mental programming. And I use some of that with my

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.820
clients that I coach one on one at this point in time. Because what's interesting,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.180
there's so many parallels between how we create computer apps, or any sort of applications,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.460
really, to how our minds work. So now I like to say that I move from programming computers to

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.420
reprogramming human minds, because that's what I do with my clients. We're already gonna go off

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.980
script here because because I think addressing burnout is something I do as a leader a lot,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.020
especially during the last couple years of weird work schedules and times and lots and lots of

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.900
Zoom meetings. But also, I think I can, I'll just speak for Brent here, you can tell me edit it out

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.120
later. But having a therapist has been so not just good for me, but I can't help but translate

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.320
what I learned from therapy and helping me coach people on my team. And I think Brent would

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.240
probably say the same thing. Brent is nodding his head. Yes, I absolutely would. A side

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.650
recommendation, I think it's just, I can't emphasize that enough. I can't tell my team,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.770
please use our benefits. But sometimes I want to say, please use our benefits. Because you get

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.540
help on so many different levels. So we had some questions we're going to talk about, but

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.620
I do want you to dive in a little bit more into burnout. So you mentioned that you were

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.820
facing burnout. Can maybe talk a little bit about how you recognized you were facing burnout

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.540
and what kinds of things you or what kinds of things you recommend to help deal with that in

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.980
people. Yeah, absolutely. So the number one thing was things that used to bring a lot of pleasure

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.340
to my life, like solving problems, creating a new deployment pipeline, making sure that the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.180
bug gets tracked and fixed within a day or working on a new product that is being written

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.980
from grounds up totally from scratch. That used to be exciting. And there was a point in my life

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.500
that I reached that it wasn't exciting anymore. So that's number one, if something used to be fun,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.820
and you used to find joy and pleasure in it, and then you're waking up every single day,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.060
literally feeling like, I gotta go to work today. Not wanting to do it, not having the energy,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.340
not having the motivation, procrastinating on the smallest of things, like reaching out to someone

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.220
on a different team that's working with your team. So whenever you're noticing those things,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:38.460
another huge flag to observe is irony and sarcasm as you talk to other people. Because all these

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.820
emotions that are related to burnout that are very negative, they tend to spill over, whether

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:51.100
we want them or not, it comes out in how we handle other people in conversations, in communication,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.960
whether we're being more or less rude. And that's something that you may not notice for yourself,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.720
but your partner might tell you, your manager might tell you like, hey, would you mind tone it down a

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:16.040
little bit? So you'll probably get it from feedback from other people. So in my case, I moved in my

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.760
professional career, I worked as a software engineer back at home in Poland, and I moved

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.840
to United States and continue my software engineer career here. And one thing I noticed was that, you

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.680
know, on one hand, it was a cultural difference, because I am much more direct than my American

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.960
coworkers were at the time. But because of the move, I experienced something that's called

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:49.990
complicated grief, where I essentially had to leave my old life behind to start a new life

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:56.710
here in the States with my husband. And I didn't handle it so well, it was really hard to let go of

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:06.070
that past life. Nobody died, but still, my life completely changed as a result of me moving.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:15.510
So with that, what happened was, I was the things kind of pancaked for me, you know,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:23.270
like one thing happened on top of the other. And when I went to therapy to seek help, oh, and I had

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:30.230
a baby a long time as well. So postpartum depression probably played a role. And I went to seek therapy

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.510
and seek professional help, because I was at the point where I was like, you know what, I need

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:42.950
someone to let me know how to get out of where I'm at, because it's like, I'm not handling it

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:48.950
very well. That was at that point in time. Now, one thing that I have to say too, is that for me,

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:56.790
talking through what I was going through was helpful. So I didn't need any medication of sorts,

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:03.700
because again, there's so much power in understanding that human brain is kind of like an app,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.860
and you can reprogram whatever you want, as long as you're open to understanding how

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.500
that programming was put into place, right? We don't have a good blame to access your brain and say,

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.540
oh, this is where those beliefs are coming from. I wish we did, but you know, that's kind of how

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:28.580
talk therapy worked for me, understanding how that, how my past experiences program my mind.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.140
So yeah, we're kind of going off track here as well. But I hope that answers your question.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:40.740
A lot of this is like hitting me right smack between the shoulder blades. So I'm glad we went

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.220
down there, but we're going to get onto the question I plan to ask you. Sorry about that.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:56.500
Well, before we do that, Digna, thank you for sharing that. We'll probably, we can talk about

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:10.410
it briefly off air. I have had my unfair share of dealing with mental illness. I know it is,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:18.570
it is part of your story. One, again, that I'm not yet willing to talk about on the podcast.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.290
Alan knows a great deal about it. But thank you for sharing that and being willing,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:34.150
being brave enough and willing to talk through that. I am also now going through therapy.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:43.670
This is a big aspect, right? An old manager of mine said, once you realize that you're sort

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:49.590
of digging your own grave, the very first thing you need to do is put down the shovel and

00:09:49.590 --> 00:10:04.470
recognize that you're sort of in a bad place and that you are still empowered to control your own

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:10.870
destiny, control your own life and move forward. Thank you for saying that. Now, going back to the

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.910
burnout thing, one of the things that your story reminded me of, are you familiar with Daniel Pink?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:26.150
Yes. Okay. And his three things of what motivates people, like I'm wondering if in your move and

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:32.730
your code, if there's any chance that you actually ended up losing your purpose. You're like, okay,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:39.530
I lost all my question. I lost all my friends. Everybody here does everything so freaking

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:48.570
weird. I got to be so nice and flowery. Before I could just tell people, you're a jerk, cut it out.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:55.610
Now I pay the cost. Yeah. Totally get this whole thing. And so I'm wondering.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:02.810
I love your question, Brent. So in terms of losing my purpose, when I was a teenager, what I wanted

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:08.170
to do is create the future. And one thing that sounded the most futuristic that I could

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:14.090
come up with was becoming an engineer and building robots. So I actually studied robotics,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:21.850
control engineering and robotics in university back in Poland in my home country. And the moment

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:27.290
I graduated, I was actually so excited I wouldn't have to be coding in my life ever again,

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:34.440
because I hated programming. In my classes, as I was learning how to build robots,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.200
a huge part of it is programming them. And that's on embedded level, and then on higher level,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.160
and then sending things back and forth through different types of networks. But I realized

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:55.240
that working as a robotics engineer, it takes so freaking long to build a robot that it wasn't

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.520
fulfilling anymore at that point in time. It just took too long to build them for me to find

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.960
pleasure and have that motivation. So having had that foundation of programming,

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:16.600
I did move into a job where I started to code more. And at that time, I also met my husband.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.880
So when I moved to the United States, I actually moved because I fell in love. And when people

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.480
fall in love, they do stupid things. So I just moved to a different continent, right?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:32.840
And regardless of losing that motivation, one thing that I noticed is, even though I was building,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.400
like in my most recent job that I was talking about where I experienced burnout,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.960
I was creating the future in the sense that I was building apps that were being deployed

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.480
and impacted millions of people every day. But it just didn't feel like it had

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:59.000
that big of an impact. Technologically, it was stimulating at the beginning

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:06.420
because I need to ramp up on being a mobile engineer very quickly. And that was the fun part,

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:11.620
learning new things. And one thing that I tell my clients all the time, a lot of the time,

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.980
we're using learning as a procrastination technique because it feels good to learn something

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:24.580
new. But sometimes what you actually need to do that is good for your career and that is good for

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:30.020
your growth just doesn't sound that fun. So we don't end up doing it, right? So going back to

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:36.820
the motivation, I realized that my motivation was impact, but the impact that I could have on

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:43.140
an individual's life was much more important for me than the impact I could have by impacting

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.740
quote unquote millions of people that were using the apps that I've built,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.420
if that makes sense, right? So the moment I started being more of a mentor, and then started

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.460
moving towards coaching because there are specific and important differences between mentorship and

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:04.420
coaching, which we can talk about later, I noticed that the moment I was able to help people have

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:12.840
similar aha moments that I had in my personal growth journey, and help them literally change

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:19.000
their whole life for the better. That was so much more fulfilling than any app that I could build,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.290
if that makes sense. No, it makes a lot of sense. And honestly, I think software teams need more

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.690
coaches. And I've, I don't know if I've done this on the podcast before, but I have definitely

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:36.890
talked to friends and my wife about this. Like someday, if I'm ever like a CEO, I'm going to

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:43.990
have, I probably call them coaches, but really, I want therapists on my, on my staff to work with

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:49.590
my team. They're so yeah, without going down that rabbit hole, I do. There's one thing you said,

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:54.070
you were in your notes that you had some experience talking about, I like to get into,

00:14:54.070 --> 00:15:02.870
especially in these economic times. There's a segue is what are the things an engineer can do,

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:08.470
or I was an engineer, an employee, a technical employee, a knowledge worker can do to help

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:16.390
lay off proof their career. Yes. So I was about to segue into that as well, kind of tying a little

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.550
bit along to what Brent said that, you know, previously in my job, I was able to kind of

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:26.710
be more upfront and direct to people. And then after I moved to United States, I wasn't able to

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:33.110
do that anymore. You know, one of the things that I learned that I can see now in hindsight

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.990
is that my communication, my style of communication was being a very aggressive communicator, right?

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:47.800
And whenever you're trying to get points across, what's really key is to, is to bring more of

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:54.840
EQ, which is like this emotional intelligence into the conversation, rather than just trying

00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:01.720
to push your points across, right? Which is a soft skill that's very much critical if you

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:08.600
want to lay off proof your career, right? So clear communication is something that I work with my

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.120
clients on. And that's one of the skills that helps you become lay off proof. And before we

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:21.500
dive into other skills, another thing I want to point out that the reason engineers are not as,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.260
well, as we experienced in the Q4 of 2022, we were...

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.670
Dang, now pause, pause for just a second. Looks like...

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.830
Okay.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.470
Based on my side, it looks like we lost Alan. Alan, are you there?

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.870
Oh, yeah, I lost a visual of him too.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.060
I don't know. I'm going to hope that, I don't sure if what happens with the recording when

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.860
Zeng Kaster decides to puke on my end, but I imagine you had a really good conversation there

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:58.300
that I will... It's again, every time I mention the word Zeng Kaster, Zeng Kaster does something

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.460
to screw up my audio.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.380
That was at least five minutes of our conversation where I'm like, oh, well, at least this is

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.460
something new for Alan to complain about. I have no idea what happened. All right.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.780
So, Dangna and I both officially forgot our question.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.180
Well, we were talking about emotional quotient.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.140
And...

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:22.860
Right.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.420
Actually, I'm going to tell a quick story, kick it back into you, and you can kind of

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.700
pick up wherever we left off, and I will magically stitch this back together

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.580
in some way that makes sense.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.020
Oh, just segue by complaining about Zeng Kaster.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.980
Zeng Kaster, Zeng Kaster, Zeng Kaster, I hate you sometimes.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.180
Your story about emotional quotient being direct reminded me of two things.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:49.020
One, there is a book called The Culture Map, which is fascinating, and it talks about how

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.340
you can say the exact same words to someone from Germany or Poland and something from

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.140
France, and they'll take it completely differently.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.020
And it's this map of how to communicate with different cultures, which is really important

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.340
if you're in a global group.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.860
The other thing it reminded me of is this story from Microsoft.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.740
I did this...

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.380
This is...

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.660
I was there for about 20 years, but maybe 15 years ago, I did this 360 review where

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:21.270
I was an up-and-coming leader, and they had all these people give this extensive feedback

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.430
and interviews about me, and I met with HR to go over my results, and they said,

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.430
Alan, people absolutely love the work you do.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.270
They think you can do anything, but they also think you're a little bit of an asshole.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.730
I can relate.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:37.530
Oh, my goodness.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.810
I can totally relate to that.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.410
So that's what reminded me, and that's when I began to study emotional quotient and pay

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:48.090
attention to how I was coming across, and ask people for feedback.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.130
I said, how did I...

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.450
My intent was this.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.410
What do you think happened?

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.250
And do those sorts of things.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.730
So I think that's where you're going.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.970
I want to drop that in, but I think what you were saying is by growing your emotional

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.570
quotient, you can help make yourself layoff proof.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.850
That's one aspect of it.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.210
I don't know what else I missed in there.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.490
If you're repeating yourself, it'll be beneficial for me.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.090
How do you go about...

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:17.370
How do you suggest going about improving your emotional quotient, emotional intelligence?

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:23.130
So first off, what you hinted at there was really key.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:31.530
Understanding that depending on where you come from, how people will come across will be different,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.820
depending on their cultural background.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.900
And there's a really cool tool that I use with my clients, which is called Hofstede model,

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:47.260
which helps you kind of compare on a very high level the different cultures that you

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:52.140
and your coworker coming from might perceive certain things differently.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.940
But in terms of becoming...

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.900
Increasing the EQ, one of the things is empathy.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:07.900
But I feel like empathy is important in communication, but also in having a

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.900
business understanding kind of setting.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:16.060
As an engineer, you've been hired to bring value to the business that you work for.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:22.060
How do you bring that value if you are not able to communicate with people across the board?

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:28.300
So one thing is communicating with your peers who have similar level of detail in understanding.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:34.460
How do you work with them on setting expectations, realizing that there may be some hidden

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.780
assumptions as you're trying to solve problems?

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.900
Or how do you ask clarifying questions?

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:45.820
Or how do you actively listen to someone when you're having a conversation and then

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.300
give them that kind of feedback so they get it that you're on the same page, right?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:56.860
So clear communication is really key here and being empathetic helps with that.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:04.060
So if you are also, anyone listening here, coming across as arrogant, and I know I did for sure,

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.820
there was this one time that I got feedback that I sounded like a total asshole.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.300
And the story was that the company I work for unfortunately had to make some cuts.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.900
They had to let people go.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.220
And we have this company-wide meeting and I'm asking this question because I thought

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.300
that the leadership level was not aware how the layoffs that they did and the engineering

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:35.500
people that they let go, how that impacted my day today in our deployment and caring for the apps

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:42.940
that we had. So I thought they were not aware. And then my boss's boss comes to me and tells me,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:49.500
D'Agna, why did you call our leadership team a bunch of idiots in front of the whole company?

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.940
And I'm like, that was not my intention. Is that really how it came across?

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:04.820
Like, it was just hard for me to understand, but that was on one hand, this lack of assertiveness

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:10.100
in how I communicated, because I never had to communicate assertively.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.780
I had to learn what it means and how to get my points across and how to

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.580
help people feel validated whenever we're having conversations.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.060
And one book that is fabulous on the topic is from this FBI negotiator,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:30.580
Chris Voss, who talks about how to negotiate as if your life depended on it,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.540
because he used to do that in his job as the FBI negotiator, right? Brilliant book,

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:42.020
highly recommended. And it gives a lot of feedback and points on how to become more assertive,

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:48.660
understand where people are coming from, but in that more critical setting that I feel is more

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.700
appealing to engineers than when talking about empathy, because I feel like the word itself

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.420
is not that appealing to engineers, if that makes sense. It's very valuable, don't get me wrong.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.660
It's just certain words have this associated context with them, and we feel a certain way

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:09.300
about them. And if someone says that trigger word, you're like, huh, not paying attention anymore,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.060
if you know what I'm saying. But going back to lay of proofing,

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:19.220
because that's kind of where you got cut off for a second there, Alan, was being clear communicator

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:24.340
is really key. And this is if you think about it, like transferable skill that will help you in

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:30.660
any job you have, whether you're a QA engineer, whether you're a software engineer, whether you

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:37.060
move on to being a team lead, being able to communicate clearly will help you in any sort

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:43.140
of job in any sort of career track that you might select for yourself. The other things are

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:50.740
collaboration, productivity and ownership, which is also something we can dive into more.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.860
Having that business acumen, which I hinted a little bit earlier, understanding what it is that

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:02.420
your business is doing and how you actually provide value within your day to day. And then marketing,

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:08.580
you know, a lot of engineers I work with have this limiting belief, my work speaks for itself,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:15.380
which it doesn't. Right. So yeah, like, there's so many topics here that we can dive into.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.340
Let me know which one sparks most of your interest.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.660
I will, but I just want to, I mean, everything you said a million percent on the mark. One thing

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.060
before I forget, I believe the Chris Foss book is it's called Never Split the Difference.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:38.150
Yes. I do recommend that as well. Jerry Weinberg says in a bunch of actually a couple of his

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.470
books that in software, eventually it's always a people problem. And even in the mythical man

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:47.590
month for Brooks calls out the problems in communication that plague teams trying to grow.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.230
Yet, even though the mythical man month is like a hundred million years old by now,

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:59.910
estimating a lot of teams, just a lot of people just don't realize yet how critical

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.200
not just in, you can say communication, not just talking, but you mentioned active listening and

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.960
listening for intent and asking clarifying questions, clarifying understanding.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.260
Like how many times, and this is a rhetorical question for you too on our listeners, has a

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:24.820
software team agreed to go do something and then walked out of the room with seven different ideas

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:32.740
of what they were going to go do. But what makes you more valuable is like everything you talked

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:39.300
about between marketing and communication and collaboration. These are the things that make

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.660
you a force multiplier on your team. These are the things that make you valuable. It's

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.540
far more valuable than the, you know, the coding's easy relatively than the human part.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.690
I'm going to make that statement. You can disagree with me or not. But what, so was there

00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:01.420
a question in there? I just wanted to underscore everything you said. Maybe dive into Brent's

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:08.380
laughing at me. The thing that I, when I coach teams, I think the thing that's maybe hardest

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:14.700
from all that, maybe talk about that a little bit more. How do you, like, how do you teach

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.660
or how do you, when you're coaching people, how do you coach around active listening and

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:25.420
clarifying questions and what tips do you have for people to get beyond shallow agreement?

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.100
That's a great one. Okay. We can talk about that, but I'm curious if Brent has anything to add in

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:38.620
terms of, you know, Brent always has things to add him managing people as well. Right.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:48.310
That's a dangerous invite, Taika. Yeah. A lot of what you said resonated.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:57.190
I don't know that you said this directly. I have been a manager for multiple years. I

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:08.790
have had, there's a story I had of an employee during a reorg. A couple of employees found out

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:15.510
that they might reorg to Brent. Oh no. So they went and did an investigation and talked to my

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:22.710
other employees. And they said, well, what can you say about Brent? And they said, Brent

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:33.110
is brutally honest. That was sort of, that is by the way, that is my, uh, my, what is it? Politically

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:41.260
correct way of translating asshole. Brent was brutally honest. And he said, literally,

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:48.550
number one, you really should not ask Brent any question you don't want the answer to.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:55.350
Because he will tell you. So one of the things you didn't said is so the emotional,

00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:01.190
so not only am I a huge believer in active listening, but I think the onus is on you,

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:10.870
the communicator to help encourage act. I'm going to invent a term, active hearing. You need to

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:17.270
understand what you said is empathy. A lot of people will go, oh, you need to feel what they're feeling.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:26.020
And that turns off a lot of people because right. It sounds very touchy feeling. And

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:34.660
right. I tell my employees, I have two emotions, uh, depressed and pissed off. And I use neither

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:44.180
of them very often. Right. But when I do, that's all I do. Okay. It's, but the sense of empathy

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:49.860
that I think is important, I think it's valuable to bring up negotiation. Um, and that sort of

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:57.380
skillset because the letter, the set of empathy that you really need at minimum is to understand

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:04.760
where they're coming from. It because, uh, you know, the old cliche, put yourself in their shoes.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:12.390
Now from negotiation tactics, I would say, okay, if you're in a, uh, a communication where

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:19.430
negotiation is involved, right? Really, if you set the other person and get them defensive,

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:25.510
then the conversation's over. All they're going to do is defend their position. You're not,

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:34.790
you're not going to create a win-win where everyone walks out happy. For me, the, the biggest book,

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:39.270
uh, that, that has transformed my point of view on that one is called getting to yes,

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:47.670
where it's, it's a whole series. It's, it's an older book. I'm an older guy. Um, but it's a

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:56.420
great series of how, what, what the guy did is go through and then they discussed the types of

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:04.740
arguments that are being made and how to, how to redirect those discussions into something that

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:12.300
then has a chance of becoming a win-win. Yes. In terms of, of the other thing that you said that

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:19.900
resonated with me, that reminded me a great deal. So I mentor a lot of folks and a lot of times I'll

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:29.140
get someone who is, who is new to management. And one of the biggest piece of advice that I give them

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:36.660
is look, you need to manage your employees. You need to produce business value. Like the,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.740
the reason why you're delivering, like the reason why your team is formed, that's so important.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.420
But in the back of your head, you always have to remember 10 years from now,

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:55.860
no one is going to remember what code you and your team wrote. No one, but the people who you

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:04.060
were managing, every single one of them is going to, is going to remember how you, you helped them

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:12.820
or didn't, how you got that product out or didn't. Right. So that the legacy, when you're a manager,

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:19.780
your legacy is the people that work for you and work around you. I don't know if that helps us

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:25.540
motivation, but yeah, that resonated and I'm going to cut myself off now.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.660
That's very kind of you Brent. I totally agree with what you were saying in terms of,

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:40.220
empathy being a word that for a lot of people triggers, like, this is touchy-feely. I don't

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:46.220
care about what other people are feeling. I just want to get my job done. Right. And here's the

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:55.400
realization that comes with empathy that, I like to highlight is that let's look at the neuroscience

00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:00.920
of it. Let's look at human evolution. Let's look at the tools that you have available as a human

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:07.800
being in order to help other human beings cooperate with you. Super helpful in the work

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.480
setting, right? Especially if you're part of a team and trying to accomplish something.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.800
So whenever, you know, we took, we look at it from the perspective of neuroscience

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.040
and what it has to say about body language, what it has to say about creating a safe space,

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.040
psychological space so that people don't either shut down and stop listening completely to what

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.000
you're saying or become defensive, like you said, right? Whenever they're becoming defensive,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:42.120
then whatever you say is not going to matter because they're protecting their ego. They're

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.240
protecting themselves because they are feeling under threat and under attack. So if you, if

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.960
we look at it from the neuroscience and evolutionary perspective, again, this is a

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:59.340
highly valuable and critical skill to help you get other people on board with what is it that

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.460
you're trying to accomplish, right? Whether that's shipping a new product, creating a new feature,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:13.180
agreeing on maybe creating a new team, right? For a research project or making sure that you

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:20.140
implement a certain process within your company because it could increase business value. So at

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:26.780
the end of the day, just like you were talking about it, Alan, a while ago is that at the core

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:33.420
as an engineer, what you're doing is creating a product or making sure that the product is good

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:39.180
for other people and you're doing it with other people. So people are key there. Whereas a lot

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.260
of engineers that I work with one-on-one have this limiting belief that they get to hide behind

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.540
the screen and just do what they're told, implement a fun technology, learn interesting

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:54.300
new stuff, new tech stacks, and that's it. That's all it takes. And this is not at the core of

00:33:54.300 --> 00:34:01.420
anyone's job. Yeah, it's fun. And it can be really entertaining and stimulating intellectually,

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:07.260
but that's, what's fun for your career isn't always beneficial and isn't going to get things done.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:13.260
Right? So it kind of goes back to what your priorities are in terms of how do you see your

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.420
career going? Where do you want to go? Are you comfortable in the spot that you're in?

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.860
Do you want something more? Most of the people that I work with,

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:27.740
they feel that hidden potential within them and they want to do more. They're just not aware how

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:33.420
they're stopping themselves because what happens is most of those limiting beliefs, like my work

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:38.860
speaks for itself. I don't have to be an empathetic listener because empathy is blah.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.980
Most of those limiting beliefs are hidden in the blind spot.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:50.380
And until someone who has the experience of either going through the exact same experience as you did

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.660
or coaching other people and helping them get out of that rut, getting unstuck, you're not going

00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:00.220
to be able to see it for yourself because it's exactly in your blind spot. Right? So that's

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:05.260
something that I do with my clients, addressing those limiting beliefs that they have in terms

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:12.380
of one, how they operate, how the world operates, how to work with other people. And going back

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:18.250
to tips on active listening. There's a really cool exercise that's very simple. If you want to

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:26.100
see if you're a good listener, is to close your eyes and try to count from one to 50. Right?

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:34.980
And see how that goes. Because I mean, presumably, if you're not able to listen to your own voice

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:40.490
in your own head, someone who you probably like, how are you going to be able to listen,

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:46.730
actively listen to what other people have to say. So that's a fun exercise to do and see whether or

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:53.270
not you can actually focus on yourself counting to 15 your own mind without disruptions. If you're,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:59.670
if you have, you know, good listening skills. And the second thing is, I would say, a lot of

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:07.140
communication is around intent and understanding the intent of other people. Right? So whenever

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.020
you're coming to a conversation, you're trying to negotiate something, even if it's something as

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:17.770
simple as what we're getting for dinner tonight. There's this really cool quote by Jack Hanfield.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:25.610
I really like his work in the books that he has. So one of the things that he says

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:36.330
is that at every point in time, what you're and anyone is doing is, you know, doing it in

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.410
order to meet their needs with the information, the awareness and the skills that they have.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:46.730
So if they're coming across as a jerk, maybe they don't have the skills to communicate better.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:52.150
Or maybe the information that they have, if they keep asking the same question again and again and

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:57.270
again, maybe they're not able to process the information you gave them. Or maybe that

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:03.670
information wasn't clear for them, or they need to get it delivered in a different way.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:10.520
Or, you know, for some reason, their needs aren't being met. So they're not really able to focus

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.680
what it is that you're telling them. So whenever you come to a conversation,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.440
understanding this basic psychology, that at any point in time, people are doing their best,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:27.320
given the skills, information and awareness that they have in order to meet their needs,

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.680
that makes any conversation so much easier, because it's not about you anymore. Right? So

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.800
you don't have to get defensive. It's the baggage that they bring into the conversation

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:43.880
that can help you get them on board with whatever is the idea that you're presenting, like what to

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:50.710
have for dinner. I hope that makes sense. No, that makes so much sense. So much good stuff in there.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:57.960
I'm going to build on it a little bit. If I remember what's your name? Tacos. Tacos. What?

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.600
That's what people say. So, oh, tacos for dinner, of course.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.840
See, I was actively listening. Yeah. I was thinking by telling

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.280
Brent to actually count to 50, that getting distracted, you put him into his depressed mood.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:19.480
Now, actually, actually hold on to your question. I see that you're trying to form it anyway.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:25.930
But that one to 50, I simulated that and I would actually say, everyone will go, oh, of course I

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:33.370
can do that. It's one to 50. Right? But the second you actually begin to do that, you realize,

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:40.810
wow, 50 is a long count. Right? And the reason why I think that's an important training for

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:47.610
active listening, and I would actually even further and say, and do it every day. Start the

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:55.290
day closing your eyes, counting to 50, because it is practice for the coaching habit. Right? That's

00:38:55.290 --> 00:39:05.370
something that we've talked on here before, is a big aspect of it is slow down, spend a little

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:14.490
extra time listening with the point of understanding and with what Doug is saying,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:22.330
understanding where are they coming from in terms of their skills or their capabilities?

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:27.930
Can you understand what their needs are? Tying it all together, that's all helpful to sort of

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:36.090
construct a win-win conversation. All right. So to me, when I went from being the asshole,

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:40.330
and the difference was I would go into a meeting knowing I was right, because I was right most of

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:47.400
the time. And when people were wrong, they were obviously not as smart as me. And I didn't need

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:53.800
to listen to them. That's the way I felt. Because unfortunately, at that time in Microsoft,

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.760
that's the way my mentors operated. And that's the way I was indirectly coached to act.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:03.830
You know, I love to learn stuff. I don't know if it's procrastination, I just love it no matter

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:08.390
what. And I started studying emotional quotient, but what really got me to engage in active

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:13.110
listening was the second level of listening. There are the words coming out of your mouth,

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:19.020
but then there's also the analysis of when I'm talking, how am I coming across trying to read

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.860
the room? And then when people are talking to me, if they say something I think is wrong,

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:29.820
or I disagree with, I can clarify understanding. What I'm trying to do is really understand what

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:36.460
I tell my team all the time is behavior comes from motivation. So what can I do to understand

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:41.820
the motivation of where they're coming from? And by clarifying understanding, I am coming

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.980
from programming. I spend a lot of my time as a professional debugger almost at Microsoft.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:51.180
I want to debug where they're coming from. I'm going to ask clarifying questions, help me figure

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:57.500
out what is the motivation behind this decision or behavior they have, which is super interesting to

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:05.020
me. So now I'm actively listening because I want to, when I have a good conversation in a one-on-one

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:10.460
or a small group meeting, this conversation is happening at a couple different levels.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:16.700
And I can't help but engage. And this question around, I will use language on my team around

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:22.710
to clarify understanding of the law or to talk about next steps to make sure we're clear on next

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:29.740
steps. Then one thing we do a lot, which Deignan did about 10 minutes ago was you get much better

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:35.500
alignment when everybody talks. And one thing we talk about when we do active listening is drawing

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.700
people into the conversation if they haven't spoken yet or spoken in a while. When you drew

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:46.380
Brent and I go, ah, she doesn't know that Brent talks forever, but she's doing the right thing,

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:53.580
which is really cool. So one other thing, more you talk, this is like stuff you're gluing together

00:41:53.580 --> 00:42:01.210
a bunch of pieces that I think is a systems thinking, which is missing from a lot of engineers

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:06.020
when they get stuck in their career. When I come out of college, I can just program. Then people

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.700
who are just programming all day wonder, well, I write really good code. My code speaks for

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:16.630
itself. How come I'm not growing? And it's all those things you talked about where you have to

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:24.070
begin to communicate and lead other teams. You talked about being proactive. And one of the

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:29.270
things I'm talking to some of my senior engineers about, as people who want to get the senior is

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:33.670
there's a point where, and Brent knows this from happens at senior at Microsoft as well,

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:39.640
is maybe it's industry-wide. There comes a point where when you first start, you are

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:46.520
told what to do, but the more senior you get, the more you are expected to figure out

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.960
what the right thing to do is. Does that ring true for you? I'd be curious when you

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.360
talked about proactivity, is that part of it? Or maybe can you expand on what you meant by being

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:02.520
a proactive engineer? Absolutely. So like in terms of growing your career, what is it that

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.800
you want to do? Right? Because a lot of the time becoming, getting into tech is like this

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.400
comfy, cushy job that gives you amazing benefits. And you get the social status too,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:20.360
like, oh, I work at Microsoft. I'm a cool person because how many people get to that particular

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:26.920
position? Or I make whatever salary I make, and I'm really living a comfortable life now.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:33.080
So that's something that people kind of follow and it's evolutionary, right? Because we want to

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.920
provide and we want to set ourselves up for success. But then what happens is whenever we

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.440
get comfortable, that motivation is often lacking because there's lack of alignment with our values.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.880
Right? So just like in my case, I realized that what was really valuable for me was to have

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:56.600
deep kinds of conversations on a very personal and deep level and help people in a one-on-one

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.240
setting. And I'm getting goosebumps as I'm telling you this. But for me, this is something

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:07.240
that I wake up and I want to do whatever's going on in my life. I just love doing what I do,

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:13.800
coaching. And discovering that that was a value for me took quite a while. I didn't like

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.640
wake up one day and just knew what I wanted to do. So there's a discovery process involved.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:26.520
But you have to be kind of become conscious. And maybe it's part of maturity. Maybe it's

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:33.160
part of the phase of life that you're in, whether or not you have a family or people depending on you

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:40.840
in your salary or not. So it's really about this personal growth trajectory and how a career

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:48.680
can support a life with meaning, a life with purpose, a life that you'd be excited being

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.760
99 years old telling your neighbors, your grandkids, and people who are willing to listen.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.520
I'm really on board here with what you were talking about in terms of productivity and leadership,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:07.240
but more self-driven. What is it that you want and how you can structure a career around doing

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:12.920
what it is that you want? Because I mean, tech has so many opportunities and so many chances to even

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.360
create certain roles for yourself within a company if you're able to communicate the

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:24.090
business value that it was going to bring. Now, in terms of the education, if you think

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:34.330
about how we're educated and how the professional life works, we're primed to think that way.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:41.770
The work speaks for itself. Why? In college, what do you do? You get assignments, then you send them

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:46.650
to your professor or TA, they go through your code and they see what works, what doesn't,

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:51.530
if there are comments, if they're not, if it's well-written or not, if there's a compile or not,

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:56.410
and then you get a grade because someone went into your code and looked at it.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:46:02.810
In a professional setting, people who are decision makers about your promotion, race, advancement,

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.930
they typically don't have idea what it is that you're doing because you're working kind of

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:14.730
underneath the hood. So as long as things work and the software is producing what it's supposed

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:22.090
to be producing functionally, nobody cares. And yes, I know you're going to say, yes, people care.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:29.720
That's true. But what I'm trying to say is we're primed to think in a way to get that feedback

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.960
for the work to speak for itself. I hope that makes sense. And then last thing that I wanted

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.440
to mention is whenever Alan, you were talking about being in the room thinking, yeah,

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:45.800
I'm smarter than them. I've been doing this. I'm the subject matter expert here. So of course,

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:51.640
they should listen to me. And that's a huge assumption that you're coming to a conversation

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:58.600
with. I was very, very wrong to be clear. Well, to be completely honest here, there was a point

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:03.320
in time where I believe the same thing. Like, yo, you hired me to do this job and now you're not

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.760
listening to my feedback. What's wrong with you? So I can totally resonate with that kind of

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:14.600
thinking. But the truth is that the people that you were having conversations with, or I was

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:21.320
having conversations with at that point in time, they had a different perspective. And if you're

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:29.880
looking at value, business value, as that unifying perspective, that where you can tell

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.520
who was more right or who was more wrong, because engineers, again, tend to chase what's

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.800
intellectually stimulating, not necessarily what's fun, not necessarily what's best for business.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:49.400
So I couldn't agree with you more. I want to spend all day, like there's so much good information

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:55.800
in what you're talking about, Dogna, that I would love to spend all day. I think our listeners and

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.040
thousand other people need to hear this stuff. It's just so important. So,

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:06.520
but the clock says it's about time to wrap up, but I just want to thank you for hanging out with

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:13.160
us today and just dropping knowledge bombs right and left. Super fantastic. So thank you so much

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.520
for being here. Absolutely. And I appreciate again, you having me and you know, like I love

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:23.240
to give all these value knowledge bombs, as you call them, left and right. Because at the end of

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:30.520
the day, you know, there's a difference between knowing things and a difference in living from

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:36.840
that place. And I hope you could tell that I walk my talk. So everything that I help my clients with

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:42.520
is something that I've had to learn the hard way. And so, you know, if anyone is looking for that

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.400
kind of feedback for that kind of acceleration in their career, they're more than welcome to check

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.760
out my website, themindfuldev.com and see if they want me to be there to support them

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:58.600
in their growth because I can absolutely do that. I think that I can think of lots of people you

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:05.720

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:15.000
