WEBVTT

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm Alan. I'm Greg. And we're back for episode 52. 52 of AB Testing. We have now gotten to an episode that is

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.150
older than you. Yes, finally we're older than me. Should we just dive right in? I don't know how to

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.430
approach this subject. Oh wait a minute. Actually, well we start with the tangent. Welcome to AB

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.110
Testing. This is your first episode. This is normal. Hey, so remind me you're 52. So are you a Gen X?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.270
I am not 52. I am 51. 51 nevertheless. I am a Gen X. I'm on the borderline. I don't think,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.670
I don't feel like, I don't feel nor act like a boomer. Nor I'm, I would say closer to Gen X,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.190
but I really, I don't identify with labels. I'm my own person. Well that's why it's called Gen X.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.190
With my own unique values and responsibilities and contributions to the society.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:14.190
So I don't, I don't really appreciate you trying to label me. I heard a fact yesterday that next year

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.970
is predicted to be the peak of the Gen X population. The maximum Gen X's that will ever be alive

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.490
will only be alive next year. So I'm going to start dying. I'm actually, I've started dying.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.240
Am I going to die? We're all going to start dying next year. Am I part of the Deadpool?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.540
Yeah, for sure. That's great. I'm pretty excited about that. Yeah, well I mean it's interesting,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:58.240
right? We just this last holiday, we saw George Michael die. We saw Carrie Dyer die. Like big

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:07.360
flares that were key to our generation growing up. Yeah, I think I saw, I think I saw a Rogue One,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.730
if I recall, the day she died. Oh yeah. We did our road trip. My team took us out for

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.480
a road trip. We did our road trip to Bozeman, Montana. Look at Bozeman for our three listeners

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.280
in Bozeman. I guarantee there are no listeners in Bozeman, but we drove to Bozeman and back,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.160
no problemo. But we stopped, we were in Missoula of all places on the way back, spending the night

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.100
and thinking, maybe we should go see a movie. Oh look, Rogue One's playing. Oh look, it's

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.380
playing in 3D IMAX. Oh look, we're going. Wait, wait, Missoula had a 3D IMAX? Yeah. Wow.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:57.890
That's what I said. Like I was meant to go, meant to go. Nice. So we did that, it was fun. And also

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.770
on that trip, so what do you do on road trips? Do you take road trips with your family in the car?

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.450
Not as much as we used to since my daughter was born, but yeah. Do you just all sit and sing

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.180
along in the car? What do you do? Sometimes, like there was one trip when my boys were a lot younger

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.500
where we basically listened to the soundtrack for Polar Express on repeat. Oh god. About that.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.900
Saw and Hot Chocolate is fantastic. Maybe I will die in 27, maybe I'll die right in this episode.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.380
So we're on this road trip. Nowadays, everyone's got screens and so I turn on whatever friggin'

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:46.020
podcasts and they are jellin' out. Yeah, the Tesla as a podcast reception built into the tuner is kind

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.250
of nice. We listened to a few episodes of 99% Invisible. Oh nice. Thank you for the suggestion.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.850
Yeah, what did you think? It's a good show. I actually liked the last show, my favorite

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.210
shows are the last two because they're little mini episodes. Yeah. And they had the episode

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.650
about this soccer stadium in this country in South America right on the equator and the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.250
mid-field line is right on the equator. So it's like North versus South.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.540
I think it's pretty cool. Little things like that I think are fascinating.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.380
They have a couple hundred and so there's a lot of their past episodes that I haven't listened to yet.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.060
Speaking of soccer, I was listening to the latest episode of Total Soccer Show last night

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.780
and they interviewed this guy who is basically a soccer data scientist. Cool.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.310
And it was really cool. He's just like a total math geek but totally knows everything about the game

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:52.030
and he was talking about the stat called expected goals. And it's interesting. They take

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:05.060
all the shots and basically it's the odds of that shot going in. Like if you're 60 yards out,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.160
it may be as high as like a 50% rate. Maybe the highest give you a 60% rate of going in.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.010
But from farther out. 60 yards out? No, I said from six yards out. Oh, six yards out. Yeah,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.650
if you shoot from 25 yards out, maybe you have about 5% just due to angles and everything.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.050
They've calculated like every location on the field. Take a shot from there. It has this

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.170
percent chance of going, of beating the keeper and going in the net. And then

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:40.720
they've done models of thousands and thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of shots.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.960
And as you do with these things, you train them, you use the data to train the model and

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.320
it's pretty accurate now. So they can look at it. They can, it's just very interesting. I never

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.990
really knew what the stat meant, but like if you're arsenal and you take 16 shots and

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.470
if you add up, if you add up all the percentages of the shots you took,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.120
it gives you an expected goal number of maybe it's like 2.5. Is that per game? No, it's like

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.560
during that game, like in the shots you took, you should have scored two and a half goals.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.160
Not that you can score a half goal, but you're a statistician, you get it. And then

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:27.790
it can tell you things about, are you finish rate of the striker or that should roughly match up.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.180
Sure. So you have to shoot the score, of course. One thing I always say,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.140
I coached a team a few years ago and then on my teams I was playing forever and ever and ever.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.780
I always said you have to shoot the score. Sometimes I go, I want a little better shot.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.980
I want a little better shot. And you dribble around a little bit, but you get the shots off

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.220
and then maybe only 10% shot. But if you take, this is true if you've played hockey or soccer,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.500
you know this. If you only, if you take a shot that has a 10% chance of scoring,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.580
if you shoot a lot of those, eventually one's going to go in. Right. And then they have higher percentage

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.500
shots. So just, and also there's one thing you learn playing soccer is you want to shoot a lot

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.660
because you want to get the goalkeeper tired. Sure. It makes it easier to score later. You don't want

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.700
the guy just to stand around, not to do anything until you finally shoot at him. Stephon Fry in the

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:18.590
105th minute with the save of the century. Did you watch the final? No, you suck. So does,

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.590
do you know if their model accounts for, uh, where in the game in terms of the time? No,

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.790
it's shots being taken. I do not think it does. Uh, I think that maybe just adds too much

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:35.710
variability. I'm not sure. Oh, I'm sure it does. I mean, um, most teams have multiple keepers,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:43.900
right? How often do keepers stay in the whole game? Uh, every game almost all the time,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:51.120
every game, all the past. And we're back. We took a little break there because basically because

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.200
your host Allen, the A of AB testing is a little bit of a dipshit.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.410
And what that means in human speak is that, uh, we recorded the first part of the podcast off of

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:09.330
my PC laptop microphone. I'll do some blending and sound magic later. And maybe you won't notice,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:15.010
but maybe you're also deaf. I don't know, but we're back on real microphones. And we were just

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:21.010
talking about the fact that the keeper in less of an injury is never ever subbed in soccer. You

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:27.010
only allowed three substitutions a game. Oh really? Yeah, total. Okay. So they, and you can't like

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.530
sub out and go back in new information for brain salty gunner. He knows this stuff. So

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:40.320
they're likely to sub in and out their strikers that I would presume. Well, in and out, like whoever

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.960
is the most tired, usually it's a, it depends, uh, often not the defenders, the defenders,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.000
sometimes the wings will run more, but it's the midfield players and the strikers that run

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.680
and sprint a lot and make you a little tired. Uh, gotcha. So, and maybe for an injury,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.560
you have to sub someone out too. It was good to save one. The only time I've ever seen a

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.320
goalkeeper substitution is you may have a situation where you're getting towards the end of an over

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.920
time game. You're about to go into penalty shots and you have a sub left. I've only seen this like

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.040
a few times ever, but the only time I recall ever seeing a goal, a goalkeeper substituted,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.520
except for an injury was when the backup keeper is like this rock star or much better

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.000
at saving penalty kicks. Sure. And they'll bring him in because they think they're going to have

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.400
penalty kicks. They want to bring in the better. I think I've seen that at, um, either the last

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:45.580
Olympics or the, the thing in Brazil that we just had world cup just had two years ago. Yeah.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.900
Could be. I've seen it. I've seen it at least once where they switched out the keepers,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.380
but I don't remember enough. Was a tournament a while back now. I can't remember which one

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:00.740
it was or what it is. We're, um, if there's extra time. So if there's a, if it's a, in soccer,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.460
as I educate Brent, the three already know this in, in soccer football, the beautiful game.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.940
If, if it's a game that means something where there has to be a winner, normally if there's,

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.420
if it's a, like a league game, it was tied at the end, it's a tie. But if it's a game where

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.580
there must be a winner, they'll play after the end of 90 minutes, they'll play an extra two,

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.140
15 minute halves. They call extra time, at least in the States, they call it extra time.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:29.460
Uh, and at the end of that, then I'll go to shootout, right? What I have said, I forget which

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:36.190
tournament I saw this in, or if it was just a very vivid dream, but I do recall, uh, some

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.710
tournament where if it went to extra time, they're allowed one extra sub through a lot of fourths

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:48.180
sub during the extra time, which I think is a really good idea. I think the, uh, the, the rule

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:54.320
was a little bit, it's a little bit too strict. You end up with dead people at the end of 120

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.020
minutes. In fact, I don't know the stats on this and we are welcome to way off in tangent.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:10.930
I don't know the stats, but I, I would bet that, uh, both the rate of loss in the game following

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.090
an extra time game for teams is very high. I think they lose at a higher rate because

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:22.370
they're just beat that extra 30 minutes takes a lot out of you. How far, how spaced are games?

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.530
Usually a week apart. Oh, I would guess that that wouldn't have that much of an impact.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:35.410
I don't know if you, if you ran, um, if you sprinted like 12 miles and, and kicked in the

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.810
shin in the face for two hours, would you feel like ready to do it again a week later?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.580
Certainly wouldn't feel like doing it on Wednesday, but you've ran, uh, marathons and many marathons.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.140
Yeah. And, uh, I wouldn't have won a run one a week later, but I'm old. So I think maybe

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.260
that would also, now I'm, I'm all geeking out on the stats. I bet it would also depend on the

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.740
age of the team. If the average age of the team was like 24, probably wouldn't make a

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:07.020
bunch of difference. If the average age of the team was 34, maybe a lot more difference.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.340
Is there a team where the average age is 34? Well, my rec team.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.790
Okay. I'll repeat my question. Is there a team? All right.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.990
Screw you guys. Do we have any topics covered today? Are we done?

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:35.500
Uh, yeah, we're good. So I'm Brad. No. Um, well, we have, uh, items up on our, uh,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.860
yeah, quit babbling. Can bend board. Shall we cover them? We may as well. We already covered

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:47.420
it's episode 52. Thank you for listening this far. I don't know why, but thank you. I mean,

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.950
I know why I'm thanking you. I don't know why you're listening. So a little bit of big news,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.990
maybe big news. Think it's big news, Brent. It's big news could be epic. It's definitely going to

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:06.400
have a, we, we suspect that we'll have some impact to the podcast. Probably not much.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:16.880
We hope not. We hope not. So, um, there's a change to AB testing where one of the members

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.920
of AB testing has decided after 22 years that his time at Microsoft is over.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:33.900
Yes. Sadly, uh, we'll have to change how AB testing is communicated. It'll no longer be

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:44.380
the podcast with those Microsoft guys. True, true, true. And all potential ideas of there ever being

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.100
a second edition of how we test Microsoft, how we test software at Microsoft are done

00:13:49.100 --> 00:14:01.740
because I, as of next Friday, no longer work at Microsoft. So, uh, yeah. So actually,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.860
I don't know when we'll release this episode, but let's presume it'll happen before you leave.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:13.060
It will. It will. That's the plan is I think I will, uh, Simul release this podcast,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.860
maybe this podcast, and then I'll do a nice farewell blog post shortly after probably

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:24.580
mid next week is the release date. And so presumably your team all knows already

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.820
my team all knows I have, uh, did any of your team listen? Did they even know? No,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:36.340
but one of my, one of my employees just started following me on Twitter. So he'll see the post of

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.390
the podcast. Gotcha. And he follows me on LinkedIn. So he'll see the post of the podcast there,

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:46.340
but I don't know. He's actually listened. It's quite blessed the fortitude of the three,

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.300
but it's quite an endeavor to get through an episode of AB testing

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.270
because sometimes we get like 15 minutes into the podcast. We haven't really said anything yet.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.710
Or yeah.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.550
Rhetorically. Um, all right. So let me pepper you with questions.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.710
So let me, uh, I guess so. Go ahead. You start. Uh, so where are you going?

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.340
Not even any four plays go right, right to the right. Like the, give me,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.000
give me the money shot. Alan. Okay.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.560
Gonna go right there. So what led you to this decision?

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.790
This would be a better way to lead up to this. So I have been, and as you know,

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:34.430
we haven't talked about this on the air, but as Brent knows, I've toyed with the idea of

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:41.150
trying something besides Microsoft for at least five years. Things come up. I look at them and

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:49.390
either it's a location move. I don't want to do, or it's not the right fit for me or it's not, uh,

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.610
frankly, it's not the right, uh, financial situation for me.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:02.820
And then, uh, a bunch of things fell together. Uh, my wife and I were, we were on this road trip

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.340
and yes, the kids were in the back doing screen time and, or they were reading,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:12.260
we made them get books. Like my son, like this 500 page novel made him read it. He liked it.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:20.510
Wow. And, and you still have your kids? I think so. Like your kids don't know about DSHS.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:28.780
My kids are good. Uh, a shout out to my kids. I'm a proud parent today. They were both cast in

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:34.530
the school play this night, a musical. Cool. So I'm excited about that. Except now I have to

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.890
listen to them sing around the house for the next four months, but it's all right. There are

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:43.490
worse things. So anyway, wife and I are talking and listening to podcasts, like 99% invisible.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:47.970
I couldn't get her to listen to total soccer show with me, but we check some other things out and

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:53.570
we're talking in and everyone's talking about like, when you're going to leave Microsoft,

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:59.100
you're going to go. And I thought, well, maybe after this product shift, probably another three

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.620
or four years, he goes, why don't you go now? I said, I can't leave now. There's stuff to do.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:10.740
And like, what? And we'd going back and forth and back and forth. And, uh, as I've told my team,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.860
it's like leaving Microsoft, it was kind of hard, but I'm okay with that. Leaving the Microsoft

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:22.020
teams team, a little hard. It's a cool product. Had a lot of fun there. It's leaving my team of

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.860
this team I've grown and built. It's been the hardest. And I was, I'm actually helping to

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:33.840
recruit my replacement to run my team. And I thought this is a rarity of Microsoft. I have

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:40.000
this team that is super well respected across my entire org. They're all really good people.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.880
So good. In fact, you own a doctor retires or quits, he sells his private practice.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.760
People shouldn't interview for my job. I should be able to sell it to them because they have a

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.560
ready-made team that rocks. All they have to do is step in and provide a little bit of leadership,

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.160
a little bit of management overhead. And they have this sweet gig. That's not fair.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.650
They should have to work for that crap. Yeah. It's a little different, right?

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:10.370
The doctor selling his clientele, essentially. Whatever.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.790
Right? Selling an income stream.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:22.460
Yeah. Okay. So where was I? Oh, so it kind of came to the conclusion because I've had,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:32.260
I always have something sort of tickling. Like I could approach this and coinciding with this

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:38.820
conversation. I was talking to a company that I've talked to them off and on for at least a year.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:46.500
I've known people there. I really admire what they do. In my sort of investigation to whether like,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:53.060
I don't know, maybe there's dark closets that sit there. I exhaustively googled the crap out of

00:18:53.060 --> 00:19:00.020
like this company and glass door and looking for dark skeletons in their closet. And I could find

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.500
none. All I could find was people that loved this company and said, good things about it. I said,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.060
hey, I've seen them at conferences. They're great. Hell, hey, their user community is fantastic. And

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:16.980
this is great. And I thought, well, gosh, that sounds fun. And also, they're about a 3,000 person

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.980
company. So when I started at Microsoft, we were a much smaller company then, about 14,000.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.820
And now we're more than 10 times that big. Yep. Way more.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:33.900
I don't know. Anyway, somewhere in there. Yeah. So anyway, we talked and as the stars align,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.460
by the time we got back home, it's like, holy crap, I'm quitting Microsoft. And I'm going to

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.740
take a job as a director of quality at Unity 3D. Going back into management.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.140
I've been managing for the last year. Going back to writing reviews.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.780
I've been writing reviews for the last year. I just finished eight connects.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:20:01.940
Did you? Okay. So anyway, if you're not familiar with Unity, and a lot of our listeners are,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:08.180
because I know we have a couple listeners in the game industry, Unity 3D is a cross-platform game

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:15.940
authoring platform used for practically every mobile game in the world. Not all of them,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.220
but Pokemon Go is a good example of something recently done using Unity.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.460
Even some Xbox games. Not even. There are some Xbox games.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.900
There's a lot of them. Yeah. So I'm excited. And they've acquired

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:35.300
a couple interesting things happened in the last year. I talked to them a year ago. I was totally

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.660
interested then, but the job just had too much travel for me to pull off. It was like 60% travel.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:49.940
That's a lot. Yeah. So, but I liked the company and stayed in touch. And some interesting things

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:56.980
happened over the last year. The big thing is that they acquired two big things. Big thing number

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:06.020
one, they acquired four service companies and integrated them into Unity. Cloud Build, ads,

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:13.940
very important. This is embarrassing that I'm pausing. When I say Cloud Build, ads, multiplayer.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.380
You guys are working on Xbox. That can be a pain in the butt. And telemetry.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.820
And these are not like things that, of course, things that they use themselves, but as a game,

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:32.530
as a Unity developer, a developer using the Unity platform, you can integrate any of these services

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:39.600
into the app you're building. Yes. And they should. Absolutely. They may not need multiplayer,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:49.460
but they may. They may not. But they may. No, I was thinking about a colleague of ours,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:22:00.690
Jimbo. And the amazing things I've seen in terms of how telemetry drove game development.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:09.410
If Jimbo was a data scientist, I could only dream what sort of things he would have

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.930
done in the show Intellivance in the last few years.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.990
So, the big thing on the services side is that they need someone to come in and corral their

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.870
testing quality. And with me, it's not just testing and test execution. It's around

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.910
what's the quality strategy, what's the integration with development team, what's

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.630
all up quality. But they also need a lot of consolidation. Imagine if you acquire four

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.150
companies, you have four sets of methodologies, four sets of tools.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:43.680
And most importantly, you said they acquired four companies. So five distinct cultures.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.920
That's going to be the biggest challenge.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.640
And they've had these for a while, but my job is to come in. And again, I haven't even been

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:56.800
there a day yet. I don't start until February, basically, as I understand it. And I know very

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.120
as much as anyone would know when they haven't started a job yet, my job is to go and figure

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.320
out quality strategy for those things, how do they work together, how do they build that

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.240
same culture, how do you get some consolidation among those things, which are all things I think

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.760
I'm very good at. So we'll find out. Yeah. And I always thought that

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.840
my kids are in sixth and seventh grade. My thought was after they finish high school,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.520
my thought has been for years that I would do some consulting. And I've always thought it would

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.520
be better to I would be better as a consultant to have someone besides Microsoft and Mideast off

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.920
22 years ago on my resume. So I thought it was a good time to change and get at least one other

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.600
company under my resume into my backlog and show that I can do what Alan does some place

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:53.280
besides Microsoft. So are you viewing this? So let's think through sort of the pros and cons list,

00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:05.330
like questions that I would have is would been your Microsoft team. How may they have sweetened

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:13.040
the pot such that you would have changed your decision? Remind me to get back to big

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.160
thing number two and ever got to. That's a good question. Yeah. When I and I'll be honest here

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:25.280
and some unity folks may hear this or Microsoft people, but when I was seriously considering unity,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.760
I thought, well, this is a sweet enough deal that maybe I'll just tell Microsoft about this.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.840
Which I did. I told my boss and gave him the offer details. And I thought this would be good

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:43.840
because maybe I'll get a little retention money or something. Or maybe it's a thought like it was

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.440
a monetary thing at the time. But I'll get a little bit of money from my car. I use this to

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.240
look some more money out of Microsoft. They got deep pockets. But after as soon as I told him

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.880
and started the ball rolling of me thinking of actually leaving, I didn't care about the money

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.720
anymore. I didn't want the pot sweetened for me and Brett and I have both made fun of Microsoft

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.860
a little bit in the past, maybe quite a bit. But it's it's been a fun company to work at.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.300
And it's been great to see the changes they made, especially in the last few years.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:20.670
But they're just not a company moving at a pace that can keep up with me. At least in the

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:25.870
groups that I've been in. It's and in my and I'll put this out there bluntly. And I would tell

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.950
everyone from Satya down to my lowest level direct report this.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:38.910
I think that Microsoft is bogged down by too many people in who have been here 20 years in

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.990
these leadership positions that don't know what to do with. I was talking to someone in Windows

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:49.040
yesterday and it was interesting to hear him. We got off on this tangent as we do when you

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.120
talk with someone like me. And he talked about how that org was doing a bunch of reorgs

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.980
and they had hundreds of managers. They don't know what to do with.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.180
Because they've been managers for a long time and they're not. They can't be ICs anymore.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.700
So what they what they do is they create this massive org structure of of a director with

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.300
three managers and each of them have three managers reporting to them and those three

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.500
managers have three leads each those three leads have three ICs. And they're doing that

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.580
because they're afraid to get those people to either learn to be an IC or move on or do something

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.300
else with them. So we have all this overhead and this baggage at the company. And when does

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.940
this the worst example. It's human nature. And that's those things that happen when you have a

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:44.180
company with 40,000 engineers and 150,000 people. But with that baggage you can't move quickly.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:53.300
I think as as one of those managers who have been at the company for the last 20 years.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.700
But the different I'm going to preface that by saying the differences with you is that

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:04.940
you actually pay attention to the world. There are half conservatively half of our

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:12.220
senior principal plus managers at Microsoft have paid no attention to anything but Microsoft

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:19.260
and there you you could get a job anywhere in the industry if you wanted no problem at your equal

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:27.260
or more pay. I would say half or more of our principal plus managers cannot. Yeah. And I say

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:33.020
are now by the time we publish this it will be there. The way you see me lay into Microsoft

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:42.740
after I leave. Yeah. Damn Windows 10 piece of crap. Actually I would say that now. Never mind.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:50.020
Yeah don't get me fired down. Oh while I while I could get a job other places

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:59.620
right now I'm in the the best job I've ever had. And but anyway. And that's great.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:05.220
And I was learning what I wanted to say. You know you know that you are different than the other.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:13.540
I do. The way I would phrase it is that there is a glut of high paid leadership of this company

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:24.580
that are on defense. Absolutely not it on offense. It it burns who I am. I think I've mentioned this

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:31.780
before on the podcast. Shot time. I did my Myers Briggs test like the long form test

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:39.860
years and years ago and it's like a horoscope a little bit. But it does describe who I am enough

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.980
as long as you take those tests with a grain of salt. I like them. But one thing I liked about my

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:52.500
type INTP says that I abhor inefficiency and I do. That's my type as well. And so when I see

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:59.700
these things they just grind at who I am when I see inefficiencies it burns at me. I want to be

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:06.450
efficient. So I wrote a blog. I hate waste. I wrote a good a good practitioner of lean

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:11.570
is that I despise waste. I want to grind it up and destroy it. Yes I hate waste as well but

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.010
productivity and efficiency are different things and I actually look at this from a

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:26.530
productivity point of view. I'm like oh my god that guy who is busily trying to keep alive 1996

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:37.310
development practices gets paid the same amount as three new college hires who I could eke out

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:49.140
right now two times their ROI of what they cost from their salary versus this one guy

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.500
who is probably not producing ROI. And if you look at the partner level guys it's

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:06.530
5x. Yeah there's a phenomenon every time nowadays and I think it's human nature. I think

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:14.900
you've probably done this the last three partner announces you've read. You've sort of done your

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:21.900
own judgment of okay is the company getting ROI out of this. Is this the right call. And for me

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:29.100
the last three that I've noticed absolutely not. It was it was political. Same with me.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:39.180
Also to be fair classifying it as political is is easy to do because there's a lot of the details

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:46.500
a lot of the facts that I'm not observing and different business leaders the people making the

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.670
call to promote the person to partner. They have a right to run the business as they see fit.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:31:00.590
And if that's the style that they think is the right ROI great. This is one of the things that

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:06.350
pushes me further into data science because they're just like that's all subjective intuition crap.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:13.460
We can do better than this going back to so there was nothing that could have sweetened the pot.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.940
Like you said money wasn't the issue. Money wasn't the issue then I realized. Which we know

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:27.060
from pink and other sources right. Once you get to once you get to a certain level

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:34.180
with money where you're you're you're able to block the fear threshold right. Hey I make enough

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.140
money that if I got fired I wouldn't be scared. It wouldn't be necessarily life of death thing.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:46.740
Then your motivation shifts to something entirely different. Right and Microsoft has no way of

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:55.940
offering me the agility and lowercase a agility and freedom I have in freedom is the wrong word

00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:02.660
agility and maybe even growth that I can get at a company like unity. There was a period of time

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.580
and I know one of the reasons why I'm very happy where I'm at right now.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:14.020
There was a period of time where I changed teams and felt like every time I change teams I was

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:21.650
thinking I was moving towards the future but I was moving further in the past. I would join that team

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:28.370
and then I'd find out oh my god these guys are executing in 2002 style and I would change teams

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:35.170
and find out the next team oh my god this is 1998 what the hell. Right and so. Tired of solving the

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:42.620
same problems again and again. Not only that but going further back right. Whereas

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:49.570
unity is a smaller company right. Yeah you're gonna have you're gonna have some interesting

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:55.010
challenges I can't wait. It's gonna be new fodder for the podcast so that'll be all good.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:59.730
And I've already cleared it that it's totally okay. I think the quote from my new boss was

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:06.050
as long as I'm not throwing anyone under the bus by name it's all game very open company.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:11.570
So you can throw them under the bus by title. Maybe I don't know. Like my boss. Well I don't

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:18.290
know. I had some good long talks with a few of their VPs and they seem seems like a good company.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:25.010
I'm excited. Should be fun. But no Microsoft it just once I got past the money thing it's like

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:29.810
oh my god why am I staying here anymore. It was time for me to move and which is crazy. I've

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.210
been here a long time. A little bit of golden handcuffs in place. I will lose some money

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:41.010
changing but I it was freeing to finally make it was like hard. I'm like turmoil. I can't sleep

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:47.180
at night to make the choice. Once I finally decided it's like oh that was easy. Now that I

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:54.930
once I made the choice in my in my mind. It's like oh it's just once you make the choice.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.770
I want to do this once you make the choice. It's all about execution. It was a tipping point.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.490
Like once I finally said okay I'm gonna quit. It's like it's like oh I like the blood pressure

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:13.730
drops and like oh yeah right on. Right. So those moments you almost hope your current team

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.540
doesn't sweeten the pot because it's a big like rite of passage. I got through the decision

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:26.980
now moving forward. Like I so continuous deployment. How does Unity feel about that.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.220
Why don't you ask me in a couple weeks. Okay. Oh I would have thought. I don't know.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:40.900
Because I based on my view of somewhat of what's been driving you nuts on the current team.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:53.940
This is my view not Alan's. It has been essentially trying to drag the relative horses to the fresh

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:59.060
clean water of agile. No that's not even what's that's not even it because we're actually on that

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:05.860
path. Our services are speaking as Microsoft employee. Our team services are well on their

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.860
way to being continuous deployment. And I imagine they'll get to continuous deployment in the next

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:16.820
few months. And the front end is we just almost whacked build time in half in an effort to try

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:21.780
and make CD more possible there. So definitely the path we're going on. Nobody's against it.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.300
My current team that's their current goal is to get to continuous deployment. So all that will

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:34.020
happen with or without me. By the way you two are on a doing a world tour playing the Joshua

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:42.770
Tree. No like a flashback to college for me. Right. That's how old I am. Okay. The kids today go

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:49.170
oh you two they're an oldies band right. So anyway I said with or without you. Oh gotcha.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:55.810
So that that was the segue there. Keep up keep up. So that's not it at all. It was more abstract

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:05.100
than normal. It was really the weight of it's kind of talked about before I've been frustrated

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.260
with Microsoft for a while that the weight of middle management slows the company down

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:14.700
and there's not a strong desire to either move those people out or to get them to change.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.840
It's like oh it's good enough for moving faster. It's like when say you wanted to get to

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.020
say you have a four hour build and you want to get it to two hours and some managers we got to

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.820
get to two hours and you get there and they're happy with that. I'm not happy with that. I want

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:35.250
to get it to 10 minutes. I want to keep going. And that's the same thing with Microsoft's change.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:43.620
We like like we were changing in about a mile an hour and Satya full props to the man comes in

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:50.180
and Microsoft is now moving at 10 miles an hour making a nice wide sweeping turn. I want to do

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:57.500
60 mile an hour slalom. Yeah. So Microsoft in general that's not going to happen here ever.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:10.030
Microsoft in general is like that. Like again on my current team I am working on the future.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:18.690
I feel it every single day. I feel like once we're done with this podcast I got to go upstairs.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:26.210
I'm working on ML that I know no one has ever done before and is critical to the business

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:33.730
and it's just fun as crap. Yeah I'm not telling you to leave. Oh no no and I'm just saying

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:41.680
for me feeling like I'm building the future versus building the foundation towards building

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:46.320
the future is a critical. You want to have the three P's. You want to have people you like

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.200
working with a person you like looking for working for and a project you like working on.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.240
You love your project. Sounds like you have a great team. I know your manager. I had a great

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:02.960
project. The people were the people in the person were fine but it I mean nothing against

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:10.100
them other than they I had to drag them too much maybe but that wasn't why I quit. I quit because

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:15.140
it was time for me to do something new. All the pieces fell together which I get the big thing

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:21.490
number two which is I talked about the services and needed somebody. Well hey I can do it. I'm

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:27.250
raising my hand here for those not on the video stream. And then there is one other little twist

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:34.380
is travel much less stuff to travel. It's about one week total out of every five or six weeks.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:39.660
Mostly day trips San Francisco where the main offices with a few longer trips to other spots

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:46.060
around the world where these services are located. But the big thing is as I was talking to them

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:50.980
they said oh yeah and we also in the last year we opened the Seattle office. I said hey what.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:55.860
And in my head I immediately go OK I know where the parking right is next to my house. I can take

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.220
the bus. It'll be fun to take the bus to work. I said and while I'm thinking that I said so

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.140
where's your Seattle office. I'm thinking to my head what. Well I have to transfer buses. What do

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.540
I go. And they go oh it's in Bellevue. This is what you say when you're not from Washington.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:13.620
The Seattle office is in Bellevue. So I say we're in Bellevue. It turns out the Bellevue

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:19.700
office of unity is about six blocks from where I currently work. Sweet. Is it in building. Yeah.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:26.100
OK. So I my commute gets is basically the same as shorter by about a minute and a half each way.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:34.050
I can meet my old team halfway. We can plenty of restaurants around. We can

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:40.690
bring. I'm barely moving at all. It's kind of funny. So I'm excited. Pretty sweet. That kind of like OK.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:50.340
Don't have to move. Financial is fine. New project new fun. I'm going to do this. So that's all the

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:57.380
pieces fell into place and I'm excited and happy. So I am going to my last day at Microsoft is

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:05.220
January 20th. I'm going to take a week off and ski every day and hang out and clean up my

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.780
office at home. I think I'm going to build a new gaming PC at home while I'm during that week off.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:18.020
I just did that. It is the fastest thing I did all SSD rated. I mean it's the

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:27.620
cost me about three grand. I wasn't going to spend that much. I have I have a nice quiet

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:32.180
and tech box already. I'm going to put a new motherboard and a nice fast I7.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:41.440
Which CPU did you get with CPU. Yeah. I 7 something I don't remember. I can I can send

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:51.520
you the specs. The windows installed into in including to get into the high screen.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:41:06.780
10 minutes like the you rated SSD. I rated SSDs. That's like massive geek fast. Yeah. Well so

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.980
I think you know this before but I spent time as a middle manager in the storage group.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:21.710
So perfectly comfortable with with raid. You want to do raid striping for the

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:26.190
if you want to go on the cheap right. Otherwise if you want to do like the full blown thing where

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:32.270
you have performance and redundancy because SSDs aren't known. There were some reliability

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:40.690
that mechanical drives. But I was all about performance right. And it's just awesome.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:48.110
Although it and about a month from now because you at your feet to the the speed of the system

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.590
pretty quickly. About a month from now I'm pretty sure I'll get God damn it. This thing is so friggin

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:58.910
slow anyway. So anyway I'm one thing I on that though if you're about to do that. Have you heard

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:06.750
about the the M2 drives. Nowhere to the M2 drive. I didn't even know these thing existed except

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:12.020
when I was shopping because I always do a Frankenstein machine. Yeah. That's it. I have

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.580
an old case. So for at this point I have my machine now and I have my old machine which is

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:22.020
a super nice case until there's some like super big advancement in quiet cases because I always

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.820
try to build as quiet a PC as I can. I will just alternate my new PCs between these cases and

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:34.800
upgrade the older older ones. So an M2 is a is a drive but it's a chip that plugs directly to

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:43.020
your motherboard. So it looks like a memory module but it's a drive and it's for those who can't see

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:49.020
the video. I'm making a rectangular symbol like a memory chip on a motherboard. Right. You plug it

00:42:49.020 --> 00:43:00.740
directly in. I have a 500 gig version of these. That's where I installed my OS partition. So it

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:05.300
doesn't go through the SATA interface. It's directly on the bus. Do you connect them to one

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.180
of the RAM slots? No it's got its own slot. So I have to get a special motherboard that has a

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:16.740
special slot for this. Yes. Noted. Okay. All right. And I can send you I can say again I can send you my

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.300
stuff. I'm looking at them right now. They look just like a RAM chip. So I need to make sure I get a

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:28.370
motherboard that has one of those. I should get one of those. It is cool. All right. Let's go back

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:38.180
to the regularly scheduled podcast. Okay. So where we leave off. I'm leaving Microsoft going to

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.820
Unity. I gave some reasons why they're in Bellevue. I'm not moving which means that Brent and I can

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:51.300
still continue to meet here in Redmond to record the A.B. podcast. Continue. Yeah. So we got a few

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:59.060
minutes left. How about we wind this up to something more wisdom giving. Have you noticed

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:05.300
have you noticed a pattern for you. I'll give you some wisdom right now. Thanks.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:13.300
About how and when to change jobs. So like from my experience there is a right way and a wrong way to

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.300
to do that. Two bits of advice that I given so many times in the past that I gave myself.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.900
One I just gave the three piece people person in the project make sure there are things you want

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:30.530
to do. The other bit of advice is always go to a job never from a job for sure. So I didn't

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:34.530
want to just like and I get my job is great. I totally could have stayed and had fun and done

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:41.390
well at Microsoft in my current job just with things kind of wait out and it was a job that was

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:47.070
better for me and oftentimes for the last 22 years I've done that by moving jobs at Microsoft.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:51.790
When I moved to this team I worked on that stupid science project to make Android apps run

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:56.510
on Windows phone and I knew it would never ship and we had done all the work for this product that

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:01.630
would never ship and it worked and I was bored. I don't know if anyone has ever been on a job

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:06.830
where they're bored but I'm sure some actually many people have but I know none of the three have

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.830
because they're smart people who like learning and when you're bored you're not learning.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:17.870
I left that job for that reason. I think the reason you leave a job is different all the time

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:23.710
but for me it's where is my fastest path of learning and growth. That's the thing I want

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:29.870
to look for in a job. That's what I feel stagnated at all whether it's it could just be about technical

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:37.150
learning or leadership learning or if I am not if I can find a faster path to grow and learn

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:47.390
I'm going to go do that. It's aligned like with my two big pieces of advice when it's

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:55.710
on when it's time to think about changing jobs. Absolutely the reasons for the new job better

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:05.650
overpower the reasons why you're leaving the last job. Yeah right there are always every time we make

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:11.730
a change there's always reasons why you're going and reasons why you're leaving but you are

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:17.170
you're better suited to make sure the reasons why you're going to the new company a new team

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:23.680
whatever is more important to you than the reasons why you're leaving which is not to say though

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:33.940
sometimes you just got to leave right and certainly that should be a motivation for you to

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:44.220
find the best of available offers but there's been a practice that that I've done for several

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:53.260
years. First and foremost your team has a right your team leadership has a right to run the business

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:58.700
as they see fit they're accountable for it they're the ones making the decisions and they have to

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:04.400
live and die based off of those decisions. Now so if your business leadership and your

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:11.150
decision making process don't align right well you have two choices you leave or you try to

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:17.780
influence the business leaders decisions right and I generally tend to go towards

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:24.100
that latter but if I don't like how way things are executing now I try to influence it. Yeah

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.980
and to be clear that's not you know that no that doesn't play into why I'm leaving. No it's not but

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:33.860
I get that you can I'm trying to give generic advice on so the way I get that advice is uh

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:39.060
if you're unsatisfied with your job you can change your manager or you can change your manager

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.200
or you can change your job. That was the second one. You said change your manager or change your

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.440
manager. Right right right. Well you can keep your manager. Welcome to the Allen world of

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.960
quotes you have to think about for a minute you can change your manager by managing them up and

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.480
getting them to change how they think about things or you can change your manager by getting a

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.920
different manager. Gotcha. The fact that I have to explain this just bug is one of the it's

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:14.380
why I'm quitting damn it. I've had a joke over the last week just the last couple days on my team

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:21.100
now where I'm in meetings and some it's something will happen like some weird comment or somebody

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:25.660
says and we're not sure why this life side issue happened or whatever they go I go that's why I'm

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:39.330
quitting. No that's why no that's why. My own little personal short-lived meme. Yeah so on on that one

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:51.180
like I am attracted to broken things. I love me yeah I love fixing stuff. I'm best with broken things.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:57.660
Yes and I'm creative and I'm persistent and so one of the things that hits me hard

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:04.620
is when I when I try to fix something and it fails I'm very

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:12.060
agile at coming up with a new approach and going after that and I could until I had learned this

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:23.380
strategy I would do that ad infinitum. All right get up go back again okay. But when I learned a

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:29.780
little bit around more this is about 10 years ago about how you run a business and how you execute

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:38.750
on a business and and how I play into that business. I learned some things you just can't

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:43.310
fix like they have a right to run the business as they see fit and if there are a strong

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:49.230
principle that they believe is critical and you realize that what you're trying to change is this

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:54.190
important belief of theirs you're probably not going to succeed unless you can come up with

00:49:54.190 --> 00:50:03.120
to prove it. So I have a policy I call it this three strikes and I'm out where I will

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:13.220
take a big risk try to influence this change in a big way and if that fails in a way that has

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:21.070
severe consequences on me that will be a strike one. It sounds like strike one two and three to me

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:31.600
but go on. No for me so and I have a whole practice on the three strikes and I'm out rule

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:38.340
right well on strike one I tell my boss that hey this is strike one strike two I don't necessarily

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:47.680
do that and strike three you you learn about strike three because I I tell you that I'm I've

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:56.140
accepted a new offer and quite honestly that that was what executed my last job change. It was was

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:04.370
not necessarily what I prefer because I'm also I view myself as sort of a technical mercenary.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:12.210
I will consider any offer at any time all right I constantly will look be looking for

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:16.210
what is a better offer. You should change your job title on LinkedIn the technical mercenary.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:27.100
Okay just saying go on technical mercenary manager man yeah whatever. But it my evaluation

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:33.340
of a better offer is inclusive like money is part of it whether or not I'm going to be

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:41.660
working towards the future or helping lay a foundation for the future as we just discussed.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:50.700
What am I going to learn is critical. How how am I going to be able to apply those learnings.

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:58.060
Like when I started my current job which now I've been in almost two years right they were

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:06.220
building a brand new data science team. I had just started my degree. I was looking for a place

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:16.350
to apply this this skill set and they took a big risk and I've gotten promoted once in that time

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:25.790
frame and I think it's mutual now that hey they made a good decision and I made a good decision.

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:29.070
We should always take risks always put yourself on the steepest learning curve.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:34.750
Another bit of advice. Not the steepest the steepest achievable. Sure sure like

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:44.430
you can you can hurt yourself by going after a stretch goal that is not within your grasp.

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:54.370
Sure now you and I at our experience level there's there's realistically there's not too many of those

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:59.170
that we couldn't achieve with the timelines that we're expected to achieve them in.

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:07.340
Perhaps perhaps right but all right we can continue that next time. Yeah we gotta get going. Okay so

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.420
we'll we'll chat again I'll probably be at unity maybe we'll chat again just before I start there

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:18.940
I'm not sure but big news and I guess that's it we'll see in episode 53. Yeah congratulations

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:25.180
by the way thank you I'm Alan I'm Brent and we'll see you next time on A-B testing.
