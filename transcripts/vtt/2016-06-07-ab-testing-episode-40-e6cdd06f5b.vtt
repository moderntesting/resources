WEBVTT

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.040
Howdy.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.120
Hey, guess what?

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.430
It's episode number 40.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.200
40.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.000
40 of 80.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.900
The big four-o.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.080
So it's a week of anniversaries, because Monday

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.330
is my 21-year anniversary at Microsoft.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.490
Congratulations.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.650
And I am not, to celebrate, I'm going to Vegas.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.730
And we talked about this last time.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.890
You're not a gambler yet.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.250
French, oh, here goes the tequila.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.750
We don't have tequila, so we'll do coffee shots

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.430
when Brent says we've talked about this before.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.810
All right, so you're not a gambler,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.050
so what's happening in Vegas?

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.930
I'm going to Vegas to talk about A-B testing,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.850
not the podcast, the actual experimentation.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.510
That's right.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.770
That's the conference this weekend.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.610
Well, it's Monday.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.410
My workshop's Monday.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.170
I'm flying down Sunday.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.450
Give them a workshop Monday, flying back Tuesday.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.570
That was it that I could announce last week,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.320
but those that follow the conference world on Twitter.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.600
Holy cow, it's going to be a fun day of Alan

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.120
not being able to talk.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.920
Every day for A-B testing, recording,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.800
I bring in two cups of coffee for me

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.700
to drink throughout the episode,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.460
and neither one have been started yet.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.560
And I think it's a problem right now.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.480
You rode your bike today, I guess?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.080
I did.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.040
Yeah, so you weren't pre-caffeinating on the way

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.660
in then.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.620
It is really hard to drink a cup of coffee on a motorcycle.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.740
First of all, balancing on the gas tank, pain in the butt,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.220
and then getting the cup in your helmet

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280
without pouring coffee all over your chin, really difficult.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.200
What about one of those football beer helmets?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.290
That is an idea that I feel just dumb for not trying.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.090
I will be in the city of brotherly love

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.040
in November, Philadelphia.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.880
Philly!

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.630
Before test bash.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.430
Oh, are you going to be bashing test?

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.270
I'm going to be talking.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.070
Sweet.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.230
I'm the one giving a talk about,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.310
I think I titled my talk,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.120
you know, I'm kind of, I mentioned this perhaps before.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.840
But I have.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.440
Oh, no, no, drink.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.800
I am evolving this talk around my experiences

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.040
with being the guy, the test and quality guy

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.320
on a team with no testers

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.960
and talking to other people with the same experiences

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.000
and learning what works and doesn't work

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.040
and watching more failures with the move

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.600
than I see success.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.360
So I'm talking about testing without testers

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.300
and other stupid things or something like that.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.380
I think we learn well from mistakes.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.660
We can watch what others have done wrong.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.000
You only learn from mistakes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.400
Oh, so and so teams tried that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.440
and they failed to have a dumb idea.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.800
I've seen that for, well, 21 years now.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.800
At Microsoft.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640
At Microsoft.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.370
So I think it's important to understand how and why

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.970
these fail and when and where they work.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.930
So you can figure out if they work in your context.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.930
So I'm giving that talk and it's,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.850
I don't like giving the same talk.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.250
So I've been evolving this talk.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.810
I can say this, I think,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.730
by the time I go to test bash,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.530
this product that I'm working on

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.250
will be publicly available or should be

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.890
or damn well should be.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.520
So it'll be interesting to talk about it in that context.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.600
Talking about a real thing in November.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.440
November, okay.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.320
So I'm pretty stoked about that.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.640
Appreciate the invitation.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.040
So conferences, we're looking at our

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.040
burn down list here on the board.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.840
So we'll dive right into the,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.250
I forget what the section's called again.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.130
Mailbag!

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.960
So Danny Fott, software optimist,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.800
asked if we knew, had any more information on the,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.000
what was going on at Yahoo.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.840
And I don't.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.120
Did you say software optimist?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.080
Software alchemist.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.920
Oh, okay.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.170
Software optimist is nobody in testing.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.530
It really should be nobody in testing.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.670
So I haven't heard anything.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.910
The one person, I used to have some good connections

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.870
in Yahoo and they've all left the company.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.310
And wow, they're all testers, that's weird.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.030
My connections to Yahoo are,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.470
god, about eight years old.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.670
Yeah, so I don't know.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.910
I use a news clip of the Yahoo,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.110
getting rid of the safety net

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.510
makes us better developers article

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.590
that came out when they made this change.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.550
But again, that's press and it's hard to tell.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.390
There could be a lot more going on under the scenes.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.030
Or there may not be.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.870
It's hard to tell.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.870
But Yahoo is getting a lot of PR on this.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.950
But they're far from the first big company

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.990
to go down this path.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.830
Oh, I know.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.110
But there was, I think he brought it up

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.670
because this is the one that got media attention about it.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.270
That Facebook has been doing this

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.110
same sort of thing for years.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.030
And Facebook-ish, the thing to remember,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.270
and this is something important

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.550
when you think about unified engineering,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.350
combined engineering, or no testers,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.550
whatever you want to call it, is that.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.950
Unified engineering.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.750
The story I bring up is when I went

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.350
to the Google Test Automation Conference in Kirkland.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.110
It's been two years, maybe three years ago now?

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.430
I can't remember.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.470
I'm old.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.470
I think it's three.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.950
Three-ish.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.070
The guy from Facebook, giving a talk comes up,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.510
swaggers up there.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.790
I work at Facebook, and we don't have testers at Facebook,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.030
like trying to get a rise,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.510
like, these are test-automators.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.180
I'm the engineering lead for a software reliability team.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.260
I roll like a dude.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.550
Whatever.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.430
We don't have testers.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.630
We have software explorers and evaluators.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.950
Right.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.550
We don't have testers.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.150
We have performance analysts.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.040
It's like, and the point is.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.440
Quality analysts.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.680
The three know that the work gets done,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.520
or the work should get done.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.720
The way you fail at this is you stop doing testing.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.080
But the activities still need to occur.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.520
And what happens in a good unified engineering team

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.800
is that they occur in a more optimized manner

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.000
than they typically do on a waterfall,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.450
or a stage, or a separated team.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.290
Yeah.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.490
Anyway, I have no insight.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.530
It's not really talking about there.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.090
But question acknowledged.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.850
Thank you.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.480
Who's Peepee?

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480
Patrick.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.320
Oh, prill.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.600
Testpappy.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.950
I only know people by their Twitter and Slack handles.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.590
Yes.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.910
But I think it probably is not too cool for us

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.430
to continue to call in Peepee on the podcast.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.030
Patrick asks, how does Microsoft grow and recruit

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.820
into quality-oriented roles?

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.180
Damn good question.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.140
Yes.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.540
I'm going to let you start, because I

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.460
have to think about my answer.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.980
The prep was low for this episode.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.060
I think this one's all about you, honestly.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:39.240
Because when Patrick is asking around quality-oriented roles,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.390
like what Alan does, I'm thinking

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.350
it's there's two versions of this in my mind.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.830
Number one, what Alan does.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.950
Number two, what Windows does.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.390
Oh.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.190
And between the two of us, there's

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.430
only one of us that has an opinion on this.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.430
OK.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.910
All right, while you were talking,

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.150
I had a chance to form some thoughts on this.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.750
So it's interesting.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.790
We should probably give some background.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:08.950
Because it's very recent.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.430
Microsoft has had a lot of Estets, testers, software

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.670
divide engineers, and test.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.510
When we made this move, I can't say we kept them all.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.470
But people moved into roles, whether development roles,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.070
some of them.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.590
Some of them did very well.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.750
Some not.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.070
People that were good test developers,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.350
they're pretty good developers.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.510
The thing I have discovered is that people

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.210
who were good test developers, for the most part,

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.360
are making themselves very well known as better developers.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.000
My experience as well.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.560
In Windows, they just decided to not have a test team,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.560
but to have a quality team.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.800
And they focus on telemetry, data science, really

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.880
business intelligence, and some of the illities.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.600
Yeah, the fact that you said business intelligence

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.110
data science, I find nearly offensive.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.150
And that's what they're focusing on.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.830
I may poke a little bit.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.490
So this is for background, where everybody went.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.840
So when I came to this role on my team,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.080
they wanted someone to think about this quality role.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.640
Think about quality and being a role,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.600
to think about quality and make sure all the activities were

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.240
being done.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.480
I mentioned a minute ago.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.880
That doesn't require a drink.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.280
I mentioned a minute ago that on a unified engineering team,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.720
all the activities, the quality and testing activities,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.960
still get done.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.000
And they wanted someone who actually knew what those were,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.120
so they could get done.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.720
And that's my role on the team.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.960
So how do we grow and recruit those people?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.160
I don't know that we do.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.310
Not every team at Microsoft has someone like me.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.710
Some do.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.510
Most don't.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.110
One of the goals for me on this team

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.290
was to show after this product ships,

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.610
and assuming it's massively successful,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.050
I'd like to show this is how a unified engine.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.650
This is the example, the template for how

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.930
a unified engineering team works.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.930
You have some specialty around quality.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.360
And this is where this is the role

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.160
that people who really get that systems thinking

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.880
of testing and quality, as you can see across the product,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.800
can have a place to fit in a unified engineering team.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.710
How do you recruit those roles, NFI?

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.040
One thing that's actually a little bit different these days

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.400
when you're recruiting from universities even external,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:41.680
it was difficult, not hard, but difficult, more difficult

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.640
to recruit for test roles than it was, SDET roles,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.800
than it was for SDE roles.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.200
And the difference being mainly the industry stigma

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.440
around the test role.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.960
I think at Microsoft, most people got here, they go, oh, wow,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.600
this is not banging on buttons.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.600
But it was hard to get over that hump.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.280
Now, since we recruit just for SDEs,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.360
but we make sure that they have some aptitude, good aptitude

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.280
for testing and quality, recruiting is actually

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:12.960
a little bit easier.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.640
But how do we find those people who are going

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.680
to grow into quality roles?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.350
I don't think you know when you recruit them.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.480
So a couple of thoughts as you were talking.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:31.360
Number one, so we have probably a more relevant expert

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.400
on the Slack channel than us on that particular question

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.870
with respect to Steve Rowe, who is in a quality

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.710
team within Windows.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.950
So I'll definitely publicly invite Steve

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.120
to address that question within the Slack channel.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.420
Everybody who isn't on the Slack channel, of course,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.380
you can still.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.100
I'll say two things.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.740
Let's do this.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.140
Let's do episode 40.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:11.300
One, I think Steve's quality team is better than most

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.740
or all the other quality teams as far as what they actually

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.500
have embraced it and figured it out from the beginning.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.920
But also, I'll go out on a limb here without consulting

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.360
with Brant and say we should maybe

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.160
have used that little input right there I'm pointing out

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.040
on our new mixer.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.000
And we could have Steve come in and talk about this himself.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.920
In fact, that would be a good topic to have.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.880
We could talk to Steve about what

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.520
is the quality role in Windows and how does that

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.280
differ from what I do here?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.920
Because I can't really speak for him.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.040
One of the things that we just talked about,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:54.080
I like your loophole here, is the Google Test Bash.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.840
And essentially, all Google did is there's still testers.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.800
They renamed is the accusation.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.480
And I will state that at a still far too big.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.200
I think you're confusing listeners.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.560
We're talking about Facebook and their software reliability.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.240
No, you talked about a, oh, I write Facebook claim.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.480
We have no testers at the Google Bash.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.960
Yes.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.320
At the Google Test Automation Conference.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:17.840
Right.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.600
The best bash is the thing I'm going to.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.400
Please, I've had coffee now.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.240
Obviously, you have not.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.160
Because you're getting your words all confused.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:25.660
OK.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.760
Thank you for adding clarification.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.280
So one accusation could be, isn't Microsoft

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.520
just doing the same thing?

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.100
And I think the correct answer is, in a large degree, yes.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.580
I think any time you, as briefly tangentatized,

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.860
any time you say Microsoft does blah,

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.220
or Microsoft, the answer is wrong, or right, or both.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.060
Because the company's too damn big.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.420
Ooh, new fallacy, listen.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.920
My point is, even though Alan and I speak

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.800
to a particular direction and push for what quality

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.240
means and should mean, even large chunks of Microsoft

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.200
isn't fully aboard on this.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.440
And I'm aware of one team that had moved to a unified

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.040
engineering model.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.050
And now they're blatantly moving back.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.710
And I think they're going to pay the price for that

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.000
from a productivity standpoint, not a political standpoint.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.520
But you brought up Steve and quality roles.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.960
Like the one thing that I do very much

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.140
like about how Steve's team's been rolling

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:52.820
is they're very deeply focused on the topic of quality

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.060
and recognize that it is not a synonym for testing,

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.380
whereas a lot of places it is.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.740
So I like your suggestion.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.380
In terms of recruit and grow, like if I were thinking

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.540
through, and there are many places where I could see

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.460
at the company and even in my organization,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.340
where we could use someone like Alan.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:25.360
The real challenge is, unlike when we were recruiting

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.880
for S-TET roles, there is no way in bloody hell

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.000
I would ever recruit someone for this role, say from campus.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.920
This is someone that you would want a crapload of experience

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.700
underneath their belt.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.580
So this is.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.860
Yeah, I think the way you do it is like right now I

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.700
have a very small team and there's

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.740
one of the guys on the team who I could see doing what I do

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.660
or growing into that role.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.660
And I think that's the way you grow them.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.980
And then there are, I mentioned on my team,

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.930
there are a lot of developers and some of them, many of them

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.970
are really good testers too.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.010
And some of them, as they grow in their career,

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:16.860
they'll figure out how the pieces fit together

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.660
and look at them with experience

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.980
to get all these quality issues.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.540
I think the person you put in this role,

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.140
not necessarily a direct testing background,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.140
but I think the thing that helps me in my role

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.060
is the fact that I've been doing this for frickin' ever.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.260
Yeah, there's a high degree of experience required.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.820
And I think the recruiting model for this role,

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:43.660
even though, so Alan a couple of years ago,

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.740
no, it was just this year, sent me a message saying,

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.380
hey, I'm looking for another person like me, who do you know?

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.140
And that was a really hard question.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.820
That was a really hard question.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:04.940
Because it is very similar to today saying, hey,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.380
I need a deep performance expert.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.380
I need a deep security expert.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:17.640
And I think that's where your role

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.800
is today.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.180
Someone needs a deep quality expert,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.140
but quality as a system function, not as necessarily

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.460
a super tester.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.700
I think we'll see as time marches on

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:41.070
that we'll see a few more people in roles similar to Alan's.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:47.480
But we will then, in fact, view it as a specialist role.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.240
I think so.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.760
Something I was going to say, oh, which reminds me,

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.340
I have, if you know anybody, I'll ask right here,

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.660
so the three can know over here in case they know anybody.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.380
I'm happy to have someone external.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.780
But my team owns everything from the moment

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.780
the code is checked in until it gets deployed

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.620
to our production servers.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.980
We deployed to 12 servers now.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.080
We're in data centers around the world.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.880
You are the code factory head.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.680
The crank of things.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.480
And in between there, of course,

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.320
between the code checked in and going to production,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.080
there's a lot of quality stuff that happens.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.640
So the four of us own all that.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.920
And it's not enough because with scaling,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.920
we need help with mainly on the DevOps side,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.840
Azure management, scripting, getting builds together.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.800
So if you know anybody.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.000
I know a lot of people on DevOps side.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.760
OK, if you know anybody who's like an independent worker,

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.040
can just look at ambiguous instructions

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.160
and figure out what to do and get crap done,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.000
send them my way.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.400
The challenge is who's looking.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.960
Same for the three.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.000
If you know anybody, send them my way.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.240
You know, I get ahold of me.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.520
We're underwater.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.880
I tell my team, we're like a car crash away

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:12.300
from being like setting our schedule back like two months.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.620
We're a little bottleneck.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:19.880
I don't like on a team when one person has all the knowledge.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.560
It's a bad situation.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.120
Yeah, that's a scary situation.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.480
It's one of the things that is interesting.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:33.790
So as you know, I've been running Agile teams for a long time.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.310
All of my reports have been I've been sort of training

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.610
and guiding them for a better part of the last three years.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.580
And now when it comes to knowledge sharing,

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:53.220
they are like in my office want to talk about it at a 101

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.060
irritated when knowledge sharing isn't occurring.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.700
I don't know if we really answered that,

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.780
but we talked about it.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:05.300
Yeah, so far two questions down and both answers are,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.890
we don't know.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.570
You know, you think for a nice even-numbered episode like

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.650
40 would be awesome and not like wishy washy lame.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.850
Right, and the positive thing is, look,

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.530
we're already halfway done.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.210
Great.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.250
Well, actually, it won't look that way after I edit.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.210
Oh, I see.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:22.730
I see.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.890
So even the word, so let me just say this right now.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.010
As you're listening to the AB podcast,

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.890
I want to consider what you've paid for it

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.250
and you get what you pay for.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.090
Actually, you don't even get that much because you've

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.220
paid with your time already.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.300
Yeah, that.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.060
And hopefully there is a reason we have three listeners.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.100
Hopefully editing has made your lives a little bit better

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.620
than it would have been if you're actually

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.740
in the room with us.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.580
Oh.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:50.740
Completely random, like more random than random.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.620
What is more random than random?

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.460
Now as a mathematician, we realize how stupid that is.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.700
This is more random.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.020
So we do tangents.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.580
This then would be a random tangent,

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.580
which is not redundant.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.980
This is like inception.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.220
So I.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.180
Tangent to inception.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.180
I was quickly reminded that we have three listeners

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.900
which connected the dots of the fact that today's June 3rd.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.100
Which.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.140
Which means what?

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.660
Today is National Donut Day.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.380
Holy.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.740
Rollin' O's.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.940
That's right.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.780
B man.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.980
I have to remember this.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.260
Before I leave, because you have my favorite donut shop

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.100
right in this building.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.380
One thing about donuts is we have a frost donut shop

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.580
right on our first floor.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.800
Yes, I'll be spending 50,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.680
50 friggin dollars for two dozen.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.080
Yeah, they're.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.240
But they're worth it in my mind.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.720
I should buy some for our team.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.600
I'll go down with you.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.760
All right.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.180
OK.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.020
Next question.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.140
Shall we continue?

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.060
And who's this one from?

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.740
Really?

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.390
Danny.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.230
Brent writes like this cryptic shorthand on the whiteboard.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.710
Yeah, it's it's Danny's initials.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.910
Oh.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.710
Tough algorithm there.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.270
I only know people buy their internet handles.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.230
So software alchemist, Danny Faught,

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.530
asks about what's the best way to communicate about?

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.010
Brent, do you write English?

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.970
It's English your first language.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.010
What's the best way to communicate

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.810
about testing the emergent properties of a system?

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.810
Oh, you just left out a few letters.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.080
Yes.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.420
Got it.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.140
Oh, so this is about non-functional testing.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.940
Yeah, what he calls para-functional.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.740
Chem Kater calls para-functional testing,

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.780
which I think it he asked why it didn't catch on.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.820
I think it didn't catch on because it's a weird frickin'

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.620
name.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.500
Absolutely.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.860
I think non-functional is also kind of a weird frickin' name.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.890
I just refer to him as the Illities.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:58.410
Yeah.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.410
And that's I've used non-functional,

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.770
if I'm in a group of people, that's sort of language

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:06.210
they expect to hear.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.410
But usually I just call them Illities.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.690
And then I list a bunch that don't end in Illity

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.580
just to add more confusion.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.100
Stress.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.100
Yeah.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.460
The Illities, you know, like.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.620
Stress-ility.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.820
That's how we fix it.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.220
We just make up new words.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.980
The Illities, like performance.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.480
Illity.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:21.980
Security.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.540
Illi.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.340
Security.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.210
Yeah.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.930
That's a tough one to say.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.730
If chem can make up para-functional,

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:35.680
why not secure-ility?

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.440
Are you going to talk about this question?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.120
Well, I actually read what Danny wrote,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.080
so I can figure out how to answer it.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.720
That's somebody.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.520
OK.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.740
The best way to communicate.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.340
So I have a problem when I see the word best,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.900
because I don't ever believe there's such a thing.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:24:00.550
There's always a better way to do something.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:06.110
I'll talk about a story that I had just two days ago,

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:12.960
where we have this one team that's essentially

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.980
our DevOps team.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.770
And they're operating off of what I view

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:29.140
is the dysfunctional equation that all of these teams do.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.860
The first time, if you have a team that

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.900
is with a mission of something that's a broad scope,

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.800
and in our case, it's division scope,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.120
and their job is to sort of cat herd, amongst other things,

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:51.460
their job is to cat herd the illates across all of the vision.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:56.060
And what is the way that everyone does this?

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.780
V teams.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.180
Yes and no.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.500
But if I were to torture you longer,

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.860
I know you'd get to this.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.100
The way everyone solves this is yes, with a V team.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.420
But a V team that does what?

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.740
Of course, Alan, you're correct.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.900
Produce a scorecard.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.400
Boo.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.200
Right.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:26.480
So the discussion at hand was integration scenarios.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.520
So I'm in Azure.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:35.130
So an example would be creating a VM, deleting a VM,

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.300
launching an app service.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.140
And performance comes up, which is a Iliity.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.380
Perform-i-lity.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.100
Yep.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.260
You've pronounced that correctly.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.260
Thank you.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:56.960
And the typical way people do this is they put the scenario,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:03.280
and then they put P95, or in this case, it was P95 or P99.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.240
Those who don't understand what that means,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.120
it's the 95th or 99th percentile of their performance.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:18.160
It essentially means 99% of all transactions

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.360
were equal to or below this value.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.660
And you do that because, in general, average is stupid.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.580
Average is stupid.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.470
But I pushed back and said 99 is also stupid.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.270
I'm curious to hear why.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.430
So the way that I have found the best way

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.190
to communicate in terms of performance

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.220
is by showing the distribution.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.740
So generally, the distribution will

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.300
be a head-tail curve on almost every performance situation.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.940
Agree?

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.900
Now, so if you go with 99th, then

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:03.980
you are including a large portion of the outliers.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.550
By looking at the distribution, you can now decide, OK,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.910
what's more important?

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.710
Pulling down the outliers or improving the experience

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.810
for the head.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:23.530
So if you find that the head of the distribution, again,

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:31.960
a head-tail curve, if you find that 90% of that head-tail

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.240
curve is in the head, then you're

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.120
going to be better suited ignoring the outliers

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.750
and focusing on how do we make that 90% faster.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.790
OK, thanks.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.270
So this is one of those things where

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:55.480
P99 forces you to collapse it all into one experience.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:01.310
And I'll introduce what I call the 80-80 rule.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:05.880
It's not my rule, but I do share it.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:13.820
80-80 rule is 80% of the value costs 80% of the effort.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.740
But the other 20% of the value costs an additional 80%

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.220
of effort.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.100
Yep, makes sense.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:27.860
And so if you are looking, in my view, you look at these things

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.140
and you look at it as a system.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.940
You look at it in terms of business value or customer

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.020
value, and then you break it down in Pareto order.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:41.540
You want to not just have an overly simple, stupid system

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:49.120
that potentially wastes money on outliers.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.780
Have you had enough time to think about?

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.900
Yeah, because that's very interesting.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.420
Not sure to answer this question.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.860
So I said a boo when you mentioned scorecards.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:05.700
But often, depending on how you put it, how you build it,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.340
scorecards can be the right solution.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.500
Because people like to watch things that are red, turn

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.860
green.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:17.930
And the thing to be careful of is driving the wrong behavior.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.970
So this got brought up in the thread.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:28.770
So the best way to communicate about these things, I think,

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:32.080
is the same as the best way to communicate anything.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.080
So a scorecard.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.400
I do like scorecards.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.160
I don't like red, yellow, green scorecards.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.560
It said good, bad, or on track.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.960
Because the problem is, those type of scorecards,

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.760
you need to be able to look at something

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.520
if you're trying to communicate.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.440
So let's view this.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.440
You have this knowledge, and you're communicating outwards.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.360
So the readers of this are your customers, of your output.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:09.560
Your customers must be able to clearly understand what actions

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.970
need to be taken without questioning you.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:18.250
And these red, yellow, green scorecards, don't do that.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.570
I agree.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.970
I had an angry moment a month or so ago.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:25.730
I run our ship room.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.570
And we had one of our, so the way

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.330
I took care of making sure our ILLITIES were handled

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.730
across the team with no testers is I put one of my peer

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.480
engineering managers in charge of every ILLITY I cared about.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.870
So the engineering manager in charge of one of the ILLITIES

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:47.030
for the second week in a row showed this huge mass of red,

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:47.830
yellow, green.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.350
And all I said was, everybody's working hard.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.350
We're making some progress.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.870
It's hard to tell from here, but everybody's working hard.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.240
And there's useless.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.880
You may as well show me a picture of a unicorn taking

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.440
a crap in the forest.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.720
It would have been as useful.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:12.240
Did you see the unicorn rainbow snippet at the end of Deadpool?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.280
That cracks me up.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.960
So anyway, the feedback to him was,

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.160
what does the team need to know about where this area is?

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.600
What are the action items?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.800
What needs to be done?

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.360
What are the risks?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.240
What are the goals?

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:29.960
Whatever.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.920
Something around those areas versus a mass

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.880
of red, yellow, green.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.880
So it was going back to your point,

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.840
there was nothing on there actionable.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.440
There was nothing on there I could read and go, oh,

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.040
this is good.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:42.520
This is bad.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.680
It was just too hard to figure out.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:51.550
If you have a scorecard, it should be painfully obvious

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.270
what it's telling you and what it means,

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.110
whether there's action to take, whether there's

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.510
risk to worry about that needs to be mitigated,

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.790
or whether it's truly on track and nothing

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.150
to worry about at all.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.990
But if those things are missing,

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.160
the scorecard becomes useless.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.240
There's, to piggyback on that, the other problem

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.610
with these scorecards is what's the goal?

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.810
And oftentimes, like, say, with performance, oh,

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:27.340
the goal is to bring P99 down to 200 milliseconds.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:32.740
No, that's not a goal.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.060
That is a stake in the ground, a target.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.460
Yes, something along those lines.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.800
The goal, in my mind, needs to be something that says,

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.360
this is the business benefit.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.510
When I try to communicate these type of things,

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.710
generally what I try to do is I look at it, I analyze it,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.140
and then I break chunks down into sort of Pareto order

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.300
of benefit to customers.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.830
A lot of these things, you can just do ad infinitum.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.670
Great, we have everything all green.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.630
This is what we agreed to.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:16.070
However, a customer still hates the product.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.390
So great, we all agreed to.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.350
We can all pat ourselves on the back

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:26.030
that we did the best we could, I guess.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.910
But in my view, it's because you're

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:28.910
targeting the wrong goal.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.750
You're targeting the goal of, I actually

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.390
had this conversation with an employee this week.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.830
It's like, look, you learning to drive

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.600
is an uninteresting goal.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.690
What's an interesting goal is we're

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.820
doing a road trip to Vegas.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.620
And you're going to learn to drive in order for us

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.100
to execute on that road trip to Vegas.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.940
So you hit on something, a nerve that really,

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.850
where I agree with you, really hard.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:02.770
Because I think teams can often

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.090
focus on doing really good engineering.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:09.610
We're going to put some targets and we're going to hit those.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.050
And we're going to make sure that we can do this.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.010
Our test is going to run.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.970
Our meantime to failure test is going to run.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.970
And we're going to make sure we get all this.

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:20.970
And they focus so much on just doing the engineering work,

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:23.530
they forget to make a product that customers like.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.010
Execution is really important.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.370
But executing in a valuable direction

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.570
is also really important.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.930
And I find that these engineering teams that

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:40.850
are so deeply focused on progressing on execution

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:45.370
are often it's the age old trees versus forest discussion.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.210
Right there they're inside the forest.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.170
So like, oh, neat tree.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.850
Let's do the one to the left now.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:51.330
Yeah.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.050
And going back to my role, that's

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.260
my part of my role on the team is

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.220
to make sure that the guys working on performance

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.460
aren't just, it's not hard work.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.300
I go, so what's the user benefit

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.280
of getting to this goal?

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.320
And make sure there's answers for those questions.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.320
So the answer I think so far that we've brainstormed through

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:21.930
is number one, communicate in a way that makes actionability

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.380
readily apparent.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.620
Communicate in a way that discusses the system

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.380
in business terms.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.860
And I would, there's with any change,

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.300
and a change can be an organizational change,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.140
or a change can be an improvement in engineering.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.020
One thing like I have said a million times before,

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.580
when you move to agile, if you make a big organizational

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:53.260
change, explaining why, like we want to be able to ship daily.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.580
So in order to do that, we're going

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.380
to combine our engineering teams,

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.380
we're going to agile methods, blah, blah, whatever

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.540
you want to explain that.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.940
Versus people go, oh, we want to ship every day.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.300
This is the goal.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.380
And to do that, we have a bunch of other stuff

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:06.940
we're going to do.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.800
We're going to learn to drive.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.320
Versus what happens to a lot of teams,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.560
is like, hey, tomorrow you're all engineers.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.960
We'll figure out what that means later.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.400
It's like, the what?

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.480
So let's trench that over here.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.640
We need to get performance better.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.720
All right, let's work on performance.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.240
Versus our customers are complaining about performance.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.690
By June 30, we want them to be bragging

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:34.550
about the performance of our app over our competitors.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.470
Maybe not the best goal.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.710
I would love to see someone brag about that.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.870
So we want to improve the user experience around performance.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:45.350
We want to make sure people feel

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:50.630
that the product is snappy, whatever.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.430
Because we think this will sell a million more units.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.710
So why you're working on performance, why that's a target.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:03.710
Yet, Amazon did this very, at least to me now,

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:07.310
very famous experiment, where they basically,

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:14.460
their landing page, they put a configurable sleep

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.180
in the loading of the page.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:22.620
And they ran a series of experiments, A-B testing,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.820
to be discussed by Alan Page in Vegas at a place near you,

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:36.110
as long as it's in Vegas, where they artificially slowed down

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.380
the render of their page.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:44.280
And they tracked the abandonment rate of the customers.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.360
So long story short, they were able to determine two things

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.160
that are critical.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.190
Number one, how much a millisecond

00:37:54.190 --> 00:38:01.960
on their landing page is worth, and where, what's

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.480
done in economics terms, marginal utility, where

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.720
that utility dies off.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:16.410
Where it's no longer useful to eke out that extra millisecond.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.360
Because if they had a 10-second rendering page,

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.320
going from 10 seconds to 5 seconds

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.220
is going to keep way more customers.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:31.600
But if you're already at 400 milliseconds,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.220
cutting that in half to 200 milliseconds

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.460
saves you not as many customers.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.200
It is not a linear curve by any means.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.540
OK.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.300
You went off on a tangent there, but did we finish the topic?

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.540
No, so I'll wind back to the performance thing.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.540
And then this will be my coup de gras on this topic.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:04.960
On the P95 and the P99, if you understand how stats work,

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.480
and again, if you guys remember what I just

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.000
said around the distribution and it being a head tail curve,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.120
basically I communicated to them,

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:21.160
because I have found that a lot of business leaders

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.160
don't understand or appreciate data science lingo.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.960
And I basically have shared with them,

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.400
look, if you want to have, let's say,

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.540
P95 as your one metric that matters for performance,

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.640
then if you want one metric that matters, is what I said,

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.600
is you need to be clear then on what you're focusing on.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.280
Are you trying to reduce the variance of customer

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.070
experience, meaning what's the likelihood

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:58.020
of outliers happening?

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:04.080
Or are you trying to improve customer satisfaction rates?

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.000
Because these are opposite things.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.640
And right now, your metric is going

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.890
to focus you on removing outliers from the system, which

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:18.410
I'm sure it's just code, it's not magic.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.050
We'll get there.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.570
But at the end of the day, if you're

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.370
expecting higher customer satisfaction rates,

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.130
I don't believe you'll get there.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.930
Now, if you're expecting, say, a reduction what's

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.570
known as customer calls on CSS, yeah, you'll probably

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.330
get a reduction in customer calls,

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:39.050
because the customers who we really, the two or three

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:42.350
that we really tanked, they're going to be upset.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:47.560
But that's not going to have a big impact on customer

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.770
satisfaction rates overall.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.250
So you guys have to decide.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.570
And in that case, I told them, there's

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.970
two metrics that I think are better,

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.490
one's known as the coefficient of variation.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:06.940
That's much better at focusing on reducing

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.740
the variance of the experience.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.980
How do we reduce some people having super fast,

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.740
and some people take 10 days for a thing to render?

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:25.230
And then median, I find, is a much better stat than P95.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.220
All right, cool.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.740
Hopefully that rambled around, and some sort

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.740
of answer to the question.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:31.220
Yes.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.340
We're generating more mail-back items.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.320
One more.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.170
Hey, Alan.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.300
Here's a topic for your A-B testing show.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.380
Our product has been rolling out more and more users

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.700
over the last few months.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.620
Our CEO has decided that he does not

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.450
want to roll out to more users,

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.370
because we're hearing the exact same feedback,

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.290
or very similar feedback, from everyone

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.210
we've rolled out to so far.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.330
My thoughts are that this is good,

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.090
because we're not finding more issues.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.330
But I'm fighting against management

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.250
to try and push out our product to more users,

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.290
even before we fix these issues that are known.

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.900
What would you do?

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.270
So the feedback.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.950
So it sounds like, to paraphrase,

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.870
the product is, there's a core set of issues.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.950
We know that A, B, and C need to be fixed.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.110
And we go to more people, and they tell us the same thing.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.030
A, B, C need to be fixed.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.190
Should we go to even more people

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.190
to hear those same things?

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.910
Or should we go to more people?

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.310
Or should we fix those things first,

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.990
before we go to more people, so we can get more data?

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.710
Do you think you could get more data

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:42.830
by going to wider customers?

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.710
Do you think you could find out about DE and F?

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.790
Or are you blocked on finding out about DE and F

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.590
until you get more people on there?

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.950
There's a balance here.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:54.030
So one is, hey, we know about this feedback.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.550
I presume work is in flight.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:05.030
So the errors, how shall we hypothesize

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:12.880
on the president's feedback with respect to the customer?

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:20.340
Do we think the customer feedback is critical to the business?

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.860
Or do we think it's, hey, it's a couple of one-off bugs,

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.060
like, hey, this button's in the wrong place?

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.140
I think more fun.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.860
It sounds like it's more fundamental things,

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.700
not necessarily button in the wrong place.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.220
But a feature that would make the product more usable

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.700
is missing.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:40.570
But it doesn't sound like it's a showstopper.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.370
OK, I just thought of it another way.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.850
So the question really is how I feel.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:47.330
The feedback we have to date.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:53.320
So this, I think, is probably the best current answer

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.920
in my head.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:44:01.330
The feedback from the customers that exist today,

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:07.000
to what degree do we believe it is causing abandonment?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.680
If we think it is not causing abandonment

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.800
and it's really more around taking something that's

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.020
good and making it delightful, then, yeah,

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.980
I would turn the crank another order of magnitude,

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.980
but only another order of magnitude.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.380
So that's actually a good way to put that.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.180
What are some good ways to measure,

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.860
I guess you could just look at usage.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.860
I'm trying to think how to measure abandonment.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.380
But it's how you can look at active users

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.640
and figure that out.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.760
On a web app, one of the better ways

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:46.760
of measuring active users in this case for abandonment

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:56.070
is essentially the frequency and the,

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.190
they call it frequency and recency.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.950
So how often do they engage with the product?

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.950
And how often do they re-engage with the product?

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:09.480
So you want to look at, you would

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.720
want to start tracking new users to the product

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.560
and then look at what are the typical rates,

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.950
how frequently did they come back to the product,

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.070
and then how many re-engagement sessions generally

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:31.750
do we see before that starts to slow down.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.430
How do you correlate those A, B, and C features

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:37.950
that are missing with abandonment?

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.550
You can measure abandonment and you

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.190
can look at customer feedback to see

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.750
what they think is missing.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:44.510
But how do you correlate the two?

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:50.640
The easiest way is to put a feedback app on the product.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.080
So here at Microsoft, the most famous one

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.240
is we call Send a Smile.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.120
Send a Smile.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.120
And it sounds like they have something like that

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.720
because they're getting customer feedback.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.110
Right, but now if you track what's

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:12.250
known as active, engaged, and then disengaging customers,

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.010
that's really what I describe there.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:21.060
So looking at new users, then, and you light up the Send

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:26.260
a Smile, then you can, most people

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.330
when they instrument, you're able to see

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:36.410
the sessions of the persons who have contributed feedback.

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:40.000
And then you can say, OK, is there anything

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.240
interesting in the session?

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.760
In particular, you can look at the specific paths

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:55.480
under question and say, hey, you know what?

00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:02.680
The specific paths under question, these guys

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.840
aren't abandoning with respect to, or in comparison,

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.240
to say this other category of folks

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.080
or not even abandoning at all.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.560
What you're trying to draw a connection to

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.960
is does this group that requires this,

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.440
what's the size of that group, and how

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.080
does it differ from the ambient abandonment

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.880
rate of your product that you're already an expert on?

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.240
Because that is just pure A-B testing right there.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.000
Very cool.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.960
All right, we are out of time for episode 40.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.600
Yes, mailbag only.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.880
Our second all-mailbag episode, we did one before a while back.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.920
Percy will know the number because he memorizes them,

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.000
I think.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.800
Yeah, actually, have you seen them?

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.200
I really like what Percy did on episode 39.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.500
Oh my god, yeah, he did the live play-by-play.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.540
I had to go listen to get it.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.780
At 4302, I agree with you.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.820
At 4323, I don't.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.540
Yeah, I was like, what are you talking about?

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.420
Oh, yeah, he's right.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:12.880
All right.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.760
Later.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.880
Hasta la vista.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.480
I'm Alan.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:15.980
I'm Brent.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:16.480
Bye.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.800
Bye.
