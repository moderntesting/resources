Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.130
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hello again everybody

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.530
howdy Wow that's gonna spike the levels out loud hey a lot of things going on

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.850
it's the holiday time of the year it's episode 113 we're recording on Friday

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:45.470
the 13th and it's our last show of 2019 that's a different different song for

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.980
Friday the 13th so where was I before you derailed me I said you said it was

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.580
Friday the 13th and I said oh is it yes yes and I'm happy because if you've

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.060
heard me bitch in the past we talked about these year-end episodes I don't

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:12.780
like this 2010 2011 was 2010 2011 2012 and I finally with 2020 people will begin

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.040
pronouncing the year correctly I think in 1910 people didn't say what or 1917

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.440
1919 then say oh the year is 1919 and you won't have to deal with it again

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.480
until year 3000 now yes I know and I'm probably gonna live forever and no I'm

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.200
actually as we all know getting closer and closer to dying but that's what

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.480
happens I aren't we all yes and I'm closer to death now because I lost a

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.400
couple years of my life in blood pressure wrecking my heart last night

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.900
screaming at my computer while watching the impeachment hearings that was a

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:08.180
mistake I sure wish I could get that time back someday sigh so as we do every

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.220
actually you know what's gonna happen here in a minute I'll explain it for the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.180
new listeners the new listener man there was a bunch of stuff I was gonna

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.140
mention I thought of on the way in here that I forgotten so I'll just say hey

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.530
Brent what's new with you uh we'll probably get into it when we get

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.280
further into the episode alrighty needless to say this is shaping up to be

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:42.580
one of the best I'll call it fiscal years I've ever had we have we've done well my

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.590
org new one nice done well well throwing numbers out there because that would get

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.790
me fired and I like the job not gonna not ready to get fired yet hey speaking

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.110
of which you recently sent out a text about your new manager blaming you for

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.830
he's not my new manager I've had him for eight months and he took a while for me

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.150
to get to know and he's still a little hard to read but I'm slowly getting the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.220
like I just do what I want it's autonomous Alan a yeah and I which is

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.980
funny cuz another in response to this I'll go backward into this one of our

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.380
one of our listeners said which we're thinking of Alan having a boss but sure

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.300
I guess so but yeah I have it's funny you mentioned that because you're in my head

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.720
because I what are you laughing at I'm just wondering if I'm wearing clothes oh

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.060
my god please save me it's not a good place if you're in Alan's head anything

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.660
could happen yeah no you're straightjacket I need to wash my my brain

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.440
out with the soap gross okay so anyway I for the last as long as I can remember

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.490
my career I kind of do what I want and I'm very good at that not meaning I'm

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.890
good at doing what I want because everyone's good at doing what they want

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.090
I am good and lucky at choosing things that make a difference and he's also

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.320
very good at showing that allowing him the autonomy will create business value

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.280
and that's just not for me that's a culture thing and also when you're an

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.440
exec leader you don't want to spend a lot of time in fact I'll put it this way

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.600
if you're an exec leader you shouldn't have to spend any of your time telling

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.760
people what to do you can nudge him in a direction which he has done from time

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.800
to time but which he did with this complaint he gave me which which will

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.880
now back into I put this on our rants channel on one of the three dot slack

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.520
calm if you want to invite you can go to modern testing org there is a link

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.840
there you can come join the fun and I am trying hard not to go into tangent

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.160
inception anyway I did a rant it was more of a humble brag rant and I'll admit

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.880
that I said my boss is blaming me for all of our quality improvements yeah

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.380
that that and hard to part I don't think so I don't think so what it means

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.740
is we've massively increased our velocity decreased our number of

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.020
incidents and decreased the revenue lost from those interest in incidents all

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:36.260
while greatly a big number increasing our revenue over the year okay and I

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:43.700
tried to tell you should feel bad for you he'd been blamed is not necessarily

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.700
mean bad I don't understand why is it so difficult to parse for you it's

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.620
blame so I it was it was it was a written format I can't tell if you're

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:05.020
being sarcastic I do you read things very often is this I think you can do it's a

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.780
skill I'm developing the idea is are all these things are happening and I

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.220
say and and because it's me and I do everything I do is small micro coaching

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.300
adjustments and nudges here and there and a little bit of organizing and

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.780
asking lots of good questions here and there so I said I'm not sure how much of

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.340
this blame I can take and he convinced me how much of how much of this is due to

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.100
things I've done and he convinced me whether I believe him or not this is

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.740
where the blame comes in he says no Alan you did this okay great so that's part

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.860
one that's part one of my rant the second part is and okay so I get it

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:51.800
for Brent who is dance really really you know what I've been bored for a hundred

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.400
thirty episodes give me a break actually no a DD trigger I'm moving on actually a

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.520
hundred and eleven episodes because thank God you weren't on one that yeah

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:14.440
113 minus yeah this is the 113th yeah I fixed the math that the the I fixed the

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:24.560
error in my head anyway everyone every six billion people in the world oh yeah

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.360
I know what he means it's a for Brent going it was a good thing he likes

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.640
what's happening in quality wants me to put together a presentation explain

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.720
sort of what we did so you got to do a brag deck for your CEO yes it's more

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.840
than a brag deck it's also explaining because we're gonna expand a lot and

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.120
this is a good concern and what I'm willing and happy to take on which is

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.520
if we're going to grow the number of people in the org we've all seen this

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.560
before you add a bunch especially Microsoft when you buy a company and say

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.720
oh that's not enough people you need to double those then the company ends up

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:11.160
dying rant okay so what I need to do is try and put that in a way that shows not

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.800
only what we've done but what we've learned and what we're doing so that we

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.160
know that when we expand it's all pure acceleration and not create scale to the

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.240
CEO I was gonna say how do you make it scale that's so damn cliche that I

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.860
didn't want to everybody says and then how do you make that scale I don't

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.460
like saying I'm I'm a I'm a loner I don't like saying the things everyone else is

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.940
saying so anyway you brought it up so now we're gonna move on this is episode

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.620
113 that part doesn't matter what matters is it's the last episode are you

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.940
bored again no the last episode of 2019 and we're gonna talk about we're gonna

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.780
take some time to reflect on 2019 including the predictions we made almost

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.060
exactly one year ago and then we'll talk about what we think is gonna happen

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.840
in 2020 and then I'm going to strangle Brent tear off his neck

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.760
Travis head reattach it to his neck backward using his hair as thread and

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:14.400
then I'll go home and celebrate my happy holidays all right so Brett tellin do

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.280
you want to start with a little bit of reflection on 2019 or do predictions on

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:25.950
2019 or or interweave them together we could talk about you know the the last

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:32.590
year the last year's predictions I did not write those down did you I did heck

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:38.260
yeah awesome yeah and we were talking in the hallway on the way to this room

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:43.900
earlier and our predictions were more more of the self-fulfilling variety like

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:50.020
they're more of like goals like I'm gonna do this right but most were I am

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:56.460
not gonna do this but but some weren't and we were still remarkably accurate

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:02.740
for two old dumb guys I had them so Brent we started with yours last year and the

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.940
first one is worth worth some mentioning today which is Brent will finally decide

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:16.240
whether or not he'll graduate and not only did he make a decision as of maybe

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:24.600
a week and a half ago no Monday as of Monday I'm again old Brent has graduated

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:33.000
round of applause from the three I have completed it I don't have my piece of

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.630
paper yet that should take two weeks for someone to tell me that they're

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:44.710
gonna that I get the piece of paper and then another month before doing it

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:52.360
that semester was hell as I knew it would be it was interesting going back to

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:59.840
listening to the first episode of this year because then I was still knee deep

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.560
in sort of the the torturous decision-making process and what finally

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:15.470
pushed me over I am done I do not foresee me ever pursuing a PhD oh then

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:22.510
you can make everyone call you doctor oh for sure right I was considering making

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:29.510
you have to refer to mr. Brent Jensen MS this whole episode but then I thought

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:37.020
that was stupid you've never called me mr. Alan Page mm that's true mmm

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.740
I got I have a degree in mmm bop the song by Hansen from the 90s you know go

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:49.180
on so I'm still kind of reeling it in it this this weekend will be the first

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.940
weekend in a very long time where I don't have to come into work to do

00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:02.860
schoolwork so there's that there's that aspect of feeling that there's a big

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:13.380
gaping hole that you should be doing something now that I'm gonna have to fill

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:20.250
yeah I think you'll find something oh I know one of them obviously yeah be way

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.610
behind on holiday shopping so I got a I got that one to use you see a couple

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:36.910
hours on Amazon and I have not even launched Xbox even to watch Netflix in

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.190
at least six months expanse came out last night it's all I could do to not

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.910
stay up and watch I don't even know what that is you may have to start from the

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.950
beginning it's one of my favorite shows of all time now oh on Netflix Amazon

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:54.850
and actually Amazon they they were on sci-fi originally and Amazon bought that

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.690
they were gonna be cancer after three seasons and Amazon bought them and are

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:05.000
producing more on Amazon I haven't started yet but I'm excited to get into

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.880
the boys have you watched that no the boys is a

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.280
episode around it's a superhero show what but the superheroes there's sort of

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.680
like a Justice League type of thing but then they realize that the best

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.440
way to keep it's it's kind of like if you combine Justice League and I robot

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.520
where the the all-powerful beings realize that the way to keep peace is to

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:41.960
control it and the boys there's our set of regular people trying to revolt

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.630
against these super-powered individuals I will check it out all right so then

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:54.670
you predicted so so more on the ground for one prediction correct one prediction

00:13:54.670 --> 00:14:00.150
correct you can keep tally over there a little notepad all right you also said

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.790
this one's not self-fulfilling and it's interesting and probably worth talking

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.910
about for a moment you predicted there will be more controversy and attacks on

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:14.740
modern testing yeah and I'm happy to say and like we've said before and all

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:21.910
repeated again is we've had various attacks on modern testing mainly people

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.110
not agreeing with some of the principles or whatever there was a conference

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.630
recently where someone made a passive mark about modern testing they tried to

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.950
attack it but they didn't understand it so didn't count I guess but we had

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:39.310
someone else write a series of articles on LinkedIn sort of passively

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.190
aggressively attacking modern testing principles and what I say to them is

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:51.410
welcome to the conversation oh yeah no so I think the attacks have gone up the the

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:56.730
one individual that you're referring to is actually one of the thought leaders

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:06.320
on the traditionalist side of testing with confirmed but a confirmed quote where

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.040
they're referring to modern testing right it's it it's definitely on the

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.600
mind of the traditionalist and I do think that that's going to become more

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:24.800
more and more open yeah and to be clear the people that look funny at us are

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.040
much more in that traditional test camp and we don't mean traditional someone

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.160
brought up software testing techniques which is I said well this is

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.440
traditional they never brought it was Rex block to brought that up and

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.630
Beiser if I recall correctly Beiser wrote software testing techniques for

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.430
developers but anyway I digress I'm not going to find the quote here because of

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:52.230
my tweets or all my complaints about the impeachment hearings last night but I'll

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.760
paraphrase the people attacking this partisan paraphrase people who are

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.960
concerned with modern testing are these traditional type testers and they think

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.000
it's attacking testing but as Brent and I have said we care very little about

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.640
testing we care a lot about quality and what the principles are about is

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.320
about building quality software we call it modern testing because it's an antidote

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.400
or a alternate way of looking at the traditional way of testing last or

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.280
testing as the way as the primary way to improve or to decrease risk and

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.520
improve quality so as many people from the test community who think oh the

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:35.520
customer can't evaluate quality or you can never not have testers I'm reading

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.480
and I put a couple quotes and this is where the paraphrase is gonna come in

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.800
I'm reading the unicorn project which is about it's a horror story about a dev

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.480
ops transformation meaning they describe this company in the worst possible

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.240
state is what my all my only complaints about the book is that the

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.560
scenario they describe is so contrivedly bad and maybe their companies like this

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.720
and somebody will tell me there are that it's a little hard to go yeah okay

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.440
surely someone must have done something but anyway one of the quotes in there

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.240
is the the main character of the story Maxine is working with QA and she

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.440
makes some comment says they'll pair and help on testing here knowing

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:20.350
eventually the QA group will move into an advisory or consulting role yeah well

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.850
and it's not surprising it's like oh and this goes back to as much as you're

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.250
mad at Brent and I for the modern testing principles we're just taking

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.290
what's already there and looking at it going this is what works and writing it

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.690
down and and putting a label on it we didn't invent modern testing principles

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:43.420
much as we corralled them from our influences and how to make quality

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.460
software and experiences and I think you know moving to coaching as consultant

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:53.420
that was largely driven from my experiences and my coaching to test

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.820
teams and then moving to unity doing the same thing this is how it's

00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:02.830
supposed to work it's not a new concept but what what I think we're doing is

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:12.120
we're pointing it out as key right agile testing right the Lee Sin Lee Sin Lee Sin

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.080
binder first and last name sorry Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory for those that

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.680
don't speak Brent right they've been talking about whole team testing for a

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.280
very long time yes right and now we're and we're just putting a big the whole

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.920
team testing without your specialist taking on a coaching role really all

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:38.560
we're doing is putting a big fat exclamation point on it's contagious yeah

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.080
yeah let's do another one okay so I think like lots of head nods people are

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.480
bored as bored as Brent I'm saying I met you don't so far you also and you're

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.120
gonna be at three in a second here because you also said we'll begin to see

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:58.400
more practical applications of modern testing yes and not only are we hearing

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.400
more like I use these principles we had David from three pull out the

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.200
principles during his interview at a job which he got we have people giving

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.200
talks about modern testing we had one at the online test conference literally

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.960
I read the abstracts said wow this is cool I went to post about it to see if

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.160
that person was in our slack group and they joined as I was opening up the

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.120
slack group said hey welcome I was just don't this is not creepy I was just

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.680
thinking of you so yeah we are seeing not just people that have listened to the

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.760
podcast we're seeing it the other way maybe at first we had people listen to

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.080
the podcast going or see talks that I gave and go yeah I'm gonna there's some

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.560
of this I can go try we're seeing people discover modern testing on their

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.120
own without knowing what it is and then coming and finding us going yeah there's

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.440
a home to describe what I've already been doing right it's sort of the like

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:02.160
the the seven degrees of Kevin Bacon right now it's we are seeing signs of

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:12.290
modern testing being a thing with people not knowing the source we've had a large

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:19.790
number of people this year have presentations with on the theme or even

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:26.270
explicitly referred to modern testing it is in as part of that virality we're

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:35.640
seeing new people come into it and not knowing the source which is fine it

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:41.060
doesn't offend me at all what so what I mean is when people are introduced Alan's

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.220
looking at me for those not watching no no no I was thinking I was bored and

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.940
trying to remember who said something I wanted to bring up later I was actually

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:56.060
planning I was I was playing 3d chess with our podcast oh I appreciate the

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.300
strategy okay go on yeah so there are signs that MT starting to take on its

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:10.520
own life right it in oh and potentially in a way that that you and I will no

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.520
longer be able to control yeah that's fine I'm not worried about it and it's

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.960
not like I'd ever see someone or you either we wouldn't see someone coaching

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.600
their team and trying to make them faster go hey that's modern testing you

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.040
have to call it that that's absolutely the opposite of our intent once it once

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.560
it achieves that tipping point and it's got its own momentum to me it's gonna be

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.120
the sign that you and I need to start thinking about okay what's the no and I

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.480
think we're already there we started off talking about like here here's why

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.600
these things are important and why you think they're important too we don't

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.920
have to sell that as much anymore it's more on the practicality how do

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.490
you how do you mature on these how do you what's that transition like from

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.250
moving into a coaching role and how do you how do you keep the team sharp and

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.610
understand new things it's more of the practical and advanced application of the

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.130
principles more than the convincing people they're valid part we did in the

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:16.380
beginning yeah and then because no one's a winner all the time Brent's

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:25.210
final prediction was we will create principle number eight did not happen

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:31.500
did not need to happen not to say it will never happen yeah and you can go back to

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:41.700
episode 97 ish 96 I did I was yeah the idea there were not won't dive into

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.860
deeply was that what about the individual how do we make sure the

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:50.570
person doing this is taken care of and maybe that came up in context because as

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.250
we recorded last year's I was still on job limbo I wasn't moved into my new

00:22:55.250 --> 00:23:01.980
cool monetization Alan does what he wants role yeah we we we had a good

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:07.700
discussion on that one the way I would interpret number six is our 96 brother

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:13.660
when we talked about my proposed principle eight we had a good

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:25.430
discussion I concluded that we we at minimum both needed to be anonymous or

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:32.310
not anonymous on it being a good principle before proposing it to the

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:41.150
three as at this point in time I don't think empty we curated I don't think we

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:48.170
own it meaning it's the principle number five it's a customer's that define

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:56.230
it so I don't think we fully closed or locked it down but because we're very

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.240
ADD ridden we never brought it up again and one of the things Alan pointed out

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.400
in that episode is that I don't think there he he didn't think it was

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.720
important enough to put on there and I think time has it's I think time has

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:19.280
proven that out yeah right so yeah excellent I'm three for four all right and

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.480
that was the end of your predictions before we get to mine we had a couple

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.720
other predictions throughout the year or for that episode one was from Ryan

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.840
quell horse he had a couple but the one I want to call out is the rise of say

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:38.780
continued rise of DevOps DevOps DevOps DevOps and I think the unicorn project

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.900
and watching what they're doing with the DevOps transformation is a lot

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.140
about modern testing so I'm gonna slightly skew his prediction and show

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.500
that yes and I've said a few episodes ago and it could just be biased because

00:24:53.500 --> 00:25:00.300
I'm taking over the DevOps team at in our org at Unity but it is a fantastic

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.380
way to draw to accelerate the achievement of equality

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.580
I think that is all about 2019 absolutely in the context of the AB

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:15.410
testing podcast anyway if not the world I think 2019 was the year of DevOps I

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:22.700
can't disagree and did accelerate came out in 2018 if I remember correctly

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:29.280
wasn't a 2019 book definitely not could even in 2017 we weren't aware of

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.680
it until no I definitely read it in 2018 because it was an inspiration for me in

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:42.040
the quality culture acceleration quality culture transition guide I wrote it was

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.800
some of the inspiration for how I put that together okay so that's how I know

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:53.880
is out of year and then Tess Pappy had a couple predictions hey Patrick he said

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.800
Trump will manage to go two days in two straight days without being a total

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.000
D bag and he's wrong he failed couldn't make it two days and he also

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.400
predicted these his other prediction which also thankfully didn't happen other

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.800
than a well photoshopped or or CSS edited is he predicted there would be an

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:25.160
IST QB modern testing certification yeah yeah a little tongue-in-cheek okay many of

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.320
my predictions were also self-fulfilling I'll go through my five

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.080
predictions you can comment I said I was well on track to move myself out of

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:39.760
a role done check it's sort of what I do for better for worse and and luckily I

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:50.520
tend to land well despite everything around me I think you thrive better in

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:58.650
ambiguous environments I do I do I I do that's where I like to live I predicted

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:04.140
that I would not speak at any testing conferences 2019 I did not I spoke at

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:09.500
one conference or it of in as we talked about a few episodes ago so also true

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.950
again very easy to make that self-fulfilling come we'll come back and

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:17.950
figure out what I'm doing in 2020 I predicted that Avengers would be my

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:28.250
favorite movie of 2019 ooh struggle if he says it wasn't then he's wrong on

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:33.890
the prediction but if he says it was and it wasn't then he's a liar on air

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:47.760
what's your choice I don't know I don't think I can add I think it was like a bad

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.480
prediction that I shouldn't answer because of exact same things you just

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:58.560
said and honestly it's probably between that and Captain Marvel which a lot of

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:05.560
people didn't like I really liked it I wrote it down I I did not do a lot of

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:13.180
movies this year but of the ones that I did see and here I'm limiting it to the

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:21.340
ones that I saw in the theaters Captain Marvel was the best one I saw in theater

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:35.440
and I saw in game I did not like in game I did not I like it I actually I like

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.160
all the Marvel movies but I liked I think I liked Captain Marvel more to

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.040
interesting about that up yeah I definitely like that okay let's move on

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:48.560
my last one was not there was no way for me to make this self-fulfilling and it

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:55.760
was really made off the cuff but more on gut and maybe more on want and more of

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.600
me wanting to we have one of our listeners Michael Richard who is a big

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.000
royale Salt Lake fan that's major league soccer for those not in the US

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.880
it's it's like it's like real soccer they play in Europe just a little slower

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.920
with a little clumsier but I predicted that our local team Seattle Sounders

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:20.800
football club would make it to the MLS Cup which is a end of year tournament

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:28.160
and that they would win and I'm happy to say that not only did they win is that I

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:34.160
was at the game and had a fantastic time watching my home team win the

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.640
championship so super happy that one came true and I got to be a little bit of

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.320
a part of it exciting stuff congrats well yeah so I look mostly I kicked butt on

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.760
my predictions they were kind in hindsight they were kind of safe

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:54.160
predictions yeah you know it's better to make predictions particularly if you're

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.160
gonna get judged at the end of it it's better reading predictions that you're in

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:08.240
control of right so I recently learned I'm not a master of the soccer's but I

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:14.480
recently learned and hopefully it's a true fact that Drew Carey is either

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:22.720
owner or part owner yes he's part owner yeah I didn't I'm like oh neat he is I'm

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:30.220
a fan of Drew Carey a fan of Macklemore I could listen to thrift shop Don

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.940
repeat all day long I love that I don't know that I would say I'm a fan of

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.980
Macklemore I went to college with Michael ones Lee he sings the he's the

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.580
singer on the song and he's another part owner and Russell Wilson from the

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.920
Seahawks is another part owner okay nifty nifty

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:52.300
Nift Shop so that's it for predictions a couple other reflections which I'm gonna

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.180
I wanted to put in here but I haven't thought through for 2019 do want to

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.740
mention I'm thankful for our listeners and not just people who download the

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:11.800
show but the slack community we have is it's fantastic there is it's just people

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.240
helping each other out people willing to try things people willing to we had

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.520
people put together a github account for modern testing to try and capture all

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:27.320
our resources just all kinds of help and involvement in trying to spread the

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.720
word on what we do so a big shout out and thanks for everyone who helps out

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.960
2018

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:40.400
we're 2019 you had a 2017 prediction I think it was Brent's having your math

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:48.830
problems right you definitely had a prediction and it's not this time

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:55.680
around modern testing that or would become a thing well we want a modern

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.760
testing to be a thing and modern note you specifically called out the website

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.360
modern testing that which is just a link to the principles on anger weasel

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:14.450
calm right but because here I'm just gonna credit David directly he had the

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:19.610
idea hey this let's start putting this on github let's start organizing this

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:27.210
this get have the three do self-service stuff I actually think him being

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:34.050
motivated to do that is going to help your prediction be true albeit quite late

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:45.650
but true we are really a show about of and for the people and it's great to see

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:54.520
the community take charge and starting to add content I can't wait to see what

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.880
comes next yeah that's the fun part I can't wait to see what comes next

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.680
other let me join into predictions you probably have some I have it I have

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:10.200
several so it's funny so last year let's do some typical things so the

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.160
best of right do you have that list I know no but I in my head I do because

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.680
they didn't go over I did read through the podcast list so what was the best

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.640
episode I think I think some of these things you really easy you don't even

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:31.280
need to ask you don't even need to ask our hands-down best episode of all time

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:37.080
was the one that you weren't on no just kidding it was episode 100 that had

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:43.560
everyone on it yeah it was fantastic completely agree that was fun

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:48.830
again predictions but that was that was great I think we covered a lot of

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:53.390
ground I when I look back on the earth it will Britain I'll just talk about the

00:33:53.390 --> 00:34:00.120
same stuff every time but we don't somehow we don't I looked back and it's

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:06.120
fun to see our thought process and of what we talk about and the things change

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.400
which is great and we're rolling with it we're not stuck in the past the themes

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:15.880
are I think I mean you can always you can go back to episode one and see

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.680
themes that we're still keeping alive today so I mean we're consistent we

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:31.860
changed the scale of the content best book oh gosh I don't keep track of what

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.980
what year my books come out I'm enjoying except for the contrived the

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.540
contrivity example I gave earlier I'm enjoying the unicorn project very much

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:46.300
hmm that's probably its proximity because all the books are great when I

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:53.100
read them but I don't know what else to throw out there I'm going to say given

00:34:53.100 --> 00:35:00.860
our official a B testing declaration that 2019 was the year of DevOps the

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:06.140
absolute most important and best book for this last year and if you haven't

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:11.420
read it you still need to is accelerate okay but didn't come out in 2019 I

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:17.020
don't care okay fine it is one of my favorites is one of the books I keep

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.580
there are a handful of books I keep with an arm distance of my desk I think

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:30.020
accelerate it is if there was an MVP of books I think accelerate is an important

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.670
enough book to be up there next to product development flow yes and

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.270
actually it's another book with lean startup those are those are three three

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:44.070
books that I keep within arms distance of my desk at home all right we talked

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:51.130
about movies already I did not do much podcast listening do you have a

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:57.140
favorite Oh other podcasts yeah let me think what new podcasts I've added I've

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.700
been toying with podcast like thinking about getting a new podcast player

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.940
recently but I haven't found what I liked other than the the old-fashioned

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:09.010
what I'm using but that's a total big tangent I found what's it called

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:15.090
give me a moment let me bring up two podcasts that I discovered over the last

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:25.350
year that I really like one is speaking a DevOps DevOps DevOps it's arrested

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:29.330
DevOps if you get it it's a play on arrested development but arrested DevOps

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:34.650
is pretty good good interviewers I like what they do they had I found the show

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:38.970
when Nicole Forsger was on it and she was fantastic on her episode and I've

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:44.560
listened every episode since the other one I listen to is nothing to do with

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.160
software but you know I I like trivia I'm always adding trivia podcast sometimes

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:56.370
I drop them because they they're sucky but I like puzzles too and the one I

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:02.410
probably added most recently that I like is a podcast called escape escape

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:10.630
this podcast and what it is it's a verbal it's an escape room done via

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:17.640
conversation okay so it says you're in a room here's what you see and then the

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.460
host has to say you know here's what you find as you as you discover things and

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:28.040
it's it's fun I just like the lateral thinking of those things it's it the

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.520
problem is they're about an hour long and most podcasts I can pause in the

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.880
middle and come back I need to kind of do these on road trips where I can

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.190
listen to the whole thing okay because I kind of want to listen to 60 minutes all

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.110
at once but yeah I've enjoyed that my favorite new podcast is that one

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.710
favorite one to write that the listeners would like is arrested DevOps

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:52.150
that's an interesting concept how about you man oh I'm only like five or episodes

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.590
in and I'm way behind I've been around for a couple years so I have plenty

00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:00.590
more information to go through no so because of the degree as I mentioned if

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:05.790
I don't spend time on on on Xbox right you can pretty much guarantee I'm not

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:11.470
gonna do much on podcasts got a drive to work man you got a drive to work yeah

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.990
lately I've been listening to my radio station down in California I had noticed

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:22.750
that they stream and those who are familiar with the station in LA called

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:30.070
Caro Q this year the famous morning show Kevin and Bean being left the

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:39.500
episode or left the show moved to England and that show has been sort of a

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:49.680
big part of my daily ritual for decades gotcha I do have a best TV show oh

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:56.200
interesting cuz I don't watch much TV yeah oh well and you I know you cut

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.720
the cable I yeah well you do but you get all the same channels have you heard of

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.680
the show the masked singer I have seen a commercial for it this is actually good

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:17.800
oh it's awesome love that show I can't say enough about it but we're at a time

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:26.040
when we got to predict things okay I will put it on my list I have YouTube

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:31.960
TV so I'm sure they have recordings of I can go find you can just make sure so

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.840
it's very much about you're gonna go into it I'll let you know so just

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:44.090
giving you it it's a guessing game you're trying to figure out who's in this mask

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:49.920
right when I have to know there's ruin the fun really quick and if you go up

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.920
on YouTube there's a good chance because of the search engine you're you'll

00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:00.640
be watching something and then in the search box down below it'll be oh the

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:08.360
peacock revealed as an example so it's a lot more fun if you if you don't know

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:16.670
the result shall we get into it I have what a whole bunch of predictions to be

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.910
wrong on next year okay and I don't have any prepared but I'll see if I can

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:27.630
come up with some okay go for it all right let me start with the one that

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:41.400
will drive you the most insane politics I predict Trump will get reelected but I

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:48.590
also predict Pelosi will keep the house listeners of the show may or may not

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:53.870
realize I am a libertarian so that puts me in a position where I continuously

00:40:53.870 --> 00:41:01.320
either agree or disagree with you I think both of the the two parties are

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:09.520
wrong quite often but none of my candidates will ever ever ever ever show

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.960
up I don't disagree and and just to be clear I have survived through

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:19.600
presidents I have not agreed with for many years and I'm okay with that

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.130
that's the way politics works it's the way the country works were yes what I

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:28.890
don't agree with is a president committing crimes and having his party

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:35.000
back him up because for party lines that shouldn't happen as an independent I

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.260
will say and you'll see this in the reports the majority of the independence

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:50.160
and I will lie with I will stand with this don't think the impeachment trials

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:57.400
are concluding the way the Democrats are espousing I do think if they continue

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.120
focus on this it will actually harm the Democratic Party and that will be why

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.960
Trump wins yeah I think there's a good unfortunately there's a good chance of

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:11.590
that yeah I'm still glad it's happening yeah all right move on to something else

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:16.710
okay if any other day besides after me watching six hours of impeachment

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:26.090
last night driving you crazy I would like to move on I'll just start at the top so

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:31.610
we spent a lot of time talking about DevOps I am going to introduce a term I

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:36.490
don't think we've ever talked about on the show oh god and I think this term

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:45.370
will mainstream next year the term is AI ops interesting well tell me about

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:51.800
because we have an ML ops we talk about ML ops a lot at Unity so I don't know ML

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:57.720
and AI are different so talk to me about AI ops AI ops there's another term you

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:05.320
may not have heard of which is RPA and I forget the P but it's robotic process

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.360
automation okay and by the way Jason Huggins on the show that was one of my

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.290
other highlights of the year oh yeah that was fantastic I completely agree

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:25.330
the croissants are Selenium go on yeah so DevOps is is essentially the dev team in

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:29.690
a nutshell the way where the the name comes from is the dev team owns

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:33.450
operations it's not a separate team you have to create in you have to create

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.770
monitors you have to continuously monitor the situation yet to respond

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:46.210
quickly okay that decision-making will begin to move to artificial intelligence

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:53.610
ML ops is kind of a in my humble opinion sort of a nonsensical concept because

00:43:53.610 --> 00:44:00.290
machine learned is it's not decision-making but it's around gathering

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:05.210
the data to make it easier to make those decisions so I view ML as sort of a

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:13.690
way to scale DevOps but AI ops where the decision is made if by a robotic system

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:19.890
will begin to mainstream next year that's a prediction cool that's a good

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:29.310
prediction go on MT will mainstream next year what does that mean talk me oh and

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:34.790
I knew you would ask because I told you I'm good at asking questions yes yes

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:49.630
yes here's what I lay down I will say up front that literally it will be wrong but

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:56.080
I think it from a probabilistic point of view I will end up being more right than

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:05.320
wrong I believe that there will be one talk per major test conference specifically

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:14.400
containing or about modern testing this next year I think that could happen I

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.880
like that and and I want to be because when I say about I don't know that

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.400
qualifies as mainstream but it definitely gives it closer to the tipping

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:31.950
point yes I think on the tipping point discussion I do with some of the

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:38.030
convergence of modern testing and AI ops and software by Alan Page I do think

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:42.990
one of the things that's a potential because I people following me know I've

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.790
been constantly looking for wins the tipping point wins the tipping point

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:51.630
wins the tipping point I'm actually beginning to worry that that the

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:56.470
tipping point will not occur because the tipping point of the next of

00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:04.280
post-modern testing will actually occur first huh right because if for example if

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:12.840
AI ops does mainstream that that leapfrogs that that leapfrogs a lot of

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:19.560
this stuff sure and I'm gonna comment on that one and get a prediction to hear

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.360
myself because we could make that self-fulfilling I could go give a talk

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.120
on modern testing in every major testing conference that I predict that's not

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:34.930
going to happen I predict once again I will I will speak at exactly one

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:40.690
conference in 2020 and to be clear and I'll totally honest I have no

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:46.850
conferences lined up I haven't I've said no to everybody so far people are not

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.290
asking me anymore because I say no all the time which is great but I will

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:55.250
predict I will speak at one conference in 2020 it won't be a testing conference

00:46:55.250 --> 00:47:03.080
it won't be no I'm it may be a DevOps conference maybe a dev conference maybe

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.680
something else I don't know but I'm not speaking at any testing conferences but

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.200
I will I do think I'll speak at one conference I don't know which one yet I

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.840
should probably figure that out just pointing out that I'm not gonna make

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.800
this happen by showing up and giving talks at test no the thing is is I'm

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:22.760
like hmm I have a big gaping hole now in my life since I don't it says I

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:29.440
don't have school maybe it's time for test bash Seattle oh and if I do test

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:36.880
bash Seattle I can guarantee that Alan's prediction will be wrong so much

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:46.280
time plotting for my demise the the other thing on MTV I wrote down two

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:52.120
criteria one I think a one talk per every major conference and I'll even

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:58.840
say not by us and even potentially by people we don't know yet currently not a

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:07.150
member not of the three I think MT attackers will grow yeah I think we're

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:12.550
going to start seeing right now 2018 we see a lot of passive aggression that

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.510
right I think it'll start being direct I think that I think name calling will

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:21.790
begin I think that's inevitable and that's yeah I mean name calling should

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:27.430
continue I've been called things no name calling on MT yeah yeah I mean

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:35.030
you're a dick I had that when we call that I can recall one conversation about

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:40.630
principle number five or I was told I was ignorant and wrong and and harming

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:47.950
the craft yeah but I think we're modern animals got deeply sucked into that one

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:54.550
modern testing is a threat to those that make a living relying on testing as the

00:48:54.550 --> 00:49:00.140
primary way to reduce risk in the project testing is not the threat the

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:06.250
threat is the world's changing we put a name on it like yes that us we're those

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:13.330
people taking down modern testing does not save their careers I know I deny

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:18.490
change is what they're saying when they call me an asshole right that's fine

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:26.000
whatever and into those who like we see the change going in and if they say hey

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.520
we're harming the craft no we're naturally not because the craft is on

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.880
its way to death and I don't care about the craft I care about the people who

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.240
are in their skill sets and I care about quality and I care about helping

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:46.600
those people transition into the new world yeah and I will not be silenced

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:55.630
blah blah blah okay observability the term observability will kill the term

00:49:55.630 --> 00:50:03.440
testability um I have no idea how I'm going to measure success or failure on

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.160
that I don't know so I look at that differently I would tell you why that

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.600
one's gonna be wrong now I look at my biggest two levers to improve quality

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:17.160
our testability which which includes the testing we do like how quickly can we

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.320
do the testing we need to do before we deploy and operability which includes

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.240
observability among how we do to safe deployments etc but I look at those as

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.680
done done equal and what I got now I can't paraphrase the quote of the damn

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.960
show but I look at those as equal levers I have to help improve the

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.880
quality of what I think is gonna happen so tell me tell me the difference

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.600
what's gonna what's gonna rock my world here's what's gonna happen all right as

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:48.680
empty progresses the term testability is brought up because of separation of

00:50:48.680 --> 00:51:00.310
disciplines as empty continues and dev takes over this testability isn't a word

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:04.430
that's in that language we don't have it I still think of it as testability

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:09.350
it's all the work we do to make all the code correctness and code simplicity

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:17.010
stuff and being able to easily write enough tests that will all disappear

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:24.600
that will all just so be wrapped into what does it mean to be a developer yes

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.960
and that's really what it's about that and on that front testability will

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:35.840
become accountability look sure right yeah I get that observability is very

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:40.080
similar to testability except what we're now trying to look at is customer we're

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.840
gonna have a whole podcast about this because I agree with you but my my

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.440
definitions and how it happens are different okay so we're gonna talk about

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.080
testability and operability at an upcoming podcast go on let me go

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.160
through we have people looking in the window I only have a few things and I

00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:02.640
can go very quickly I do think in 2020 we're gonna start seeing everyone

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:09.800
becoming sort of a compliance expert gross I hate it too but necessary I think

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:16.000
it'll be necessary the personal note I think I will start guitar lessons this

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.640
next year all right I have a huge hole mentioned over and over again and then

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:31.530
on the sports front I think the Niners will play but lose to the Ravens in the

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:37.330
NFC championships and not make the Super Bowl and this saddens me greatly and I

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:41.690
hope I am wrong on that prediction on the the quick my sports front thank you

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:45.610
for those I don't really care about the Niners and really really who does

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:49.450
that's American football the one where you don't use your feet for our foreign

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:53.730
listeners I predict on the Sounders front the Sounders will make the playoffs

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:58.210
the 12 straight straight year but they will not win the MLS Cup they'll

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:03.340
probably lose in the the conference championship the semi-final

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:08.060
conference championship but I do predict they will make it to the final of the

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:13.100
CCL the CONCACAF Champions League where they will lose to one of the Mexican

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:20.670
teams not the galaxy they're not in they didn't they didn't make the CCL yeah I

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:27.430
only know two football clubs and that's probably all I didn't prepare any

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:31.670
predictions I gave lots of feedback on Brent's anything else really quickly

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:35.470
here before we close up I predict I already gave you my conference

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:44.240
prediction I gave you that yeah I'm gonna oh here's one I have as long as

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.710
Brent's know me I've changed jobs every two years the end of year next year will

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:54.430
be almost two years of mine in my current job I will predict that one year

00:53:54.430 --> 00:54:00.840
from now I'll still be in this job and we'll have at least another year after

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.280
that I think it's gonna take me longer to work myself out of this role that's

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:11.040
good for you it is I suppose all right happy holidays happy 2019 thank you

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.880
everyone for listening once again I'm still Alan I'm Brent and we'll see you

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.960
later see you in the new year
