WEBVTT

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.440
Hello again everyone. Good morning. He's Brent. He's Alan

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.720
Welcome to another episode of a B testing happy to have you here. Good to see you Brent. Good to see you, too

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720
I'm recording on a Monday. How is your weekend?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.500
It was great. I finally won some points from the family

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.870
Did you just spend the weekend away from them?

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.360
No

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.440
Did you at this point in time? I still have my daughter who still likes me. Okay, that's good. Yeah, good. Just

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680
Just make a bunch of food for them what you do. How'd you win some points?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.720
I did actually make something about tell me about the point scoring system. I finally put the pool up. Oh

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.100
And it perfect time is supposed to be hot hot hot it this week

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.570
It took me two days to put the pool up

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.970
Yeah, because I could only stand being out

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.650
side doing

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.090
Manual labor in the full Sun for like an hour at a time

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.170
Well, there are things called mornings and evenings where it's a little cooler. I had the plan to do it in the morning

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.510
But my daughter got up and wanted to play and that sounded like more fun than putting up the pool. I suppose cool

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.020
This is episode 86 by the way

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.600
It is if you're new to a be testing this is the podcast by Alan and Brent that's the a and the B

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.860
Where we talk about?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.220
Testing sometimes a lot of software engineering software quality

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.120
Of course modern testing principles have been the topic

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.380
For the last many many episodes. Yeah, you can go to modern testing org and read those

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.820
And we have been doing recently some deeper dives medium dives spending about an episode each discussing them

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.940
Drill ins drill ins we're gonna call them. Is that a Microsoft term?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.180
Maybe maybe well, it's definitely management

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.760
Management-speak. I like what they say. Let's double click on that here that one. Let's double click and shift left

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.640
Let's I want to shift out

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.220
Shift out. I'm gonna just gonna drop. You know what I'm gonna do shift up

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.060
I mean, there's so many directions to shift I know and I don't have nearly as many meetings

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.420
In fact, I have one-on-ones and then like two or three other meetings a week

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.220
But I wish I had more cuz I one thing I would like to do cuz it's fun. You wish I'm sorry

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.620
No, no, no, you wish you had more meetings

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.380
I wish I had some bad meetings cuz I wish I I wanted it go like

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.420
You know to my car just just to go to meetings and have some of the bad ones again

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.380
Where I could just drop random buzzwords that mean nothing and see if they catch on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.730
like we should shift out on that or

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.650
That'd be great

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970
Hold on a second. Let's right-click on that and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.200
And get some more context

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.360
Yeah, so the trick is to come up with something entirely new though. Oh

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.090
Yeah, yeah, cuz everyone's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.930
You know, they're just evolving

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.120
Like why is it left shift? Why isn't it right shift? Well shift, right? Right

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.430
Correct. So, uh, I mean you got the double entendre with right. So if you shifted right

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.590
Right, the direction doesn't matter and you it could be implying, you know, you're going more correct. You're shifting to correct. Oh

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.840
It could be it could be so I need to think for a minute. What's that? What's like a computing term?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.480
It hasn't been used in a managerial speak

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.100
I'm thinking something like a long lines of distributed networks. They're all the rage right now

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.060
You got big data, but you know if you try to invent something now, you're like five years too late

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.850
Alright, I'm gonna come up with those so you can send those in to the mailbag at a B testing

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.770
Sure yet another place where a B testing adds value to the world. We'll start creating whole new buzzwords. Sure

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.330
Sure, that's our that's our value to the world in between last time and this time. I

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.470
Spoke to the internet a little bit about

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.470
Modern testing again. I did an AMA and asked me anything for a Ministry of test and

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.020
I will there is a recording of it available

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.780
I will put in a link if I don't you can yell at me on Twitter

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.080
But I will try and remember when I post this show to put a link to the recording where I answered a bunch of questions

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.840
Hosted by our good friend Vernon and I answer questions about modern testing

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.360
Yeah, I went back and I watched that video first off it was your video I threw it worse

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.880
I forgot it's a video. So I totally shouldn't have picked my nose so much. You really shouldn't have

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.680
And it was shocking. I'm like, oh my god Alan's face. I'm like is the whole world ready for this

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.800
There's a reason we do a podcast. There's a reason we do a podcast

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.720
Yeah, mostly me but yeah

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.320
for sure

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.820
I am certainly glad I did not join you in that adventure because some of those questions were really hard

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.320
I'm glad you didn't join because you give really long answers and I gave longer answers

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.080
We got to the end Vernon tried to go rapid-fire, but I couldn't let it go

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.670
Sometimes right there was one time you were like no

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.780
And then I elaborated

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.300
We're going to dive into

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.320
principle number five five of seven and this is the one about the customer and

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.980
Surprisingly, there's a little bit of controversy around this one. We'll go into anything else before we dive in

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.440
You know, let's go to go. Okay again. You can read these on modern testing org, but principle number five says

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.960
We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.680
Agreed. Yeah

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.080
Okay, and thank you for listening to a be testing

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.560
Yeah, yeah, that was one of your questions on on AMA

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.900
before we reflect back on that

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.620
briefly

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.460
Tell me and I'm gonna go to the controversy to the controversy the question, but before we do that, tell me

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.420
Why is this the principle? What why is this worth bringing up along with the other six?

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.520
The number one reason and I've cited this over number one

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.280
The I've cited this over and over again. One of the things that I think

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360
especially

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.440
true for those of us who have been in the industry for a long time and

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:10.070
It is sort of seductive to believe that hey, I've been doing this forever. I know what I'm doing

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.030
You've seen a lot of folks along those lines

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.830
but there is a

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:25.100
forgetting is how I'll call it as I cited from Tom Popendike over and over again

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.620
No customer ever in the history of the world has ever wanted software

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.330
Correct in any way shape or form

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.690
What do they want before you go on they want their problem solved?

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.310
Absolutely. We need to remember that that means

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.780
There is a risk and I have observed this and I'm highly certain you have as well

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.540
that there is

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.950
trust in

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:02.510
the test community that when they're given a requirement stock or when they're told something from

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.310
their PM

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.120
that

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.540
That actually is going to solve somebody's problem down the road

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:18.320
A big portion of this principle is intended to force people to think about

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.120
What are they doing?

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.820
That is actually solving a customer problem theoretically

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.510
versus actually and it's it's to force the

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.380
The modern tester to go

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.220
No matter how right I think I am

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.060
It's still just a theory

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:49.300
It's a hypothesis. It's a hypothesis. You want to pick up? Yeah, sure. So what I've

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.980
What I've seen and to build on them

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.740
We can both reflect and probably anybody who's been doing software for a reasonable amount of time

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.700
Reasonable amount of time or any but probably a lot some of you

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.300
Maybe this week last week

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.660
You are on a team or you've seen teams who build software

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.580
Because they think it'll be cool

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:17.600
Or we're doing this feature because the we like it without often thinking about what problem are you solving?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.760
It's amazing sometimes when you talk to teams and just ask them that question

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.280
What problem are we solving with this? They'll eat they'll use it that isn't solving a problem

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.600
And well, what's what's what's the customer value of this?

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.040
they'll use it and

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:44.240
Well, I've seen this over and over and Brent's laughing but you think about it. It's it's they're not quite sad because evil

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.000
but in my experience, but generally darn close I I've told the story for years about shimmery blue menus and

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.320
and

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.360
There was a time at Microsoft and this is a

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.300
A joke I used to make when I was teaching courses ten years ago

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.640
It's been a long time about shimmery blue menus because shimmery blue menus are not a real feature

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.700
I'm just these are my canonical example of something you're building because you think it's cool

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.820
But nobody really needs it and what happens is the program manager

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.460
Wants thinking about features they need to do they go what about shimmery blue menus

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.540
You know, huh? We should do shimmery blue menus and then someone will say

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.420
maybe we'll say

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.740
Problem does that solve and they'll say uh customers need it and they'll justify it

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.540
They'll go to a customer and say hey, do you think we need shimmery blue menus? They go sir, whatever

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.160
Customers are demanding shimmery blue menus. They're waiting for this feature. We got to go do it

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:47.140
maybe that's a little bit of a stretch, but there's so much reflection in my past of doing features and

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:54.100
The build it and they will come mentality field field of dream software. Yes, we're gonna build this thing and

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.420
We'll give it to you after a long development cycle and we trademark feel the dream software

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.630
and even though feel the dream is probably and in the end you will like it, but

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.410
Right, oh this part I've seen over and over again I have

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:18.520
This is hyperbole, but there is there wait hyperbole on the a B testing

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.820
Whoa, I'm gonna be careful because it's modern

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.080
We're much more modern world, but let's just say I

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.720
Don't know five ten years ago

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:34.080
it was impossible to have a conversation with the PM and not walk away with the sense that

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.360
They were the next Steve Jobs. Oh god, right? It's it's

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.760
requirements stock what a lot of the requirements stock is is built off of

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.680
Processes similar to what Alan just described. It is hey a customer

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.920
PM

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.500
they have their own day job to do and sometimes it's calling out the customers and

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.860
They will call out to one or two and and establish a pattern off of that

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.380
Now is that a pattern? No, of course not

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.340
however, their job is to get new features in and

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.460
If they they've encountered a new

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.490
Requirement that they could build upon that's fantastic

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:32.330
right that they're able to do add that requirement into the dock and and

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.700
Get engineering rolling now, it's interesting because you say shimmery blue

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.310
I've actually

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:49.500
Had to deal with that and it literally was blue. It wasn't shimmery

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.600
Years ago. I was an MSTV and Microsoft was building the software for Comcast and

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.960
Comcast rejected our our

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.760
Software not once but twice

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.090
Because we had the wrong

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.400
blue in our CSL and

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.470
And I'm like

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.910
Wow really

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.230
Yes, and again twice

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.670
There's a design choice there and there's plenty stories about Google trying out 50 different or ever in shades of blue

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.670
It was for their links for they chose the right one

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.470
In the case of of

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:39.470
Comcast right blue is part at least it was back then now they got this red black and white team with their Xfinity stuff but

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.310
blue

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:46.510
Blue was part of the brand Donna get ditched cable. I don't know. I was gonna bring something

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:52.350
Oh, I had a little I glazed over for a minute there while my PTSD kicked in on when just showing out

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.630
When the job his book came out or the first couple jobs books came out after he passed away. Oh

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.510
Oh my god, so many when there was one in particular

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.700
I'll finish my thought a bunch of people decided to start comparing themselves to Steve Jobs

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.940
Literally, and there's one high-level

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.900
Test director you and I both know I won't shame him on the air who who in a meeting

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.720
no

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.240
metaphor aside flat-out said

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.760
Because I'm making this choice this is what Steve Jobs do he basically called himself Steve Jobs

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:35.440
And that was that was like oh god, please please let it in please let it in but even Steve Jobs

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.480
I'm so whining back. I'm like

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.740
We don't know any test directors

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.470
Because they're gone

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:52.270
We did they were Peter principled up to a level far beyond the capability and since retired once

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.910
Once in the new world figured out they had no, you know, it's funny

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.590
I'm because we know so many of those folks and

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
Several of them are alike. I

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.660
Cannot guess who it is at the moment. I'll let you know off-air. Yeah

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:18.040
I have several guesses. Yeah, I'm pretty sure all of them having that conversation. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you could nail it

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.400
wasn't Steve Jobs who when there was the

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.440
camera which iPhone it was but there was an antenna issue and

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.010
Wasn't he the one that said it's cuz they're holding it wrong. I don't think

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.810
That I think that was one of his but that's a great example

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:40.990
I mean it doesn't matter and the customer customer is the only one capable to evaluate quality and they

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.190
Can't hold the phone. However, they frickin want to hold the phone, right? Right

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.620
This is still prevalent

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.200
In today's world like I have conversations similar to this over and over and over again

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:03.160
This principle is essentially the modern testing version of the customer is always right

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:10.160
Perhaps perhaps and so let's talk about which it makes so much common sense, but let me play

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.960
Simon Devils advocate. I'm gonna bring up the controversy and let you there's believe it or not. There is controversy around

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.600
this testing principle

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.220
Probably this one is

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.420
Probably second on the if you're gonna rank them in order of controversy behind principle number seven

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.980
Some of you are going how the hell can this be controversial? But let me bring up a few points for you. So

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.980
Here's the easy one as testers

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.660
We are the customer

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.420
We're the last line of defense Brent. We're the only ones capable of

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:52.000
Sympathizing and making sure the customer is getting it. So really as a tester. I am the customer

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.320
No

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.120
So

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.160
Yeah, that that's a little bit of a softball, but no, I mean no no, it's just no you're not the customer and and

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.960
I'm I figured this part out years ago, but doesn't matter how much you're trying to replicate. Here's an example

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.740
Do you remember int int?

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.740
Remember data type no int the integration environment. Oh my god

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.700
There is a time early in the services world of Microsoft where there's this massive

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.560
Ridiculous integration environment that was done

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:38.560
It was people tried to do testing there and they wanted it to replicate production as much as they could and it never even got close

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.120
never ever ever ever and

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.870
and

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.710
They held on to the theory that it would

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:54.010
Hindsight 2020 I'm not at all certain why

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.810
But the biggest cause

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:04.930
And this was actually something that test played into it one of the one of the problems with with our

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.330
Automation

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:14.690
We would target automation that would deploy out in it and one of the biggest issues with it with a with a

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.290
non-prod int environment

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:24.540
Particularly with how automation was deployed is it was always covering

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.380
the clean room

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:35.620
Scenario sure and I have nothing against integration environments and doing testing in some sort of pre-production environment that there's

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.900
Plenty of reasons to do that

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.380
But do not ever kid yourself and think that your pre-production environment

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:50.220
Whatever you call it is a reasonable facsimile for production. Yeah, absolutely it it is

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:56.840
It simulates production environment exactly once in its lifetime

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.680
And even even then not exactly because it's not running on the same hardware

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:10.320
It's it's it's running differently in production. It could I mean, I mean that's still it's still possible

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.960
Do your teams at Microsoft use Docker? Did teams use Docker at Microsoft? Oh my

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.920
God, you know what just before coming in here. I was gonna I was gonna share with you off the air

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.790
around

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.870
Dude, I don't understand how we got stuff done back in the day without containers

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.270
because that that Docker has been one example where it's

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.430
Containerization has helped with test environments making them much closer again for one time only

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:48.790
But giving you a much closer to production environment as much easier and quicker to set up and tear down. Yeah containers

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.630
my experience with containers

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.310
they keep talking about

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.560
Those of us in the cloud industry we keep talking about

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.890
That it's some future date

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.570
Compute will be the fifth utility

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.280
behind water and electricity and

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.360
So

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.320
You don't have to spend much time with containers

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.650
To go. Oh, I see how that's gonna be possible

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.330
containers

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:30.050
They just work and they just do the calculation that you want them to do

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.880
Right and it's just like whoa. I didn't have to configure crap

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.200
I didn't have to yell at IT for rebooting my container. I didn't have to do any of this

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.980
No, like it's just friggin fantastic

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.140
From a platform side and from a developer side. I will say

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.500
That does create problems for us in the cloud industry

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.340
Because we have this sort of generic

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:05.120
compute interface at the top, but yeah underneath it it's running on different pieces of hardware and and

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.940
Each component and that hardware could be could be

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.260
very different

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.380
Right. We have a new generation of hardware in Azure

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.990
And it took us months to realize that there was this one

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.990
memory chip vendor

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.830
who had

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:35.190
poorly manufactured it for us to figure out that that was what was causing these containers would

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.190
To reboot even though they shouldn't

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.190
Let me really back in to the customer. Yep. Ask another question. So

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:49.370
What if so testing is not the customer testing is not the customer and that

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.130
Above and beyond everything is what we want to get across

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:59.250
Okay, but but but but but but but but okay my I have a B2B business

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.490
So is whose mic so I'm meaning I business to business

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.010
I my software just for the listeners who may not have heard that acronym before

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:13.250
but so I'm making something for another business to do something with or and then they have a

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.170
customer

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.170
Who's like which one's my customer?

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.070
What are my choices?

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.790
this business I'm delivering software to or

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.390
maybe the

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.230
Is it who I'm delivering it to or the end customers? Like is it the end user?

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.920
like if I'm giving a

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.360
platform to some company and they're using it to build software for

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.240
Maybe their internal systems or maybe for an external customer

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.560
How does that work?

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.360
Who is who is my customer? How do I figure out who my customer actually is?

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:51.150
In a platform situation that can be challenged right because you when you're a platform foot. So for example

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.160
Unity I want to bring it up directly. I'll let you do it right unity is a

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:08.410
I'm sure you guys I think it's a little easier in our case my customer. Well for most of it the vast majority

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:15.890
This is actually a good question unity holistically our customer is the developer the developer making unity but not in every situation

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:23.840
You definitely have two customers. We do we do and in the B2B play you also definitely have two customers

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.120
Right in the case of unity

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.950
Developers who want to design games

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.250
They don't have to go to unity

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:45.320
There are what five to ten major game engines out on the market

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.960
They don't have to go right your company. So what differentiates what differentiates is the capabilities and

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:02.920
Well, so there was a long experience could be capabilities and features or ease of use lots of things. Yeah in

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.720
one of the in one of the

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.400
Analyses I would do at your company is

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.520
Go and look at okay

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:22.360
How do we grow the attach rate of of the developers on the unity platform? How do we once they once they try us out?

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.440
How do how do we get them to stay?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:30.800
How do they get how do we get them to engage with us directly on on on feature requests?

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.240
This actually was the Microsoft play back in the 19 early 1990s. Sure

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.280
Right. Um, it was we got the developer we got the world

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.650
but the other aspect is as well is

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.410
These developers are building software

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:54.010
for end users and it's that end user where

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.290
Ultimately

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.510
Your guys's paycheck comes from correct. Well, I mean

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:07.060
Yes, ultimately yes, but it's a you can draw a feed you could there's a nice feedback loop there

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:13.620
Yes, we need to enable our developer customers to give

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.540
Their customers something world

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.220
Value awesomeness and then that feedback comes to them and then comes by us

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:27.520
Do you can I can't draw it on a podcast but there's a nice little there's a nice little loop there, right?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.260
If your platform has performance issues

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.820
So for example in

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.820
Or if our if our game engine components crash

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.980
right, you're not

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:50.060
You're basically going to be a platform that gets abandoned because the the developers who are using your platform

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.580
Can't make their customers happy. Correct? Correct. So in that particular case

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:02.710
The two sets of people who are your customer are your developers and are the developers of your platform in

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.310
True and I think it's gonna be the same for and the end their customers

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:13.110
They it's gonna be same for I would imagine that's the same for any sort of business to business type thing as well

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.710
any any place where it's essentially a platform component that's

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:23.310
Indirectly talking trying to think where it would be difficult to figure out who your customer is, right? But I

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.840
Honestly, if you can't figure out who your customer is if it's that difficult I

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.680
Think is a deeper problem there in your software company. I

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:40.860
Yeah, I think I can understand why it would be it could be difficult to get feedback from an end user

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.580
but here

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.190
But there are still ways right it

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.510
There so in a B2B play let's let's say

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:03.990
Actually, this was this was big news recently Walmart and Azure are joining hands

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.620
we

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.140
You could it's very easy to see

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.370
That

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.290
Walmart competes with Amazon in the retail space

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.970
Azure competes with Amazon on the cloud space

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:31.390
So does does Microsoft want Walmart to improve and and winning in their particular market you bet

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.590
Right now

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:43.030
That's probably the as far in the details on that particular topic. I can go into on any of these indirect things

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:51.180
On a platform you live and die on the ability of the people above you to satisfy their customers if you don't have direct customers

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.260
Now one of the things

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.140
That I've seen on the B2B discussion is oh no

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.380
So so some company comes down and leads on requirements

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.580
And I'm just gonna say anytime anyone delivers

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.630
requirements

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.150
You're better suited to treat those as hypotheses

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:19.230
Let's let me loop this back may need to deliver on those requirements because the contractual agreement. Let me just finish there

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.370
but

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.690
That's the bare minimum and you should be gathering

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:30.270
Whatever data you can if you think one of those requirements is baloney

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:35.630
You should be gathering whatever data you can and go back to that contract and say hey

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:41.150
We actually think our relationship is better going in this direction and here's our

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.030
information that back set up

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.030
One of the things I think can help

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:52.390
Someone a team practicing modern testing principles or someone leading the team in that direction to

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:58.510
Really nail this principle is to have those conversations around things like requirements talk about

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.230
Or ask what is the problem we're solving? Yes, and

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.430
From that requirement and may change from that. I think requirements end up being a lot versus

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.710
being a lot of want to versus need and

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.270
asking questions like

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.030
What problem are we solving will help will help vet that out?

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:22.510
There's a question our good old friend and sometimes listener Jim Moore used to ask all the time

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.670
But someone would would get come to him with some long request

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.990
Or some complex request something they wanted

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.510
He would follow up. This is a great question

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.720
So imagine you had all that what do you do with it?

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:41.680
And they give an answer and from that you can figure out what they really need and go. Okay. Could I just do this instead?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.350
Oh, yeah, that'd be great and and you need a

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:53.230
Team following modern testing principles who embraces this principle are going to be very good at asking the questions

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.550
Whether they're around a requirement slash hypothesis

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.590
customer request from a forum for example

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.870
customers engaging online tend to be a

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:11.550
Just loud majority of your customers but not representative of all your customers. So you don't just want to make them happy you want to figure out

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.650
What customer problem can we solve so learning how to ask questions around?

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:26.110
Problems you're solving trying to understand need versus want can really help make your team excel at this principle

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.480
For sure. That's my brief little soapbox on this. Yeah

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:38.260
For me the best thing I have found is anytime someone has communicated

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.780
requirements

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:47.140
To me I will echo back the requirements, but I will use them

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.260
Okay, so what you're requesting from me

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:56.980
I will change it to the word requests in my communication back and then in my thought process

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:02.460
I view the word requirement and hypothesis as synonyms and

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:09.060
I find that that last aspect whether or not you do it publicly or doing it privately

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.780
I think that aspect is actually really

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.620
important

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.180
Because it'll it forces you to consider

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.500
That you may be doing work that does not achieve the ultimate goal and that

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.920
Goal is where all these precision questions that Alan just referred to come from

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:39.260
There are many times where I have been told what to do and in general that is because that's that's that

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.520
Individuals best gets as to what can be done

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.890
And I have found that more often than not

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:54.510
That if you can decompose that and figure out what it is that they need

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.990
Mm-hmm now sometimes

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:02.950
You'll do exactly okay. I get what you need and yeah, I can't think of a better way of doing this for sure for sure

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:10.430
In in my scenario with you know, they're coming to me to do it generally because I'm the knowledge expert. I

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.390
Know more things about this space than what they do

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:21.210
Which gives me the opportunity to go. No, I think actually what you need is this. How about if I do this instead?

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.050
what you end up doing when you really execute on this principle is

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:33.250
You solve customer problems in priority order like what's the biggest problem you understand

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.870
What's the biggest problem we can solve for our customers and you solve that you help that you help them solve that

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.070
and you move down the list so

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.150
It's as much about

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.370
Misdelivering quality

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.770
by or

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.330
delivering value to the customer by

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.130
Solving their most and most important problems first

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.280
Yes

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.480
Now let's talk about scorecards

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.060
No, let's not

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.860
Okay, fine. Let's talk about scorecards. Thank you. I know it's one of your least favorite topics

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.900
but I think it's I tell stories about why I hate them so much, but let me

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:17.010
But go I think I think we should talk about it right the the if we're saying the customer

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.290
so the controversy with this principle is

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:26.790
What is the definition of customer? Okay, and what we're saying?

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:32.690
It is a human who is taking a dependency on what you are

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.210
releasing and

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:41.770
That human is the one who's making a decision as to whether or not it is quality

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.960
Okay

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.320
So if you have a business to business

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.440
Contractual agreement that's not a human who's taking a dependency. That's a piece of paper

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.830
Now it may specify

00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:02.550
Hypotheses around this and the maven specify legal consequences if you don't deliver on those hypotheses

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.390
But just recall that there's still a hypothesis

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:11.020
Now we could have a scorecard that says that we delivered on it. Okay now

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:21.750
So let's say you delivered a scorecard all green and it released to the wild and you're in this B2B scenario

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.130
You still run the risk

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.120
Because you delivered what that other business wanted instead of what they needed

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:36.470
You still run the risk that they pay you for your contract and then leave you

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:41.270
Sure, because and there are probably I didn't dig any out in advance

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:48.390
But anecdotally from my experience I can tell you this happens or happened frequently or not rarely

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:55.030
Not yeah, not really. I've seen this happen as have I

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:04.390
Trying to remember that stupid phone product Microsoft built Oh kin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was kin. Yeah

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.590
That was that was a required. It was essentially

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.520
Someone or some set of someones had this idea of

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.480
producing a a

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.280
Hybrid dumb smartphone

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.680
Yeah, right. It was smart enough phone, I guess. Yeah

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:31.080
It was where we could keep the price point super cheap and the target tweens sure that's talk about it was for right

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.290
This is a great example of building something that doesn't yeah building the wrong thing

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:44.520
Right now the if we were part of the business team and doing a retrospective on this

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.420
Right. We would want to go back and go. Okay. What could we if

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.300
We've now learned that the market doesn't want one of these things

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.880
Right. What could we have done earlier?

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.190
to come to the same conclusion

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:08.350
During that time and I ran the last test pass on kin. Yeah, I did not know

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.360
And you're still I didn't just flat out fire the whole team

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.610
That's why I ran the last test pass. Oh because we had

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.440
It was a special deal with Verizon

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:28.780
Verizon wanted had all of this hardware stock and they wanted to to sell it out

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:34.240
And so though yeah after yeah, so they changed they changed some of the software

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.760
To turn it into this is after I mean, this is a product that was out on the market for a week or two

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.760
And then just given up on

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.640
And I want to literally spit state. I literally ran the last test pass

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:54.360
I literally executed the very last set of test cases on this one and this was me as a back then

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.960
I was a test manager

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.060
But it was one of those things where I wasn't going to assign it to one of my ICs

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.960
Not if I wanted to keep them on the team, but what a great example of just shipping the wrong thing

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.040
This is well and that's part of the the learning lessons here

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.360
Is

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.560
We did ship the wrong thing and we spent a lot of costs and if we had gone back and we had said

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.200
Okay, the customer is the only one qualified

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.280
to make a judgment call here, how can we

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.030
How can we test our?

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.030
Hypotheses here

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.030
Much sooner much. Yes

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:39.790
Yes, before going all in on this this is maybe the canonical example of field of dreams engineering

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.150
Yeah

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.670
now there was

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:48.830
We were in transition back in those times a lot of the lot of it was a very

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.110
predictive

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.990
software development

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:58.860
But that doesn't exist anymore. I know well now I did want to merge doesn't need to exist

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:04.220
I think that back we don't have the infrastructure requirements to force a

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:12.570
Get it right the first time when your delivery dates three years from now, right? That's just that's

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:18.250
Foolishness in today's market it is I was just gonna note that it's incredible that

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:24.750
After the failure of kin that Microsoft was able to turn things around to become a world-class phone business

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.660
Yeah

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:33.470
Yeah, you know so I don't have any

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.670
Information here that's not

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:41.230
public knowledge I keep seeing news reports about

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.910
the surface phone

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.600
right, um

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:54.070
And I keep I'm curious about this this one because every time something else comes out. It still does not

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.140
claim

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.140
That the project's been abandoned

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.540
Right and the M. I'm curious about that is like, okay

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.540
so if we're not abandoning it are we going down some sort of intuitive route or

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.780
Have we learned from our our prior mistakes and there we leapfrogging?

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.200
And I really don't know. I don't know either

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:26.000
I did want to there was a little state if I don't think anyone on the business team listens to the podcast

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.080
But pretty sure they don't if they do

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.760
Like if it doesn't directly contain say the Android app store or

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.260
The iPhone app store. Yeah, like what are you doing?

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.620
so I think we've made our point that

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:50.200
Absolutely customers important we as modern testers or people driving modern testing principles need to help our teams figure out

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.480
what customer problems were solving and

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.220
Drive the team in that direction and talk about some different ways we can do that

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.060
Anything else on this topic talk about asking the right questions prioritizing

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:10.900
Treating it as a hypothesis that that your work should prove or disprove

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.770
You can go with a negative aspect and say I'm not going to just trust the requirement

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.790
But you can also think of it from principle number one

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:25.790
Hey, so this requirement stock is a list of someone's

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.230
Hypotheses around how we can build a better business

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.640
principle number one

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.640
test is not just

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.340
Test is no longer just a cost

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:44.100
Reducer no, we're looking at we're also looking at how do we drive revenue?

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.740
Mm-hmm. All right

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.000
so with these hypotheses in play

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.480
Okay, and and with our knowledge of

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.200
What makes customer happy and what solves the customers problems?

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.150
What can we do to?

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:10.270
Prove or disprove these hypotheses and the ones that where we gain knowledge. What can we do to grow those?

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:16.160
The biggest aspect I think of modern testing is they shift to

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.520
being a

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:24.920
More active portion a more active participant in the business and are concerned

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.840
with growing that business

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.640
It's not about

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.840
Preventing customer harm anymore

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:41.140
Certainly, that's important. It's about how do we if the customer is the only one qualified

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.060
to define if it's a

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:50.900
Quality software situation and the quality software situation as we covered here over and over and over again

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.640
Sometimes customers care about bugs. Sometimes they don't

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:03.240
They care about their problem solved. Correct. How do we how do we take that and

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.370
help the business

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:09.990
Grow faster. Yeah, I think its principles a lot about just

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:16.330
Re-emphasizing how important that customer prioritization is in order to make quality software

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:20.250
There's a there's a model a bunch of variations of this that show

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:27.050
The CEO at the bottom and then managers and then individual contributors who are making who are making a lot of decisions

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.210
And then on top of that the customer

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:35.160
Yeah, so the customer leads the way and being able to drive the team towards

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.720
recentering the team I guess would be a good way of putting it of

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:45.360
Continuously recentering the team around the importance of the customer and the importance of solving their problems

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.630
if there's anything around

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.030
This one that I would say we

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:58.040
The test community should walk away with is we are abjectly saying

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.070
No, an end user is

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.520
The single most important in an indirect situation

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:12.400
There may be other people's opinions that are important on if it's a quality but ultimately it's the end user who's benefiting from the

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
From whatever you're producing

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.770
your solution to a problem

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.400
number two test is

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:26.760
Absolutely not a

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:34.140
Representative of the customer they are not the customer. They should stop pretending to be one

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:43.030
For sure. I think we're good. So thanks again for listening. We'll dive into number six next time. I am still Alan

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:48.350
I think I think so too. All right great. Yeah, whatever. See you next time
