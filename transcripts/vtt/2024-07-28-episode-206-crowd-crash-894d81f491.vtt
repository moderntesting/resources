00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.990
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.830
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.150
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show good morning Brent it is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.530
a Sunday good morning Alex did you say Alex no Alex is your kid this is this is

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:41.190
the father and son podcast I am your father Brent you know I'd longtime

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.350
listeners will recall at one time I looked at my 23andMe report and it said

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.790
I had a relative like a distant relative named Brent J and we were afraid for a

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.170
minute but we found out that we are not related although given the obvious

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.570
way that 23andMe can detect exactly but you know given that we're both obviously

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.700
very northern European I'm sure at some point at some point one of our ancestors

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:23.300
probably killed the other one no okay well maybe maybe but not without

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:32.020
contributing to the gene pool first alright you're gonna need to sit up

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.700
and not quite go into total relaxation mode but we I'm gonna blame Rivers but

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.100
actually I'm gonna blame me because Riverside's been rock solid for us and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.580
for some reason Brent and I tried to record on Friday he showed up I showed

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.700
up and either I showed up right after he left because I was like one or two

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.940
minutes late at the most or something didn't connect something was weird but

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.500
I'm gonna blame me so we are here doing our re-recording I'm gonna let you know

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.710
what I did on Friday because it was it was an attempt at something that I will

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.890
never try again I thought you know what you didn't even know Brent doesn't

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.050
Brent doesn't know what happened I thought you know what I listen to a lot

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.490
of podcasts I thought you know what I've been doing this for 200 and some

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.710
episodes I can do this on my own I can record a podcast on my own and I

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.470
attempted to do it and I was able to finish about 15 minutes that's all out of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.790
things to say because I had no one to inspire me or give me dumb things to make

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.870
fun of and I thought about just releasing it I thought you know what I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.260
have enough embarrassing things in my life that I am NOT going to do this so

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.660
it is sitting the mp3 I got as far as making the mp3 it's off my computer it

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.860
will never be released but the topics two of them I have one which you may not

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.100
be able to discuss in which case I will give my monologue again that I

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.540
recorded on Friday and one sort of a question for you and for the listeners

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.290
and probably other stuff going on anyway that's the topic stuff but we haven't

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.210
done the shenanigans portion of the podcast yet so Brent what's new in your

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.930
world anything new and exciting anything fun coming up any enjoying the I don't

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.950
know weather seafare Seattle stuff like what's going on man yeah yeah the parade

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:48.260
was yesterday normally I am able to tell the seafarers happening because right

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.580
really loud ancient aircraft I think they come next weekend I think it's a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.300
sea-fare week so that the parade was yesterday there's a whole week of stuff

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.100
and there's loud boats on the lake and loud airplanes overhead that's all coming

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.280
up have you ever gone to watch the hydroplane races no never I ever in my

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:20.450
life did that once it was exciting and I think once is enough all right yeah yeah

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:37.180
cool man the biggest new thing is yeah oh you mentioned that yay you know yeah I

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.820
just re-orged my team as well wait they don't know it yet crap good good thing

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.980
they don't listen but I tell them all the time and I'll get back to your story

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.740
minute this podcast is really about me why you're here because I need you but

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.100
as as you know see prior my life I think to me and I believe in this story and

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.180
I try and convince people of this you reorg because you're adapting to change

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.620
and we should always adapt to change priorities change you get better the

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.780
goal of a reorg is on the other side to end up being more productive and

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.040
efficient for your customers but it's maybe yours didn't work out that way what

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:30.710
kind of fun story it remains to be seen right so I'll put it this way either in

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.980
my view you either reorg to go on offense which is my sort of

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.700
interpretation of what you were saying right or you reorg to gain efficiencies

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:52.810
right and Microsoft like the efficiency motto would be you know the elimination

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:01.110
of duplication of work right there is an opportunity for it to be the former

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:09.360
right now as best as I can tell it is absolutely the latter so we'll see what

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.040
happens I think there is also and you're a long way from the microphone again I

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.480
think there is also defensive reorg and I'll give you an example of this when I

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.760
if you remember back to I worked at a company called unity for quite a while I

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.660
had a very large documentation org reporting to me for a while they just

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:38.580
for many many very good reasons great folks before I left as we were going

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.500
through rounds and rounds of layoffs rather than half and there's lots of

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.260
advantages having a central org it's all central versus federated things

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.040
central versus federated so I had a central org of a bunch of dock riders and

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.680
I was trying to protect their jobs so I reorg to them back into the product

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.550
units it's a lot harder to lay off onesie twosie writers who are in a team

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.070
that needs documentation than it is to look at an org of 50 people and go

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.110
yeah we can cut 10 or 20 percent off of that so you can do a defensive reorg as

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.550
well maybe that's offensive maybe it's defensive I don't know I don't know how

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.750
well it worked I didn't I didn't put tracking tags on everyone to see where

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:26.150
they ended up but that was yeah I still think there was a strategy there yeah

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:33.830
that that actually is an excellent strategy like I was sharing with one of

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:39.810
my peers the other day right this general tendency you mentioned make

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:47.730
centralized or federated and to me it is it is constantly a pendulum that is just

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:59.720
swinging back and forth and adds in sort of a hamster wheel style infinite loop

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:05.370
yeah and I could I could go into the history of it but I don't know that well

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.250
we have it a more important thing to talk about yeah you can't talk about but

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.370
I guess the thing I say is what I've settled on is a central org versus fully

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.210
federated and I really believe it's the it's the central government and

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.970
Federation or the satellite model or the hub and spoke you have like for the

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.680
last 10 years or so I've led platform engineering dev productivity whatever you

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.260
want to call it central orgs that help people deliver their software better what

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.550
I found and even at Unity this was true is as an organization gets complex and

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:45.600
they have specific needs having folks embedded in the org with that expertise

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.120
to help them with maybe a complicated CI pipeline or complicated deployment

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.280
strategy is actually a really good way to work as long as they're connected

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.240
well as long as it isn't completely disconnected I think having the central

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.680
org is good for general things but having a little bit of specialty within

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:12.220
those orgs is beneficial as well I I have a variant of that that I think it's a

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:19.820
variant of it that that I have found works right the problem with central orgs

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:28.760
if you do not pay attention to them they very quickly try to in order in order to

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:41.580
scale they end up being platform place and and they provide a platform and they

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:49.700
don't really care about how people use it because right there they're the

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.320
platform and and they'll analyze and they'll realize oh these are the things

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.160
that we need that will solve 80% of everyone's problem of course it doesn't

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.780
solve a hundred percent of anyone's problem and so then that starts creating

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:12.960
conflict between the central org and their consumer sure and in a central org like

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:22.270
this the beginning of the end of the central org is when they stop evaluating

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:30.490
whether or not their customers are intrinsically motivated to continue to

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.570
use absolutely they might be they might be extrinsically motivated there's

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:42.130
always you know threats from God the executive says you must do this or you'll

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.850
come up and why blah blah I think with any sort of organization you can there

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:52.490
are traps around that you can fall into but yeah absolutely successful

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:58.410
whatever you want to call the orgs are successful because they they care

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:05.240
about well accelerating the achievement of quality right and they and they listen

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.000
to their customers they engage with the customers to try and solve customer

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.600
problems where I really see these teams fail is when they go to the field of

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.920
dreams approach I'm gonna build a thing everybody use it and which goes back to

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.960
the pop and die thing even it's true for external customers as well as internal

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.640
customers they don't want software they don't want you to build something for

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:31.240
them they want their problem solved right so it's just like delivering a product

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.750
to a customer if once you cease to care about the customer then your your path

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:47.430
to failure is quick right and rightfully so I would say okay there's some so

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.710
speaking of speaking of customers some things some things that we have like

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:55.950
you speaking of customers speaking of customers I'm gonna transition into a

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.710
topic here that I don't know if you can talk about and didn't ask you ahead of

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:04.230
time but I'm gonna talk about it and you can be very quiet if you need to be so I

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:11.570
would like to talk for a bit about CrowdStrike okay and you you can

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.610
contribute as much or as little as you want giving your situation because I

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.810
think CrowdStrike made a mistake a learnable mistake and probably a

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:26.320
careless mistake and given what I read so far but also given my actually go

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:34.200
ahead and say I'll okay but given my experience and my thoughts on this my

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.160
opinion is that Microsoft takes a huge amount of the blame here as well and

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.720
windows at least let me tell you why let me tell you the reflections that went

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.030
through my head as I started learning more about this as I was getting

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:54.710
bombarded last Friday with how many windows machines are affected all of them

00:12:54.710 --> 00:13:03.760
how many is that this many how many are not all I don't know it's not all of them

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:13.040
almost all of them okay all of them that use CrowdStrike for security yes which

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.280
included all of our windows VMs run on the cloud which is a pain in the butt

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.520
to go fix so anyway all of okay all of your yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:30.000
anyway but yes people know about this they're going to fix it so let me go

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.200
back in time a long time ago I've written Windows drivers I wrote a Windows

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.280
driver for I'm very familiar with the model I wrote a code coverage driver for

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.320
Xbox one that allowed code coverage to run from the moment the system booted

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.600
gave me code coverage on almost every single binary in the system which was

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.680
really cool so I'm familiar with how that works that's all great but even

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.480
going back farther that was mere 10 years ago 20 years ago maybe longer ago

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:03.890
I actually wrote some some tests that went into Windows hardware quality labs

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:09.650
also known as wiggle and the idea is and Microsoft got really smart in the

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.530
old days of Windows bad drivers would crash the whole system people would

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.080
freak out sorry for the history lesson here Brent you know all this they moved

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.840
some drivers into user mode which was great but one thing we found out talking

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:33.720
to the wiggle guys back in the day was they would get a driver for I'll just

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.360
say a video card for example maybe a very popular one and in those days you

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.000
know benchmarks were everything people want to see the benchmarks on the

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.600
video card so the driver would come into wiggle it would pass all of its tests it

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.320
would go out to the market and pass all tests to get signed and the and the idea

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.040
behind signing is that binary that was tested was the exact same binary that

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.650
went on to customer machines so this binary go out into the wild and

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:07.870
benchmarks would be fantastic but it would start crashing at you're not like

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.310
every boot or anything but at frequent rates that were never not seen at all in

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:19.890
the wiggle testing and it turns out that there was a nice little workaround

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.010
vendors are very good at finding these work around in the system what this

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:27.730
particular vendor did was they had a registry setting that was set during

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.490
installation to consumer devices that enabled that driver to run different

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.330
code paths and ran in the wiggle setting so essentially with a different

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.690
binary but it was binary compatible so it was signed and it was all good

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:45.690
20 years ago Microsoft was good with that and I don't know if if a Microsoft

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:51.570
exec was yelling at a for example Nvidia exec at the time about this but it was

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:58.290
never stopped if you look at what happened with CrowdStrike their driver

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.930
didn't change they updated a channel file configuration file a file with some

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:10.180
code in it that the driver executed error checking wasn't sufficient and

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:17.640
reading that code caused systems to crash so I would say for 20 years now

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:27.030
Microsoft has of course yeah yeah yeah because there was no code there but

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:35.920
Microsoft has been pretty lenient around letting people work around the

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.070
work around all the work they've done to make the kernel more stable they've

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:47.350
done that then there's been a very high trust to do no harm enabling from

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.230
Microsoft to enable people to do things like this and again with good

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:57.560
intent and trust like they got to get these channel files out faster than

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:05.620
something can get through testing and signings yet with that trust should come

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.260
some level of rigor or over the error checking this should be fuzzing if we

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.580
know the channel files those should be fuzzed to crap and tested as part of

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.700
the wiggle test and that didn't happen on the Microsoft side so in my opinion

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.220
and I'm curious on your take and you can say or you can just say past next

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.900
topic I really believe this scenario was enabled by Microsoft allowing for 20

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:33.660
years driver vendors to work around to easily work around the rigor that's been

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:46.160
put into the kernel to make it more stable so part of what you say I agree

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:55.680
with right in terms of an internally right everything that we've talked about

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:04.280
or that you've talked about is true the channel files though are deployed

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:11.990
through a pipeline not in our control right right and that goes back to yet

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:19.550
there's a trust element there right but but it would literally be by design

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.310
right now the question is of course whether or not that design should

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:32.030
change right there is because particularly in the security space right

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:38.350
so cross right job is to is to defend against hacker attacks which are

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:44.590
literally happening all over the world all of the time yes and yet I'll point

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:50.750
out that what they instigated was the worst-case scenario from any potential

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:56.730
hacker attack therefore invalidating the bulk of what they do oh for sure right

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:03.960
you you essentially have one of the world's largest security companies

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:10.990
literally successfully implementing a DDoS attack against all of its customer

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:22.550
base and wild world right the in right this goes we think about how we talked

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:29.160
about in the last episode around the AI apocalypse right it is something like

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.000
what just happened where the AI apocalypse will occur right as I said

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:44.180
last time the road to hell is paved on good intentions so I will say no right in

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.500
terms of our infrastructure and everything it was one hundred percent

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:54.620
crowd strike to blame now can Microsoft do something to prevent this from

00:19:54.620 --> 00:20:01.840
happening in the future and we're a huge part of the solution right now

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.350
right where we're on calls with customers all the time we've gone through and

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:13.800
manually done the mitigations to to bring customer beings back online

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:23.080
hopefully your company is part of that now the question is okay do we need to do

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:32.560
we need to revisit this old policy and I'm gonna leave that one to two people

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:38.240
smarter than me in this space sure but I think about okay how do we how do we

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.760
strike a balance we don't we don't want to deploy these things through you know

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.080
a painful right they have I totally get it they have to go out very fast and I

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.680
think a lot of the and again I'm one voice who it really pissed me off the

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.280
most about crowd strike where the 10,000 people saying they knew exactly

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.480
what to do so I don't claim to know exactly what to do but having worked on

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.280
Windows I solved the problem like this there's a very rigorous driver safety

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.120
model I'll call it implemented by Microsoft and there are ways to work

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.040
around that that are well known by Microsoft and the vendors so I don't

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:20.000
think it's any secret to Microsoft that this particular driver read code

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.400
that it would run from a file what do we learn about data inputs we sanitize

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.000
and fuzz our freaking inputs so why from the Microsoft side why did they knew this

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.600
was going on so in their validation of the driver why did they not fuzz inputs

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:44.070
to check the error correction in that driver so and you don't you don't know

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.460
you don't have to ask all leave that rhetorical but it's a no but the

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:55.110
problem is is the driver runs in kernel mode right and so by definition because

00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:06.960
the driver is is declared as safe right it's a different thing but maybe it

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.890
should be hey if you deploy files you don't deploy code right but even then

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:18.730
even if you have a config setting that says hey go access address is zero right

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:23.490
you're still gonna blow up no what I'm saying is if I'm the author of a

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:28.250
kernel mode driver in Windows and I again I don't know who should have done

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:34.490
this fuzzing and you know there there's a there's some I'll call it blame but some

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:43.120
some mention of the testing framework on the CrowdStrike side but who like the

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.480
error checking wasn't there you know you know you check if if this pointer

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.000
is null you you error out you don't do anything you don't read the file like

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.850
it might again I don't know all the details but in my driver code if I'm

00:22:54.850 --> 00:23:00.240
gonna go read code to run from a file I'm gonna validate that it's a valid

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:07.200
pointer before I go execute that code so you may my question is that a crowd strike

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.240
to do it but should Microsoft's driver testing for that signed driver included

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:26.010
fuzzing for input files I'm gonna say probably right I would like to

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.650
understand more of the city I know we don't know all that all I'm saying is

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:35.290
Microsoft has allowed people to use these workarounds forever and in doing so

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:39.850
they had an obligation to attempt to make sure that they're not doing anything

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:45.010
incredibly stupid with that path now in the Nvidia case oh I guess I said who

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:49.490
it was in the in the video driver case where you're just executing different

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.980
code paths based on a registry setting that's actually even harder that

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.300
that's you can't there's no fuzz tests gonna go figure out okay you're

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.740
whatever here and that's probably why you know bulk of video drivers and then

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.820
moved into user mode and windows because it gives them a little bit more robustness

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:19.070
but they are set anyway I it brought back a lot of driver memory to spend

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:24.190
a chunk of my chunk of my life there and it made me think so you you brought

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.190
up the AI apocalypse and I don't know actually before we go on I had a segue

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:33.610
there which was going to be rough but thanks for listening actually this is

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:38.810
way better as a discussion than me attempting to sound like an actual

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.610
podcast or talking about it so but thanks for walking through disagreeing

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.370
and agreeing etc etc but anymore you know I said what I wanted to say on

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:58.280
this but anything else you want to add no no like I said like I am highly

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:05.320
confident that the windows team I this is I don't know right but I do know for

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:12.840
example Satya is on is on calls on a daily basis right we are absolutely part

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.470
of the solution if there is something that we can and should do that is that

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:25.990
will help to prevent this in the future I am highly confident we will do it I am

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.630
not at a place I'm nowhere near that organization so I'm not a place yeah no

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.710
no I told all the community like the thousands of other people on the

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.710
internet who think they have the exact solution all we can do is hypothesize I

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:47.510
do know right so one of our major mantras is within within manager is we are

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:54.870
built on trust so in some regards whether or not we had a part to play is

00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:00.690
kind of irrelevant right we will have to take action yeah because we cannot have

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:12.600
like third-party systems taking out exactly exactly that yeah great it's

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:17.720
interesting like one one malicious individual hacks in the crowd strike but

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.600
would be learned oh they have the ability to take out the world neat that's

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.920
neat yeah that's neat that's neat yeah okay it gives you an idea of the extent

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.120
of what an actual good attack not prevented by counts crowd strike can do

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.940
it's just unfortunate that this was the company that did it and they'll recover

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.820
you know if you look at either her this on the pivot podcast which are

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:52.180
highly recommend their stock is down like 15% since the thing but still up 25%

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:58.550
for the year so it doesn't really it hasn't had a big monetary effect on

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:05.030
them it won't tell Microsoft either people are gonna still keep buying

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.830
windows we're gonna pay for our windows licenses running in the cloud

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.790
you're gonna make some dollars and you're gonna be rich so AI apocalypse

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:17.590
we talked about last time I I think I called the episode we're afraid of AI

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:25.220
now you can I can I add one thing I don't know that a lot of so I have my

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.740
intern left on Friday and he I mean was it was at the end of their rotation or

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:35.320
they just get fed up and leave it was little of both little fine okay go on

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:43.120
no no damn you out I actually so this particular case the the interns like

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.320
you're the best manager of the place so f you and the horse you wrote it on now

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:54.040
so we came in I normally work from home on Fridays but I came in because I

00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:01.170
wasn't gonna miss my intern leaving and the conversation came in to quantum

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.130
computing because one of the things that he's working on he's pursuing a

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:13.670
PhD in cybersecurity and one of the things he's working on is a technology

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:23.960
where everything can prove whether or not the output came from that subsystem

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:30.440
like oh this application I can prove that this output came from that

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:39.040
application it smart thing and then one of my employees was like yeah but that's

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:46.350
all worthless once once we can commercialize quantum computing and I'm

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:52.800
like and I don't know if you know much about quantum computing but once it

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.440
comes out and once it's available broadly it's very well known that pretty

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.070
much all encryption is dead mm-hmm right and then I connected dots in that

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:10.980
meeting I'm like oh neat we got open AI trying to build AGI in 10 years and at

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:16.740
the same time quantum computing is progressing oh I wonder how how much

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:23.090
time it'll take before these two connect together and make sweet little skynet

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:34.770
not much time the end is near yeah I'm like oh yeah fine so you I'm gonna get to my

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.890
other topic in a minute here yeah maybe think of two things one is one of the cool

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.130
things and Microsoft should steal this by the way because this is actually one

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:47.360
of the best programs I don't know of existing anywhere else we have a

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:54.500
program at I work at a small media company called NBC Universal if you

00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:01.700
haven't heard of it they do things like the Olympics yeah so we have a program

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.060
called the media tech program and you know at Microsoft we hired a lot out of

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:10.780
college and Unity did not I did some of the first college hiring done there

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.580
and I've hired a lot of new folks into brand new roles in NBC but we have

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.460
this really cool program called the media tech program which what it is is

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:24.000
we hire new grads and rather than put them on a team where they will live

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.200
forever you know the stories of Microsoft someone joins the office team

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.400
when they're 22 and 50 years later they leave the office team this media tech

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:38.000
program is a purposeful rotation when you're hired as a media tech you do

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.120
three eight-month rotations on three different teams and if you think back

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.720
to the beginning of your career it took us a long time to settle into something

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:57.500
like okay this is my niche and it gives these kids get off my lot I'm an old man

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:04.100
it gives these kids a great opportunity to kind of see what they like and you know

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.500
some have gone through gone through rotations and wanted to come back to our

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.660
team some help them find like somebody says I've done these things what else

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.380
can I look at it's a really cool way to kind of get your career started not

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.660
kind of it's a really cool way to get your career started and you should steal

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.060
that from Microsoft I think it's great that's one of the things they

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.900
Microsoft should have done this because Microsoft does so much college

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:32.570
level hiring and we try and we place people we when I was there we place

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:36.690
people best guess but why not do a forced rotation I think it's a really cool

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.730
program so that's the one thing based on your intern I wanted to mention but

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.970
you mentioned something else and I have a really hard time with this so there's

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:49.610
a story involved here actually there's been a couple times I'm not telling the

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.490
story very well but you mentioned your intern liked you and thank you for

00:31:52.490 --> 00:32:00.720
being a great leader and like like I don't take compliments well as it is but

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.520
I just feel really awkward and weird when someone tells me oh you've been a

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.440
great manager Eric like we just read I just wrote a blog post about this you

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.040
probably have a chance to read it yet because I literally posted it like as

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.040
you were messaging me to say hey can we do a podcast now one of the things that

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.840
pisses me off about accelerate is there's a book here with all kinds of

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.360
great ideas and people focus on one chapter oh the four metrics we've got to

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.240
go measure these and we have a little book club at work and we talked about

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.120
the just finished the last three chapters of the main book which are

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.720
about employee engagement sustainability and leadership and management and there's

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.800
so much good information on there on how to make good organizations and

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.160
people focus on the damn metrics versus actually trying to build a good like this

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.440
is this is all from the same book it's all good information you can do both it

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.400
pisses me off but one of the one of my employees in the group you know they

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.600
got the chapter on leadership and I felt awkward because I was the leader there

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.760
and then they gave me praise and I don't know how do you deal with this as

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.600
a side note is it just me or does it make you feel like I don't know what to

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:13.960
say to this I'm wondering if it's an INTP thing so maybe maybe it's just an eye

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:21.420
thing like I like you know I I'm happy when you are engaged and get results but

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.820
please don't when you attribute it to me no matter how much I try and make the

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.260
the environment for you to be successful if you attribute it to me I feel really

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:40.210
weird I so I'm not gonna read what my intern said to me okay but I will read

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:48.560
my response I said thank you for the very kind words it's interesting your

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:57.860
perspective about me and it is not one I share of myself but I will definitely

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:04.260
strive to be the manager you see oh my god yeah yeah I usually say things I

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.220
say like usually a thanks this is really nice to say that's so much of the kind

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:13.820
of words and this is what I try to do but I'm not all I can't I can't just take

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.440
us it I we have a long way to go or I'm working on working on this a lot I'm

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:27.310
glad you recognize it or it's just weird but here's here's um I don't know if

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:33.630
anyone if anyone in our audience is considering or currently going through

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:42.320
either a master's or a PhD in psychology right I doubt any of that is the case but

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:51.320
to me like I have a strong hypothesis that the best people managers are one

00:34:51.320 --> 00:35:03.180
with a measurable degree of self-esteem issues oh that must make me awesome

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:18.960
right no because I just think about maybe make it it would come down to like you

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.140
and I are awesome talk are always talking about how things could be made

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:29.440
better right but we haven't got into why do we share that right is it because

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.540
like in my case I see everything including me broken all the time and I

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:39.420
just want it fixed right I think it is a little different you know when I started

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:45.940
reading about and and we can go into this topic I care a lot about engagement

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.160
really came from me reading The Advantage by Pat Lincione when it first

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.200
came out his only book of fiction or nonfiction and based on a lot of his

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.400
studies where I started getting into more and more studies from Gallup and

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:02.600
others showing them the money what's massive correlation what would you call

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.640
is there a word for like their lockstep but between engagement and employee

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:13.560
engagement and delivery and quality and everything that goes well organizational

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:21.360
health is is just tied lockstep to the quality and velocity and delivery

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:27.180
sustainability and of what the team is delivering and that's why and I dug in

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:31.340
and then when I see like I just care about building good orgs and I realized

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.980
I think it was the same conversation but some they asked me like how did you end

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.580
up like maybe it was a different conversation I can't remember someone

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.840
asked me recently how I kind of ended up leading and managing the way I do

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:51.240
and it's a combination of things that I wasn't that same conversation things

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.960
that really pissed me off things I learned from horrible leaders I said I'm

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.160
gonna do the opposite and then a lot of kind of what you're at I have this I

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.040
read so much and try and get so many ideas from books and articles and try

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.880
and absorb these things and try and figure out how I can move things forward

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.580
in the best way because I don't trust myself to figure it out on my own I'm

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.780
not and you and I have both worked for leaders who assume they knew everything

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.340
and I assume I know nothing because that's probably closer to the truth I

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:33.410
love connecting what I'm doing to new ideas yeah so so part of it is is

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:41.440
right if I see a flaw I can go oh I read away the self this particular one

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:49.000
let me let me incorporate that in like it was something that I that you were

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:58.670
saying earlier on right there is a there are a lot of books literature is better

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:06.190
way of saying it that essentially will sum up with happy people are productive

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:14.900
people yeah and it's very strongly correlated from a quantitative point of

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:24.850
view yet that is science stuff can easily get involved here but as a as a

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:37.900
leader you know that happy your people are are doing the work you need them to

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:44.500
do the more productive right the one trade-off is the vibe I've only

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:50.820
encountered a couple times in my career where where right the person's not

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.860
productive because they're not happy because they don't they don't even want

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:05.600
to do the work that we have in it a very a very common example this one

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:12.760
just I was not able to get him to shift his mind the one I'm thinking of anyway

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:20.520
but PhDs when they come come to Microsoft like they still have an academic

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.120
point yeah and we make we make software here not research papers come on

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:37.490
exactly exactly and so so some of them they and I'll say like the like my last

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:46.310
intern he's again PhD pursuing his PhD in cybersecurity and and I said long story

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:53.380
short he knows today that if he can get a job in industry after he gets his PhD

00:39:53.380 --> 00:40:00.340
that's what he's gonna do like he he is an industry guy not but he wants to do

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.980
things not just this not discovered things yeah I want to build on the on the

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.140
happy thing because it's yeah it's not just happy because there's this from Kim

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.620
Scott's work on radical candor if you just make someone happy and I've known

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.460
leaders like this are so afraid to disappoint people if you just make

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:21.160
someone happy just work on making them happy she calls it ruinous empathy

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:26.080
meaning they're not growing they're just happy they're doing whatever they don't

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.960
get feedback if they're not going well we can't do that and I think the

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.000
accountability kind of helps with that but engagement comes from three things

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
people want to know their manager cares about them by finding growth

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.720
opportunities you know and get you know getting to know them etc they want

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.480
to know why their works important they want to feel like the work matters in

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.480
which case they'll like doing the work if they don't understand why they're

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.320
doing what they're doing just to cog in the machine they're not engaged and

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:55.880
they need feedback whether it's continue or praise feedback or hey this is a

00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.800
problem let's work on this together but it's it the studies show that it's so

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.380
freakin easy and even accelerate talked about the same things in different words

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.150
people want to know why their works important they want to have a

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.270
connection with their manager and they want feedback they give them those three

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.070
things and they're going to be happy and they're gonna get work done and

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.950
you're gonna there's of course other things in connecting the org with trust

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.270
and psychological safety that will create that organization that can be

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:30.170
highly effective and healthy but it's not rocket surgery not much to do there so

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:37.970
anyway yeah we're similar that's so I do want an interesting list I it's it's

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:44.480
that's from Gallup it's it's it's real-world stuff hey one last topic

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.160
here oh my god the hour is already up and I want to get your feedback and I

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:54.000
would like the feedback of the three on this you can go to modern testing org and

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
click on the link and you will join our slack group where you can engage with

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.040
Brent or I or the much smarter people who hang out in our slack group about a

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.480
thousand people they're very self-sustaining a lot of folks give

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.040
better answers on a lot of questions and Brent or I can which is great because

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.480
neither one of us have been in testing gay today for a while if you have

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.840
questions about that but anything it's great way to engage people send me DMS

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:24.910
there all the time anyway last time we had the apocalypse and I got of course

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:30.170
like two different emails from people you don't get these I don't think I

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.770
can't remember if I set up a be testing at angry we's calm to go to you as well

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:39.530
or not I don't think I did but I get one to two I should say I would say one to

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:44.570
three requests a week of people saying for various reasons whether it's around

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:51.130
AI or around the real a be testing not our podcast or around whatever I get so

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:57.050
many requests for people to be a guest on our podcast and we don't do guests very

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:02.490
often and I am actually looking for more diverse guests and the generic white

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:10.370
dudes they send me so I ignore them or tell them not to I'm wondering though I'm

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:19.390
wondering and I just like the guests I want ideally have at least listen yeah I

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:24.030
want yes I don't want to come on the podcast just to be able to advertise

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:29.030
right and I and I don't want that and I don't I want people for our podcast that

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:33.290
can you know they've listened to the podcast maybe a different view than we do

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.970
I don't want someone to come on and nod their head I want them to talk about a

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.410
topic that's adjacent to what we're talking about that that we've talked

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:44.090
about that maybe is new and interesting those sorts of guest things that will

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:52.010
bring value to our listeners as the as the as the kids say on YouTube like I'm

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:59.530
open to like a collab yeah but not yeah but I'm half wondering because I get so

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:04.410
many and maybe this is a retirement job for me somewhere along down the line but

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:10.720
I could make a whole other podcast just me interviewing these randos on the

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.680
internet I'll shove some advertising in those and make some cash I don't think

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:21.550
I'm actually gonna do that but I wonder if actually I don't I'm not definitely not

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:30.120
going to do that short term but I do think like maybe that's you know maybe

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.880
maybe I could just do an a rando interview podcast I think it would be a

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:41.200
dead-end but I also listen to so many other podcasts that do poor interviews I

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.520
wonder if we if I tried I could actually do a good one if I had a set of questions

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.960
like the three a b test three for three by the way if you're a listener of the

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.880
podcast and you want to be on a podcast and hang out with me for like 30 minutes

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.710
tops and answer three questions about I think I think I had to set three

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:02.970
questions been so long I forgot them but just contact me on the slack group

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:08.090
or email me or or whatever I would I would love to do more of those things

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:12.050
a great way to get other voices out there quickly it's a really a 30-minute

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:17.710
commitment goes on the same feed people could hear him they could skip him if

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:24.390
they want to but I actually want to do more of those but have you have you do

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:30.210
you spend much time on YouTube have you seen hot ones I haven't seen hot ones but

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:34.070
I did watch Joshua I'm halfway through watching Josh Wiseman's hundred ways

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:38.320
cook an egg that he posted today oh I haven't seen that yeah I just came out

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:44.770
but anyway I do spend time on YouTube yeah all right hot ones essentially the

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:53.810
guy's stick is they have he has five oh this is the wings guy who interviews

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.770
people while he's torturing them with hot sauce I would love to be on that

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:04.810
show I'm not interesting enough to be a guest but I love hot things I do as well

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:20.490
however I'm wondering why don't you take 343 to YouTube oh oh that's a way

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:29.600
better idea than kicking off a rando a rando yeah we interview series yeah so

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.920
even better you can choose you don't want to be on YouTube you don't have to

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:41.130
you but yeah let's do a video interview on YouTube and just the questions you'll

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:46.760
know in advance not gonna try and bamboozle you and I don't have to talk

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.680
much people listen to my stupid voice if you want to get your opinion out

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.280
there and have a couple questions let's do 343 let's put them on YouTube this

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.640
time in fact if you already done one and like Danny thought just posted a

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.960
blog post about how it's been four years since his and what's changed what's the

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.320
same etc you know if you've been on one before you want to redo it let's do that

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.410
I don't sell stuff sell yourself you can sell yourself you can't sell your

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.650
stuff I'll ask a question about what you're doing I could redo people we can

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:19.130
do like we could have like a channel ooh okay thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:24.290
yeah I'm into it again let us know what you think if you're interested I will

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:28.770
want to get I don't want to do one so it'd be good to get a couple people

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:36.950
interested if we're gonna do that again but yeah cool all right we we we gotta

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:43.070
get Alan to do this and then we got to get him to a million subscribers okay I

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:50.070
be I'd be good with ten so we get each of the three and then each of the three

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:58.910
gets you know what is it do the math right yeah yeah

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:05.870
a free gift something something yeah we should do that all right um I think

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.710
that's it for my topics for today anything else you want to add before we

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:16.880
close it out no this is fun all right Brad thanks for hanging out with me thanks

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:24.240
all you three for listening and we'll do this again soon
