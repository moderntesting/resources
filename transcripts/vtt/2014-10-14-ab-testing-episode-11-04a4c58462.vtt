00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.550
Hey everybody, I'm Alan.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.550
I'm Brent.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.190
And we're back for another episode of AEG Test Aid.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.190
For those keeping count, number 11.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.190
Whoa, 11.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.190
That's so cool.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.190
We're a prime number.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.220
That's awesome.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.220
Woo hoo.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.940
Alright, so, gosh, we have an agenda.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.100
We have a list on the board, so we're working through it.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.500
Last week, I did a post on, like I called it something stupid, like the myth of technical

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
interviews.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.840
And it was sparked off.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.640
I saw a tweet, an article was written about a bunch of big data analysis on Google's interview

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640
data.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.680
Okay.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.920
And they wanted to see what's the correlation of who are the best interviewers at finding

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.520
good hires, how much does the interview feedback overall reflect their future success at Google.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.940
And the answer is there is absolutely zero correlation.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.300
With the Google interview?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.180
With the interview feedback, like a person that got the highest interview scores ever,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.520
and a person who barely got in, there was no correlation between who would do better

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520
at Google.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
Doesn't surprise me.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.520
Doesn't surprise me.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.520
It didn't surprise me at all.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520
It was like, duh.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.580
And then I looked in the articles from a couple years ago, but not that, a year and a half

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.020
ago, but not that it makes a huge deal, but.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.500
So Google has also changed their interview strategy recently.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.060
They used to be more of the old school Microsoft, the puzzle questions and such.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.660
Do you know which style this was ranking?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660
It doesn't matter.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.420
And the point that I made in my post is that your interview, I hate to hope I don't break

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.300
anybody's heart for those of you that haven't read my blog posts, but your interview isn't

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.380
going to decide the future success of this person.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.900
Your interview is there to make you interview the person to make sure you don't hire a

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.220
complete total doofus.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.100
You know, one of the better managers in my career, one day to sort of talk me off

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.500
of jumping off a cliff because I was so upset about our interview process.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.580
He basically said two things that that he realized that I hadn't realized before.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.140
And these two things were both the review and the interview process.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.020
Their goal was to solve the same thing.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.860
And that is they weren't there to assure good people move forward.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.140
They were there to assure bad people don't.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.740
Yeah. And that's a much better way to look at it.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.580
And then, you know, at Microsoft, we have really I do three types of interviews at

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.460
Microsoft where we have three types of candidates.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.980
I usually do the as appropriate interview, but three types of candidates at the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.660
college hire. And I want to make sure that, look, the language you learn in

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.540
college, you're probably a program in language you're probably not going to be

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.460
using in five years.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.860
So I don't care what, you know, what sort of trivia you've memorized about

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.260
whatever language you're working with.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.320
But I'll make sure you're a good fit.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.640
And I look at the college hire.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.200
I want to make sure are really I'm making a bet on am I going to invest a

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.680
year's salary and benefits to sort of audition you?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.320
Because are you, you know, are you good enough to get in?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.520
Then there's the industry candidate, which have you I want to figure out, have

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.840
you been faking your way through the industry?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.640
A lot of it's the same.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.440
I want to make sure a year from now, are you going to be, are we going to be

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.720
working on firing you or are you going to still be working here doing a good

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.060
job? And then the one I think we talked, we hinted a little bit about this

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.020
in a mail from our CEO this summer.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.140
There was another hint about this.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.940
There's sort of the internal transfer.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.090
And where we really screw up at Microsoft is, I think, is that we put, we

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.530
interview those three candidates the exact same way.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.850
If someone's already at Microsoft and they've been here for a couple of

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.170
years and you look at like nobody's been trying to fire them for a while.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.210
The main thing I'm going to look at is fit on the team and fit maybe

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.770
some fit for the job and are you going to work well on our team?

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.170
I'm not going to go ask you the same stupid puzzle and programming,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.610
reverse the people on a desert island question that I asked the college

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.890
candidates, it's a waste of time.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.200
So I think I hope we get better at that soon.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.760
Yes.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.000
So the, it's interesting.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.360
I, I have different criteria for, for me, a kid coming in from college.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.920
I only care about one thing.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.560
Yeah, maybe two.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.180
The, the two things then would be, can you learn quickly what we're going

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.620
to teach you over the next year?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.780
Yeah.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.500
That's each one of the things I really look for is sort of that passion

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.700
and ability to learn quickly.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.140
Yes.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.180
And then on the fully agreed, the passion side, can I get a sense of what

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.860
your work ethic is going to be like?

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:59.900
Are you, are you all in on learning how to learn this business?

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.450
That when you first come in from college, like your role is just to pick it up

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.170
and, and I'm overusing the word learn, but to learn, similar to an

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.970
apprenticeship back in the day, we have this ladder level here and I think

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.210
it's still kind of true, although our view view view process is

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.090
differing a great deal.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.410
It used to be, you got hired in at what was known as a level 59.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.690
And I was hired as a level nine.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.300
I was hired as a 10.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.780
Yeah.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.580
Long time ago.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.740
Different level system.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.140
Yeah.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.220
We changed it quite a bit.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:45.660
Uh, but a 59, if you were still a 59, even 60 or 18 months later,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.710
uh, alarm ball or alarm bells went off.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.550
Or the alarm balls, which are a little worse.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.230
They can be, yes.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.730
They're, they're spiky and mischievous.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:04.700
Um, because we have a concern that first year is kind of viewed as an investment.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.540
That's what I said.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.060
It's I said, it's an audition.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.580
Yeah.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.900
Um, or, or an apprenticeship of sorts.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.220
Sure.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.180
Uh, apprenticeship is probably better, but yeah.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.740
Yeah.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.900
Um, you know, the, the, the internal candidate, there's really only one thing

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.900
I care about, like I, I can, I can figure out what your skills are from, from the,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.780
from looking at your past reviews.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.780
I can see depending on your ladder level, like the, there's going to be a

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.590
balance between, um, requirements around communication or requirements around

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.190
leadership or technical requirements, but I only care about one thing ultimately.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.590
And that's group fit.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.770
Yeah.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.680
And one other thing I realized I would do differently is that, you know, group fit.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.440
I, I talked to the candidate about that.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.840
Maybe have them talk to somebody on the team and also remember sometimes are,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.330
and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that sometimes our managers can get

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.310
a little bit full of themselves and focus too much on interviewing the candidate

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.510
and not realizing if you're trying to bring in someone to your team, they

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.230
need to interview you as well.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.470
When I, when I go on a job interview at Microsoft, I want to make sure that I

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.630
feel like I fit on the team.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.910
I feel like I'm going to be challenged and I'm going to learn that I'm going

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.590
to have the opportunities that I'm looking for.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.710
And I think a lot of times, uh, you know, when you look at a internal hiring

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.390
loop, it's all about, can they pass our gauntlet?

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.030
Can we make them sweat and squirm?

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.230
And, and really for someone internal, I think that's just crap.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.520
It, there is a situation where it could be non crap.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:48.400
And that is if the team is, is, is in a constant fire drill mode, right?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.000
They don't want to hire someone who who's going to consistently crumble under stress.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.520
Well, good.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.160
Because as I might, as I'm interviewing a team, I'm interviewing to be on a team

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.120
and I can tell they're in constant fire drill mode, unless they, unless they

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.800
are hiring me to come in and fix that, it's not a team I'm going to be on.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.880
They're not going to, they're not going to pass my interview.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.840
No, the, the other thing.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.720
Um, so there, there have been several interviews I've been on several.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.600
I've passed and several I've failed.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.760
Uh, in, in recent past though, um, thankfully due to, due to my experience

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.480
here, I usually end up being interviewed by the, the higher level guys who, who

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.360
spend a lot of time doing group fit.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.440
And I'm actually appreciative.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.590
Um, when I can tell that they're sort of doing a group fit analysis in terms

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:42.390
of like the type of questions they ask me, if I ultimately get a, a, a no hire.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:48.310
Uh, I'm very happy for that because that absolutely that's leveraging their

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.310
knowledge to go, no, this is not the right place.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.550
I don't view good guy, not the right guy.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.470
I don't view a failing an interview as a fail.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.550
I view it as a, whoo, that's a whole lot of pain in my life.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.750
That's not going to happen now.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.270
Yeah.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.230
And I think that's a good way to come out of that.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.950
I've, I've experienced that myself.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.190
As a hiring manager, if I'm hiring internal, and then we're going to move

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.270
on from the subject for, I know we have a lot of Microsoft internal listeners,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:18.190
but if I'm a hiring manager and hiring someone eternal from Microsoft

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.890
to be on my team, uh, again, I'm gonna look at them for fit, but really

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.730
the way I want to find out if they could do the job is it's not going

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.490
to come out from the interview.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.210
I want to talk to their, you know, this is hard at Microsoft because

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.970
we have interviews sort of like, just like, oh, I'm leaving the team, but

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.090
I want to talk to the team they were on.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.690
At least, at least their current manager, if not a teammate or two, just to see,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.450
uh, what have they done?

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.770
Are they BS and they're good?

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.890
And I would expect, and, uh, as my manager would do today, I guarantee it.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.190
Um, if I were to interview for another job at Microsoft, he would proactively

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.100
call the other manager and tell them, uh, I think good things, but you know,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.900
he, he watches out for me.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.880
He's a very much a, uh, I'm going to make sure you do all right, no matter

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.520
where you are, and I think, uh, we need more managers like that.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.890
More managers who, who, who cover their, their person's butt.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:18.010
It's making, no, it's making sure that, uh, they're about fit, making sure

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.690
the hiring manager knows what you're good at.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.170
If you're thinking to hire this person, here's what they're good at.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.170
Here's what they're going to do for you.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.890
Here's the things you need to work with them on.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.850
Here's, I think that conversation between hiring managers, hiring

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.290
manager and current manager, uh, not just a quick phone chat.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.290
Hey, I'm poaching your dude, but a good conversation around, uh, capabilities,

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.610
limitations, et cetera is, uh, essential for a good internal transfer.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.690
I, so I've, I've been the hiring manager that makes those calls quite often.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.770
And over the years, I found it almost totally useless.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.570
I think cause a lot of times what I've seen is it becomes a it's polarizing.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.250
It becomes a confirmatory chat.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.090
Hey, I'm poaching your dude.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.210
Anything I should worry about.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.500
And they go, no, just take him.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:02.900
Yeah.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.700
He sucks.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.660
Well, whatever.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.700
What, what are you going to do?

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.780
Well, if I say he's bad, you're going to hire him anyway.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.180
It's that, it's that trust and honesty is missing.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.700
Yeah.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.620
So that ends up being a BS conversation.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.060
There's, there's two reasons why I don't really use so much.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.980
Number one, we have so much stuff documented in, in the review process.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.980
So when I have a candidate coming in and he's interviewing, I get to see the reviews.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.100
I haven't, I haven't done this since the review switched over.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.820
But the peer feedback, I'm hoping I have access to that.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.180
Yeah.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.540
Peer feedback would help a lot.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.580
I think often you can't, as much as you want to trust, can't much as you don't

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.900
want to trust talking to that manager.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.380
Often it's hard to tell what's going on from the review documents I've seen as

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.540
well, but the peer feedback, I think is a little bit, we need to take that a

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.700
little bit more seriously here.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.180
I think it's a much better read on who and how a person, who a person is and

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:54.780
how they work.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.500
I want to talk about just, I know we've beat the crap, the heck out of

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.760
this subject, but I want to throw a, something I read over the interwebs

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.920
recently and see what you think.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.080
Uh, Brett and I have talked a lot about what the engineering team or as

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.480
Microsoft likes to call it the combined engineering team, how that works, et

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.640
cetera, blah, blah, blah.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.800
Not going to bore you with a rehash, but I saw somewhere, someone said

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.640
something to the effect of if you don't have a test team, you're not

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.160
taking product quality seriously.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.320
I'm curious what you have to say about it.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:34.760
You just say a test team, a test team, test team, a team of people responsible

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.440
for testing quality into the product.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.280
I, that last part wasn't there a team responsible for testing.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.840
I would say, yes, I agree.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:49.200
We, this horse, this horse, I'm not only dead, time out, time out, time out.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.400
You, you agree the horse is dead.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.520
You don't agree that to be clear.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.880
Do you agree?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.500
Are you saying that without a team for testing software in your software

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.020
development organization, you cannot make a quality product?

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.650
I would agree that that is the correct principle for all of our competitors.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.470
No, not the ones that are beating us.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:17.030
Uh, the ones, the ones that are beating us should absolutely, uh, take

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.350
this insight and go with it a hundred, a hundred miles an hour.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.990
This is stupid.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.780
The, the, the,

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.770
someone's going to do an edit where they make you sound really stupid and it

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.170
could be the person staring at the laptop right now.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:39.090
This, uh, episode 12, the all outtakes episode.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.730
Yeah.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.550
Where to start with this.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.000
I've, I've begun to encounter, um, more of this.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.920
Here's another horse we beat dead.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:55.650
So there was a situation that incurred in my life very recently where, um,

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:02.880
my manager recommended someone else come and talk to me, uh, because

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.990
relatively speaking, I am now an expert in agile.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.000
This guy was trying to invent his own version of agile fragile.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.790
That's what it's, that's what it is currently.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:23.340
And this guy told my manager, I have been in this industry for 20 years.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.020
I know what I'm doing.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.930
And this coupled with what you say, right?

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.650
It reminds me of something that I now call Jensen's rule of politics,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.080
which is he who is defensive loses always.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.160
So I think the comment that you're talking about is somebody who's, who's

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.520
either completely not paying attention to the industry or is paying attention

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:58.450
to the industry and is being defensive around how to continue to

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.130
justify their existence.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.850
I think that's a lot to do with it.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.290
And I also think that once you see something done wrong, and we've talked

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.410
about, we've beat the heck out of the dead horse of how to do a engineering

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.610
team wrong where you don't have any test specialists.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.810
Um, see if you see that you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.810
But, um, the efficiency gains from having that combined team and having

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.090
the test specialists who can do the things that some of the really great

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.210
testers do on an engineering team.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.690
Totally essential.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:31.810
But I think, uh, often I see a lot of maybe since I look at testing articles

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:37.890
and blogs and, and tweeters most often, but the level of cynicism on, I've

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.090
seen that not work once, so it never works.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.930
And it's bad is just off the charts.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.730
Like your iOS, um, bug last last podcast.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.650
The, this is look, Alan.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.010
I'm looking.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.660
I, I think this topic needs to be done.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.140
All right.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:57.660
Done with it.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.230
Now, I don't necessarily mean here.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:06.610
Like my response to a tweet like that would be good luck with that.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.330
Yep.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.770
Right.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.930
That, that battle is over.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:15.890
You got some guy who's blind still swinging the sword around and it's over.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:16.370
Yeah.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.740
And I think, I think a lot of, there's a lot across the industry.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.220
People started figuring this out and figuring out what this looks like.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.300
And there's the growing pains and why I've seen it not work here.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.060
And I've seen this work here and it works for me, but it won't work for me.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.620
Um, but I think the battles, it's just the, we're dealing with casualties

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.060
and growth and people figuring out what their role is in the new world.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.900
And that's fine.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.660
And, and, uh, I wrote a blog post.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.060
Uh, you haven't written a blog post in a long time, by the way.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.380
Yeah, I know school, school and work is, is just slowing me down.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.460
Um, I have one half written it'll go out this week.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.620
Um, so those who, who are paying attention to that other than that one, which

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.300
I think is our three listeners, maybe, um, I'll have another one out this week.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:11.180
But, um, about two years ago to wrote a blog post and there's, there's a,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.520
you can go to monster jobs and search for cobalt, right?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.560
There are still jobs for cobalt.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.480
So, so people who hold this point of view that there still needs to be a test team.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.800
Yeah, that's true.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.960
There's going to be companies that, that believe that, but that's going to

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.440
rapidly orders of magnitude accelerate to be the opposite point of time out.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.160
There is absolutely nothing that says you cannot do full on XP with cobalt.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:46.430
The language, the language is not, does not dictate the engineering approach.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:52.790
No, what I'm saying is, is right back when Alan was born cobalt was an

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:59.230
important popular language and it's, it's, it's still important, but it is not

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.670
where people go like worldwide.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:06.910
When I last did this query, there was like 6,000 job openings for cobalt.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:12.790
And there was something close to 30 to 40,000 job openings for C sharp.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:18.320
Um, it's just not the way the, the, the world is spinning.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.850
I've been programming in cobalt for 20 years.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.210
I think I know what I'm doing.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:23.730
Right.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.810
Good luck with that.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.290
Fortran.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.130
All right.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.090
So let's move on from that and hopefully not have to revisit that unless someone,

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.570
uh, you know, writes something clever in the mailbag.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.180
So Brett and I have talked a lot about data-driven quality,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.380
data-driven culture.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.700
What's your latest thoughts on sort of what, what does that mean to be,

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.340
to have a data-driven culture on your team?

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.740
So we are actually, my, my team right now is going through a process where we're

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:56.260
trying to accelerate, um, the training of the program management work.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.690
And the way I would say, um, data-driven culture, they're there.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:09.530
The way I would address that is those who are still using their intuition.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:16.050
Intuition is, is good, but a data-driven culture is one where people are

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:24.500
constantly validating their intuition with facts and using that new knowledge

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:31.160
to pivot the direction of either their feature or their product or

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.840
whatever it is that they're working on.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.730
We're going to use facts to make decisions.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:37.210
Whoa.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.220
Um, yes.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.290
Unless, unless data means something else to you, Alan, what do you think?

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.650
Um, I'm just teasing you.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.810
I want to rewind and then we'll get back to data culture.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.850
Cause as you know, nothing is linear in the world of AB testing,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.610
at least for Brett and Alan's version.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.770
Training your PMs.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:56.250
Yeah.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.610
What are you training your PMs on?

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.410
Oh, this, I don't think I've shared this with you.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.850
You'll think this, I think you'll think this is cool.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:09.490
This, this is sort of a progression of how, uh, I think Microsoft is going to start.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.770
Is it wax on wax off on your cars?

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.010
No, no, no.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:20.780
So my team, we have a kick ass VP, uh, who grew up in the startup world.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:31.050
And he was hired into this company as, as a senior exec to help bring that culture here.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:38.790
Um, one of the things that, uh, me and a partner of mine have done in the last

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:47.900
two months is we are routing our instrumentation to a third party and this

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:57.570
third party site, they have mastered the art of, um, first off their schema policy.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.890
Their API is fantastic.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.290
And they have mastered their market is usage analytics.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.200
So instead of us having to go through and, um, uh, like every other team at

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.960
Microsoft is doing right now is creating their own data pipeline and creating their

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.720
own cubes and doing their own insight discovery.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.720
These guys know what they're looking for.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.400
They have an API that says, send it this way.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.880
We will automate it.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:34.270
And, um, our PMs can now go to the site and see all kinds of fun, interesting data

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.630
that they didn't see before.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:41.180
Now, what we're doing is we're getting the PMs in the room.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.420
We're hand holding them through how to use the site and sort of what sort of

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.980
insights you can pick up from it.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:58.330
And I have never seen such amount of, uh, wide eyed, uh, as I have here, we're

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.050
like, Oh my God.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.300
Right.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.340
Just simple things.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:07.340
One of the things that, that, uh, we displayed the other day was, um, our

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:14.160
dashboard uses tiles just like every other windows app, um, or our, our app uses

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.280
tiles like crazy internally to the app.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:24.860
And when someone pins a tile, there's a default size, but each type of tile

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.420
has a different context.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:32.820
And what we have found is that there are clear, um, behaviors depending on

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:40.090
the tile context and the size that, um, certain tiles based on their context,

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:46.410
people are growing them or shrinking them, which, um, kind of means that perhaps

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.170
each tile context should have a different initial default.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.330
So, um, I want to touch on a couple of things you said and yeah.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.630
Uh, 20 minutes ago, you talked about matching intuition with facts or I

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.910
think it was intuition.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:04.790
And this is, this is the key thing for a lot of current testers to understand about

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:09.030
what moving to a data-driven culture, data-driven engineering means is that

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.020
forever testers I know are going, this isn't right.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.980
Getting suggestions on how this, we should have these tiles be smaller or

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.620
whatever.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.420
And the response has been go back to testing.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.140
We know what we're doing.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.620
The difference in a data-driven culture is look what the data says, look

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:31.140
at the insights I've derived and, and how I've derived them from how actual

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.740
customers are using the product.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.460
Again, testers forever, well, I am the customer, I'm the customer advocate.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.900
And as hard as you try, you're just not.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.780
But when you get, when you actually look at the customer data and get those real

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.740
insights, those are decisions you can act on confidently.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.060
The intuition ones are harder to act on confidently or darn near impossible

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.220
to act on confidently.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.380
Or even looking at a comment from someone on the forum said we should have tiles go

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:01.820
like this.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.900
And the answer may be, well, that's just one person.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.140
But when you start looking at this information and aggregate along, you know,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.260
thousands or tens of thousands or millions of uses, and then it's like, oh,

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.900
yeah, here's a decision we can make and it's going to make the product better for

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.500
the customer.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.900
And that is the shift for me from sort of the old world of testing to this

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.220
world of data-driven culture where, again, I'll call it testing, call it, you have

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.700
program managers looking at this.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.220
Someone needs to look at that data and make decisions.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.940
So that's really cool.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.340
It's very cool.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:45.580
The chart that I displayed for the PMs was Cindy Housen is a leading expert

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.900
on business intelligence.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.580
And she said, forget the website at the moment.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.540
But she did a study with 500 plus different companies.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:05.710
And the study showed project success based on what percent was sort of gut

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.270
field decisions versus data-driven decisions.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:16.150
And they basically, they found that teams that did around, I think the number was

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:23.840
60 percent fact-based decisions and 30 percent gut field decisions had the

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.520
greatest success and it was significantly greater.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.680
That's a really important thing to mention because I think a lot of people

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.800
will hear my last statement and say, well, Alan's saying that intuition

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.000
doesn't have value, but it does.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.400
It does.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:43.280
And you can, you end up, I think in a way, training your intuition based on

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.400
the fact and database decisions you make.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.400
And then also when you have, like, I think that if you have a hunch, I'll go, I'll

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.480
just stick with the same example.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.560
As a tester, we have, a tester intuition is very strong.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.040
I totally believe in it.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.040
Lots of stories about this that I won't go into.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.640
But if I have a hunch that we can do better with these default tile sizes,

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.880
for example, I'm going to, I want to try and go see if I can prove my hunch,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.470
my hypothesis with, with data.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.360
Let me ask you something, Alan.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.240
Let me answer you something, Brent.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.720
Where do ideas come from?

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.360
Ideas come from other ideas.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.000
Yes.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.240
Intuition is just another way of saying a new idea.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.500
You're a hundred percent right.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.370
Like these new facts are these prior ideas.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.930
So when I have a particular intuition and I get a new fact that comes in, I

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:46.130
will get a new idea based off of what I currently believe now modified by this new

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.930
fact. So the two going hand in hand is absolutely critical.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:56.610
In a deck I did recently, one of the things I explained, Hey, if you go

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:02.130
entirely intuition based, entirely gut feel based, Alan used the word

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.130
hypothesis testing, right?

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:08.210
It doesn't matter how much you actually believe you're right.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:15.300
But because no human being is able, is capable of keeping all of the

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.260
variables straight, this creates uncertainty because uncertainty, no

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.740
matter how right you are, you are, there is always some probability that

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.580
you're wrong.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.700
And when what ends up happening in these intuition only teams, right?

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.230
They end up being believers towards a path that's wrong.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:42.910
So intuition allows you a pure intuition model over and over again, allows

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:51.220
you to go very quickly towards solving problems no one has and spending a

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.860
lot of money doing so fact based.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.180
If you do fact based only, you can succeed on that.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:02.740
But the studies have shown that facts based really what it does allows

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.580
you to get to what's known as the local maxima.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:13.100
So if you if you think of a an up and down curve on a line chart, right, no

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.780
matter where you are, fact based decisions, what they basically do is

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.460
allow you to optimize for the maximum of where you are in that graph.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:28.180
But if there is a better maximum, fact based decisions may not get you

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.420
there. You need to have that game changing idea come into play that

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.660
says, hey, you know what, we may need to actually sub optimize for the

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.220
next couple of months because there's this greater opportunity that

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.060
that sub optimization will enable us to get to.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.390
Got it. Do you? I do.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.310
I think I do.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.990
One more rewind thing, which I think is worth calling out again,

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.870
especially for the Microsoft listeners and actually maybe for everyone.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.990
You are using a third party.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.310
Yes. Isn't that cool?

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.390
I've been at Microsoft.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:05.070
I've been doing this for 20 years and I've never needed none third party

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.990
to help me. Isn't that freaking cool?

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.870
I think it's so cool.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:15.110
We are such non-embracers of any technology,

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:20.070
such lovers of non-invented here to a fault to a fault.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:27.230
So I am just ecstatic when I see a team at Microsoft make a good

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.630
business decision about going, hey, this other company's product.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.550
Or this open source project, whatever it is, it's going to help us out.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.430
And we can we can use their product for cheaper.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:42.030
We have such and I could tell stories that would embarrass people

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.670
for making dumb decisions for the next two hours.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.270
But I won't because at the end of those two hours, I wouldn't have a job anymore.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.710
But we historically into one hour.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:55.630
Historically, episode 12, Alan's last episode.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.860
But it's great to see.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.820
I think it's really important.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:07.420
I love that our team, for example, is all in on using Git, which Microsoft didn't make.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.500
Oh, my gosh, we're using a source control system someone didn't make.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.380
And and actually, the reason we're using it is because it's fully integrated

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.140
into Visual Studio, not an ad, just the fact that the Visual Studio team

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.900
embraced it first and we just we just piled on.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.300
One of the things that also happened, so when we went with this third party,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.470
we're trying to light up what we internally call sort of self service

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:35.630
business intelligence, where we arm individuals

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:39.630
with the ability to sort of do the right thing on the instrumentation

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.790
and do the right thing on on by the way, totally awesome approach.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.830
I see teams approaching data analysis as sort of a ticket system.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.950
Like you have a question, give it to this team and they'll go figure it out

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.470
for you using their special archaic tools and command lines.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:54.590
They'll get back to you with your answer.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.710
Right.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.710
Six months later.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.670
Horribly non scalable dead end solutions.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:04.710
Well, it's it's a challenge to do the this and the self service model,

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.510
because typically I didn't say it was easy.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.350
I said it was the right way.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.830
No, no, it is.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.150
It really needs.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.670
And we've we've encountered this with automation.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.630
What's right? What the right way to to staff an automation team

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.790
purely decentralized or purely centralized?

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.670
And the answer to that is none of the above.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.910
The answer to any sufficiently complex question is it depends.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.870
In this case, it doesn't depend.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.750
I think that there is a right answer and it's someplace in between.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:38.190
It's basically you target decentralization,

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:42.550
but with the central governance authority to make sure people are converting.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.230
And we're off in the weeds here, but I hate I

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.200
you know, isolated or automation teams.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.320
This team does the testing.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.280
This team does the automation or this team writes the test cases.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.680
This team automates so far in the wrong direction that I don't want to start.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.040
And so I'm not going to go on, Brent.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.600
Yes. One of the new common problems that people are encountering

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.960
is with the data world is is is GIGO garbage in garbage out.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.960
One of the challenges me and my team has been facing

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.520
is this instrumentation problem like basically because we started

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.920
with a self service, be I approach, people are interpreting that as in essence.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.720
I can instrument whatever I want to, however I want.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.580
And one example is about a month ago,

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.580
we had five different ways to communicate

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.420
whether or not the call resulted in an error.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:41.290
PM's now going to this third party.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.140
Immediately, they they're confused

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.860
because the scheme is just all over the place

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.750
and within a week, an uphill battle

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.350
in terms of trying to get people to converge on a common

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.070
a common philosophy around schema.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.990
And in some cases, an actual common schema just died.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:11.330
Yeah, I'm a huge believer in garbage in garbage out as a way to make change happen.

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.970
Yeah. Like here's the answer we have based on what we have.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.810
You know, this sucks.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.410
Well, fix the input.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.410
One of the quick tangent here before we go on to the mailbag is

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.750
I had a maybe I told the story before, but

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.910
on a previous team was working with a guy and he

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.550
he wanted to get a bunch of data from the team.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.870
So he did what a lot of people at Microsoft do.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.590
He sent out a big spreadsheet and said to the whole team,

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.470
to 100 people, 150 people said, everybody fill your data in here.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.220
And he was mad because people weren't filling it out.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.100
He goes, I need to get a VP to go yell at him and tell him to fill his data out.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.940
That's not the way you do this.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.140
You can get Satya this in that email.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.540
It still won't happen.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.620
It still won't get done.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.620
So I told it is here.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.340
Let's let's just kind of napkin math.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.140
Let's fill it in. Let's go ahead and fill it in.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.060
So I don't know the answers.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.460
Do you have close guesses?

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.100
It says, yeah, I can probably guess pretty well.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.180
OK, let's fill out the whole thing.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.420
Let's send the new mail that says, hey, here's the data I have for the team.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.500
Please confirm it's correct.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.660
And we'll go on from there.

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.060
Man, he got feedback.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.020
It ended up with a really good set of data for him to work with.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.300
But that's that technique works wonderfully.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.460
You know, don't don't say, hey, fill in this section.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.460
You know, same thing.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.380
My boss did the same thing this week.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.460
He went last week.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.180
There was a slight reorg in our org and he wanted to send out a reorg mail.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:34.670
So instead of saying, hey, each test manager fill in this section, he said,

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.470
here, I wrote up the following.

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:38.310
Go ahead and corrected if you want to say something different.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.710
Man, did they change it right away?

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.230
You can't say this about our team.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.990
This will hurt so it's those feelings and whatever.

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:47.270
So it's I love that technique for getting people to do things.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:55.270
Yeah, but people definitely prefer to iterate off of a baseline than to get

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.670
together and create a new baseline.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:58.390
Yeah, crazy.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.110
That's what leaders do.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.150
They can do the creation.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:00.830
Yep.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:07.270
Hey, we skipped it last week, but now that I'm warmed up, let's do the mail.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.200
Nice.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:10.680
All right.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.960
That's been four months, three months, man.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.400
Yeah.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.960
I, I, and I forgot to work on that when I was out.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.920
So, um, Hey, a couple quick things.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.560
Um, one is I mentioned Microsoft listeners and, uh, Ching Song Yao has been

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.000
a good, he's been a faithful listener.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.920
He's posted on an internal Yammer and telling people listen to our podcast.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.240
So, so thanks.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.200
Thank you for listening and for promoting us.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.320
Uh, yeah, despite our silliness.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.200
So that's cool.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.280
And then, you know, we joke a lot about our three listeners, but guess what?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.120
Andrew, who, uh, I, I met in Australia when I was there, uh, two years ago

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.480
for the software testing Australia, New Zealand conference, and then, uh, there

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.480
was sort of an Agilish conference in Sydney.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.520
I spoke at, he said all the way in Australia, listen to our podcast.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.000
That's really cool.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.520
That's I I'm, I'm excited.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.280
So, um, so I have no idea how many downloads we have.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.320
But anyway, that's, that's pretty cool.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.840
Pretty cool.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.280
Hey, nobody's written a review for us on iTunes and iTunes.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.920
If you don't know what it is, is the really crappy product Apple uses

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.240
to work with their really cool phones.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.040
Is that a good description?

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.120
Yes.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:13.480
Okay.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.400
So you can write a review there, write comments, and we will, um,

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.680
address you in the mail bag.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.360
Someone tweeted me, uh, right when I got back from my extended vacation and said

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.640
something to the effect of, Hey, what would it be like if you took this sort

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.840
of vacation every year, like a two month vacation every year, what would

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:39.230
it like eight weeks of vacation look like when I first got back, I thought,

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.550
man, it would be so totally awesome.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.870
And the vacation itself would be totally awesome.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.510
My answer is every Corona commercial you have ever seen.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:53.510
But, um, one thing I didn't know, this is by far the longest

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.990
consecutive vacation I took.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.830
I took, I've taken two week vacations quite a bit.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.790
I took a three week vacation once, but I was gone for about nine weeks total.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.710
It's, uh, I'm just now a month back.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.350
Sort of feel like I'm, I know what I'm doing at work again.

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.870
The ramp up coming back after so much time off was hard.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.470
Why?

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.890
Um, well, for a bunch of different reasons.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:24.530
One, the first week I came back, I worked like shorter days because I had

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.410
not on purpose had some other stuff going on, but I was exhausted after five

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.530
or six hours in the office.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.610
I was just beat.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.490
I wasn't used to working.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.570
So I, there was a stamina issue.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:40.310
I had to work through it and then, uh, I came back to the same product team,

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.270
but a whole bunch of stuff had changed.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:49.300
I had to spend two, three plus weeks just figuring out what was going on and

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.500
who was doing what and what we were doing and what, and why we were doing

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.340
it and all that stuff.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.900
So it was almost like you, you.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.820
I'm not rehired into the team.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.860
I may as well have joined a new team because it was the same sort of

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:07.980
ramp up, except, um, uh, it was weird, maybe even a little harder.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.180
Cause I felt like this could have just been me trying to ramp up, but

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.540
almost its expectation like, well, of course, you know, what's going on.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.140
You're working on the team.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.700
I said, I don't know what's going on.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.740
I'm trying to learn.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.220
And I asked, is there a diagram that explains this?

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.300
No, everybody just knows it.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.820
And so that tribal knowledge, that, uh, all that's lost on me, that stuff

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.620
you get from context from being involved in the team on a regular basis

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.020
was just gone.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.460
So I ended up being the person to ask for, is there a dock on this?

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.580
Is there a picture of this?

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.500
Can someone draw me a picture of this?

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.340
Uh, just to try and figure out what's going on.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.820
So the ramp up time was, I think something I'd not want to go through every year.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.860
And again, our team went through a bunch of changes.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.940
It may not be the same, but, uh, getting used to working was a bigger

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.540
challenge than I thought it would be.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.820
It it's, it's interesting.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:58.500
One of the things that you just shared with me reminds me of one of the

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:05.020
consequences of, of the layoffs and you and I have a meeting, uh, I think

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:14.850
it's Wednesday talking about, um, the new sort of corporate wide, uh, approved

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:19.290
model for knowledge sharing amongst communities, right?

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:23.530
The, the communities that we've been, we've talked about several times on,

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.930
on this podcast are now officially unfunded.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:33.130
Um, I think it, and to be clear, I think that means I'm not sure about, uh,

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:36.850
communities you're involved with as our community will continue in a different

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.890
form with no corporate sponsorship.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.600
QTech?

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.750
Quick.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:43.900
Okay.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.460
Long story.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:44.780
Anyway.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.180
Yeah.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.660
And, um, what?

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.220
Yeah.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:52.260
You said, what, uh, internal communities we have for, uh, are based around quality.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.580
Well, there's three that, that I'm active in.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.220
And I know that you're in at least two of them.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.220
So I don't know which one you're.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.780
Yeah.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.860
Um, I don't know either.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.220
Yeah.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.740
I'm a thought that far ahead, but more stuff to ramp up on.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.340
So that it doesn't seem like a complete non sequitur.

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:14.260
Like it seems like, um, we still have a long ways to go to sort of, um, breed

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.340
out the, the tribal knowledge way of doing knowledge sharing.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.100
Yeah.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.860
We're, we're not good at knowledge sharing.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.740
I think, and I think you talked about learning earlier to loop back to that.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:29.200
I think from there you go to how, how do you acquire knowledge?

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.240
I have a big believer in Philip armor's five orders of ignorance and the fifth

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.020
orders for fourth order, you need a suitable means to discover what you

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.160
don't know, you don't know.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.600
That is a critical part of knowledge acquisition.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:49.000
And I think good communities are a great way or a primary way even to solve that.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.280
One of the, one of the approaches.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.080
So we now have a very active, um, Yammer group for my team.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.680
I'm going to go totally stock your Yammer group.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.920
Knock yourself out.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.200
Cause I, I, the only like totally active Yammer group I've seen is the one

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.360
that complaints about things.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.010
Oh, um, there's several that I'm on.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:14.000
It went and totally active is, um, relative.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:14.560
All right.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:20.960
The, um, but one of the words I keep finding myself saying over and over

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:26.460
again, once we've lit this up is posted on Yammer, please don't send me an email.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.470
And I'm very tempted to take up.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:35.780
Yammer's I now completely get why Yammer's doesn't respond to email.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.500
If you send anyone in the Ammer group and email, right?

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.220
They'll, they'll not do it.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.940
Most people view it as annoying, but now that I understand what it really

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.100
is where you, you capture knowledge.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.660
Well, we're not effective.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:55.140
Uh, I hate to pick on ourselves too much, but again, because the company's

00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:00.500
growing, we've done, I think, maybe I should characterize all of Microsoft.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:06.500
Let me give you a story about our team and we have not grasped the connection,

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.660
the correlation between communication type and communication and method.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:16.890
And to give you a hint, I went to a all hands meeting, got the whole team in a

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:21.800
room and when I have an all, if I was hosting an all hands meeting, it's

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.960
about interaction and discussion.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.240
You want to take a look, you're leveraging the fact, you have the

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.600
people in the room, let's let's, you know, whether it's roundtables or Q and

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.600
A or something, let's do something we can't do over another communication

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.760
mechanism, but it was all information sharing.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.280
They could have sent me an email with everything in there thought, wow.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.600
And yet then they send email trying to start a discussion.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.920
Said, no, it's backward.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.840
It's backward.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.880
Come on.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.810
And to me, it drives me crazy because just so obvious, but the way we've

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:59.290
grown up and, you know, again, I'm not sure how unique Microsoft is in this

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.690
aspect, but we are email centric.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:06.690
I think it's entirely, it's much like everything we've been talking about.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:07.170
Right.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:12.050
When I send an email, I want the answer.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.900
It's sort of local optimization.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:21.180
I'm not considering whether or not there exists someone else that

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.100
might want the answer as well.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:30.020
And how am I helping to coalesce this needed knowledge in a way to make it easier

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.660
for others, right?

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:37.340
And in the past, it's been challenging to do like I have no idea what I know that

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.060
Alan would like to know as well.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.080
Right.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:46.440
But if I start posting the, these things when, when they come up, everyone, every

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:54.080
once in a while, maybe I can get Alan to, to recognize, Hey, there's one out of 10

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.720
things that Brent puts on his Yammer group is actually interesting.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:06.160
It's worth my Alan's time to scan those emails for, or not emails, Yammer,

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.600
what it, Yammer posts for that knowledge.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.160
Yams.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:12.670
So I don't, I don't know.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:13.870
It doesn't matter.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:14.430
I don't approve.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.630
We should probably, we could probably have a much, much longer discussion on, on

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.190
knowledge acquisition and information sharing.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:25.390
It's when I'm bringing up in, in my internal group, when I bring up sort of

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.990
the importance of knowledge sharing, it's not inherently obvious.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.590
I have to go in and explain it a great deal.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.230
And I, I think much of what we've been talking about over and over again, that

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.390
this is really a systems problem.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:44.230
People aren't really, they're seeing the short term benefit at the cost of

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:48.510
the long-term benefit when there are, when there exists today's, today,

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:51.630
uh, ways to do both simultaneously.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.670
All right.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:56.430
I want to talk more about that, but not today because we're at a time.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.950
So if you listened this far, thank you and keep the questions

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.070
coming, keep the comments coming.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:01.670
Happy to hear from you.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:02.150
I'm Alan.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:02.790
I'm Brent.
