00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.570
Hello everybody!

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.570
Howdy!

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.570
I'm Alan.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.570
I'm Brent.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.570
Back for episode 39 of AB testing.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.570
Welcome back.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.570
I remember the number.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
Right?

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.570
Yeah, it helps.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.570
Because Brent wrote it on the board.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
Yeah, it helps.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.570
It does help.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.570
It does help.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.070
So, ask me where I've been, Brent.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.070
Where have you been, Alan?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.390
I just got back last night.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.470
I flew back from Waterloo and boy, my arm's tired.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.470
Ha ha!

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.290
Ba dum bum.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.290
I went to Waterloo.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.730
Do you know where Waterloo is?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.730
No.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.730
Canada.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.850
A?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.570
Is it Tim Hortons right next to it?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.530
Of course there is.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.170
Waterloo is about an hour drive west of Toronto.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.970
So I flew into Toronto, drove to Waterloo, parked my car where it stayed until I drove

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.330
back to the airport.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.850
But in between there, I had dinner with the board of KWSQA and then I gave a talk to

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
a sold out hundred-ish group of software quality professionals.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.850
Sold out!

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.570
You raking in the testing cash!

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.570
Yes.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.290
Yes, it's all on paper money.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.850
But it was a good time.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.050
Is that how you afforded all this fancy new equipment you got brought in today?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.570
So Brent just wants to change the subject and go.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.890
Happy 39th birthday to A.B.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.890
Testing.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.770
I bought us a new mixer.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.730
So whether you can actually hear us after this podcast is, we will find out.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.090
I don't know if that will work or not.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.450
Hey what's this button do, Alan?

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.210
Don't push any buttons because normally when I get a new piece of audio equipment I will

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.370
take time to learn it and make sure I understand what all the buttons do.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.380
And although I've had mixers similar to this in the past, let me make sure, yes I'm

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.460
actually recording on.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.620
I just thought that's a brief nightmare.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.860
Like I had set it up to record and then like left the program recording off of the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.580
laptop microphone, but I didn't.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.020
So we're actually recording off these microphones.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.540
So anyway, the subject was, I was talking about Waterloo where I had a great time.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.140
I knew there was a lot of tech there.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.780
I know Microsoft has recruited a lot from University of Waterloo there because they

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.400
have a great program where they do lots of internships, which is super valuable.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.980
And anyway, I didn't realize how much tech was there.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.580
They have like 200 startups there and all kinds of tech.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.740
There's this huge physics building next to the hotel where I stayed.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.740
Pretty cool town.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.900
I liked it.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.980
And I gave a talk that was similar to, I think I'm probably going to give an evolution of

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.100
these talks I imagine over the next few years and it'll go into our topic today, but sort

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.420
of what is the role of testers in this new world of software development, whether

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.980
it's agile testing, whether it's testing without developers.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.820
Sometimes I feel really good about what I'm doing.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.980
Sometimes as you know, I'm frustrated with, I feel like our team could be more agile than

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.380
it is.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.340
But then I look at it from the delivering frequent customer value at a sustainable pace

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.740
and we managed to do that despite the fact that we do things that I don't feel very

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.700
agile-ish about.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.380
So it depends a little bit how you look at it.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.900
But anyway, I'm sharing a bunch of stories about what I do, what's worked for me, what's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.180
done, what to worry about, what not to worry about.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.820
I asked a question at the beginning like how many of your testers, all the hands go

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.820
up.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.980
How many of you are here because you're afraid, you think I'm going to tell you how your job

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.300
is going to go away and all the hands go up.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.220
And by the end they're going, okay, I don't feel so bad.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.700
I kind of get where I fit in in this new world, which is I think a great gospel to

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.210
share.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.140
Yeah, you, was that, that's not the same presentation.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.420
Was it the same presentation you did for what was the QA?

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.860
No, I cannot give the same presentation in a row.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.540
So what I do is I wanted to give a variation of that talk.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.040
So I got, excuse me, I got rid of about half the slides, added another half to fill in,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.080
and let it evolve that way.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080
I believe in evolution.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080
I assume the, yeah.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.300
A lot of the same ideas come out, but I can't give the same talk, I've done it before,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.380
internally at Microsoft, when I used to teach things like at Neo and classes and things.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.520
But I don't like to give the same presentation twice because it gets stale for me fast.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.540
So I like to always change it and not just a little.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.300
I like to change it, you know, at least 25, if not 50% if I'm going to give something

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.040
sort of in the same topic.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.120
And as I learn more and as I do more things.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.680
There's some valuing consistency.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.800
I think to me it's just like the same principles that apply to software work.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.960
I want to evolve.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960
I want to iterate.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.560
I want to make, I want to throw out what didn't work and add what I think will work

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.000
before and listen and learn from that.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I agree.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.900
Of course you do because I'm right.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.690
There's an agile onboarding deck that I've been carrying around with me for the last

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.770
five years.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.690
And every presentation I go through, I am happy to say that it's now at a point where

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.170
I essentially do minor tweaks.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.640
The onboarding process is very similar to going through a class, right?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.240
You got to talk about the same things.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.090
You got to say the same reasons why essentially the only differences I do now with this deck

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.090
is I change the stories.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.690
And we're always getting new stories.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.690
Right.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.730
There's new, and not even the stories, even experiences.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.830
And I like sharing those.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.590
So a funny thing happened on the way to the forum.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.810
What?

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.570
With the forum being sort of me going to Waterloo and the reference to the musical.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.410
Are you catching on here?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.400
No.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400
No.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.720
Someday I'll introduce you to culture.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720
Good luck with that.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.140
Many have tried before.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.980
I'm still trying to work on getting into soccer.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.980
And thank you.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.980
That should be an easier one for you.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.980
We'll see you next time on People's Testing.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.980
God!

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.120
Oh my, my, my.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.190
So I was, hey, don't you have another conference coming up?

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.190
I do.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.190
I do.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.170
Oh, tell us about that.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.290
I'll be at Better Software in Las Vegas.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.290
Oh, sweet.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.890
Are you a gambler?

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:46.890
No I'm not at all.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.250
Because you don't know the games?

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.690
No, I know the games.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.680
I just like money.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.260
I don't like losing it.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.140
I don't like to pretend that I...

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.100
What you need to do is go, you go buy chips.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.100
You're buying chips.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.100
Yeah.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.620
And then I give them to the guy with the cards.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.460
And then it's not money anymore.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.940
You're losing chips.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.720
No, I'm really not interested.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.600
I often won't gamble at all.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.360
Sometimes I'll play, I'll be very careful to walk up to the lowest wage blackjack table

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.880
I can find and I'll play for like 20 minutes and walk away just a little poorer than I

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880
came.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.120
But I'm not really into gambling.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:40.680
I really like holding on to my money versus just giving it away to people for a very brief

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.680
amount of entertainment.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680
Yeah.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.320
I could have went and saw Deadpool again for that much money.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.560
Would have lasted longer.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.360
Hey, I finally seen Deadpool.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360
Deadpool.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.360
Really?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360
That was really funny.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.360
Okay.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.320
So anyway, yeah, I'm going to the Better Software Conference.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.440
That's like the first Monday in June.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:04.200
I'm giving a workshop on A-B testing or experimentation.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.720
I have some good information.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.000
I feel pretty good about that.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.520
About filling my time and having some good information.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.680
I'm not going to give away all the secrets today.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.080
Was the last time we did this a workshop format?

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.880
No, last year, about a year ago, I got a call.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.140
It was less than a year ago because I got mail that said pretty much something, hey,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.740
are you free next Thursday to give a presentation in Las Vegas?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.740
This was on like Friday.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.170
I said, okay.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:38.370
So I went down and gave someone that canceled and I went down and filled in and gave a presentation

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.970
on A-B testing.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.810
One thing about Seattle to Vegas, direct flights about 25 a day.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.050
Easy to get there and back.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:52.370
And apparently went well enough that Mr. Copeland called and said, hey, so next year, how about

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.370
a workshop?

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.370
Same topic.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.890
I said, sure.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.180
So here we are.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.180
All right.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.180
Shall we get to the topic of the day?

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.180
We should.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.180
So remember when I remember like a half hour ago when I was about to go into a new subject

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.980
and you distracted me?

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.280
While I was there, I was checking out the Twitterverse.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.680
While I was in Waterloo, I was checking out the Twitterverse as I don't often do these

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.560
days but do when I'm traveling to see what's going on.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:29.380
And there was a tweet and I'm going to get into, I was going to dance around for the

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.220
beginning, I'll dance around context, but we'll have to get into it.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.260
There was a tweet from another small workshop conference.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.700
Wait, wait.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.700
First and foremost.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.790
Without explaining it, do you know the context?

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:49.790
Yes, there was a conference on, a peer conference on reinventing testing by James Bach.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.790
Okay.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.030
I'm going to go ahead and use names up at, and I'll get into the rest later, up at, I

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.590
think it was placed in Orchis Island and there was one slide that was controversial.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:05.630
So while it could have been, well, it could have been just contained within the workshop,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:11.790
Matt Hoiser for reasons, I think, to stir up controversy or to just share it with the

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.010
world or to share his thoughts, took a picture of it and tweeted it.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:26.680
And I looked at it and I thought, what the front door is very interesting.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:35.670
So it was, I don't want to go into a lot of, I want to try and just look at the facts

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.790
here and my experiences and how they relate to the bullet points versus I think there's

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:46.590
a lot of psychology that I could go into why James put these bullet points on the slide.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.070
Because I think James is really smart and I like him.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:56.710
And the only thing I'm going to say is it's slide comes across as very defensive and

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.550
without context in many cases.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.350
So again, not a slime on James.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.670
And thanks, Matt, for posting it.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.760
I'm sure, I'm not sure how James feels about that now that the controversy is rolling,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.480
but I do want to talk about the bullet points on the slide.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.240
So if you haven't seen it, you can go find it.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.640
Look for the, and what was really weird is the make testing great again tag.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.240
It's a little too Trump like and made things a little awkward for me.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.540
But actually, can we start with it?

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.540
Sure.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.540
Sure.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.540
Make testing.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.320
Great again.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.820
When you read that literally make testing great again, right?

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:50.160
I don't think there's anyone, well, at least in my mind, there's no one that's going to

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.960
disagree with that when you look at it literally.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:06.010
Now I suspect that the intent behind that hashtag is make testers great again.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:12.480
I don't want to, I think it's unfair of us for to dissect the words and go into intent.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.680
No what I want to do is there's, so for me, this is relatively context free.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680
All right.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680
Okay.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680
I'll let you continue.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:30.660
And what I want to really what I want to address is look at this sort of visually

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.400
on its face.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:43.000
What is from our point of view, the most likely interpretation of the intent here as well

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.840
as what is what would be the most respectful interpretation.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.840
Okay.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.900
So spit it out.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.740
That's so for me, making testing great again.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:06.430
I know most or the three will know that we are supportive of unified engineering.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.070
We are supportive of agile practices.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:19.360
We are not necessarily, I know I'm, I don't want to speak for you here, but I am definitely

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:32.160
not supportive of a large dedicated testing, tester individuals that all they do.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:41.150
But the hashtag says test Dean and I am definitely supportive of testing improvements.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.310
But I believe that those efforts need to be moved up the stack.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.950
I need, I believe dev needs to be trained on these things.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.850
And that's how we achieve making testing great again.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.420
One of the things, uh, that was a lot of words to not say very much.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.820
I said a whole bunch of, okay.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.820
All right.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:06.620
So one of the things I tweeted in some tweets term about this was that I'm working with

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.740
some of the best testers I've worked with in my 20 years, 25 years of testing.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.620
They're just not called that.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.620
Right.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.360
Yeah, it's true.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:27.090
The yeah, the, the, the other thing when I, when I first look at this, right, I like that

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.640
line.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:36.480
Um, it reminds me of our presentation at redfin where, uh, one of the questions that got asked

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:44.840
us is, is in my view, this sort of old school archaic, uh, question of, well, isn't it true

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.760
that if devs test their own code, they can't maintain objectivity.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.380
Right.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.460
And I'm no, it's not true.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.700
That is actually, that's a myth.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.420
And uh, and some people would say that the op that, that the opposite is a myth.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.420
There's a big, that's a controversy.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.750
It's a disagreement.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.180
Software testing is not a field without controversy.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.310
Yeah.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:14.030
So for, for 22 years now, I guess I've been dealing with, um, even when I was in test,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.030
right?

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.710
And dealing with the questions around is a great tester, uh, born or made.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:21.710
Whatever.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.710
Right.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.550
So I want to get past the make testing great tag.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.550
Go ahead.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.550
Actually talk about the slide.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.550
Go ahead.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:32.310
So I'm going to, uh, let's have a discussion on the title and the bullet points.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.870
Hopefully not too philosophical or long, but just kind of see what they mean to you, how

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.870
they resonate with you.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.350
So the title of the slide, it says, this is the premise, the theme in the agile world.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:47.960
There's an ongoing and longstanding attack on the testing role.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.330
So you want to start?

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.330
Yes.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.330
Go ahead.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.330
And no.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.050
So I look at that and I go, no, there's not.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.050
But in a way there is a little bit.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:06.920
There was one of the, uh, one of the books on agile had a chapter on manual testing and

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.480
the chapter said, and I'm paraphrasing or could have been called, it was manual testing

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.560
and it was just one page.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.270
It said, don't do it.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:21.160
And it was tongue in cheek and, and it, one thing and I'm paraphrasing some little correct

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.280
me and it's fine, but you get the idea.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:32.410
Uh, the ads, any book on agile or any, actually this podcast, anything I say, anything you read

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:38.890
in a book, anything you hear anyone say, it is not a blueprint to tell you how to do everything.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.250
Context always matters.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.890
Whether you're in the context driven community or not, you have to be driven by context.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:49.980
So, so when I read books on testing, I found plenty of stupid things.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.980
Didn't mean testing was stupid.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.740
It means there were some stupid things in there.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.100
Same things happens in all the literature on agile.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:05.860
Uh, so there have been jabs at not testing, not the testing activity, but little jabs

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:12.040
that the tester role, maybe do we need a team dedicated to doing testing?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.600
So I can see a little bit where that's coming from.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:23.720
But for me, no, I think in my experience in agile, um, testing has been, ah, for the most

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:29.070
part embraced, sometimes briefly forgotten, but then quickly remembered.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:37.070
To me, when I look at that, I, I think of other industries that have gone through transition,

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.070
right?

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:46.730
Um, in the auto manufacturing world, there has been a ongoing and longstanding attack on horse

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.290
trainers, right?

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:57.690
If you think back to the 1800s and when the automobile was introduced in, um, similar in

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:03.530
in Detroit, when, when assembly lines, uh, started getting robots added to it.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.530
No, not automation.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.210
Automation will take our jobs away.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.210
Right.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.210
Exactly.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.290
Uh, and actually that, no, that's a very good point because that's, that leads us

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.370
straight to manual versus automated testing.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.370
Right.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.690
Testing is not a world without controversy.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.560
Now it's the world.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:28.680
Any time there is a change in which the world, uh, is, is moving toward this is a better

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.680
practice.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.740
Go ahead.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.740
One of the points I made in, uh, it reminds me that I'll continue to make, I made it

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.660
up at Waterloo is I, before I said a minute ago, testing is not without controversy,

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:45.020
whether it's manual versus automated, exploratory versus scripted testers versus no testers titles.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.140
Uh, you can do a couple of things with that.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:55.660
You can either deny it and tell the world that this change is stupid and it's, and it's confrontational,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.100
or you can figure out what it means for you.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.020
How does that change me?

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:06.540
And anytime I look at a sufficiently complex problem, I will look at one technique I love

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.740
is look at extremes.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.420
What would it look like if we automated everything?

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:15.340
What would be the bay, the gains, the benefits, as well as the drawbacks and losses.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.460
And also what if we automated nothing?

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.620
What if we did everything without automation?

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.940
What would happen there?

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.700
And the answer is somewhere in between, depending on the product and the context and how often

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.820
you're shipping, those things are going to happen.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.260
That the, where that slider is between those two is going to be in a different spot.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.260
Yep.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.140
And it's the same thing here in the world with, you know, are we, what would it be

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:42.890
if we had no testers versus a massive one to one or even larger test to dev ratio?

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.650
Look at the pros and cons figure out where that line is.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.370
There are lots of inefficiencies there.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:51.040
So that's going back to my topic from Waterloo and away from the topic on the page here.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.200
But I think this first bullet point I'm going to go ahead and read because I think it's

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.520
in the, you finished because it will, it will relate to the title.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520
Yeah.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.800
It says agile was not created by testers or with testers.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.480
It's a programmer's utopian vision.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.870
So what's your takeaway on that?

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.710
I agree with the first sentence.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.000
I don't necessarily agree with the second.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.690
Agile was, was around before the manifesto was around, right?

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:34.470
It was a large number of people seeing similar practices working through similar things.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:39.840
And they said, Hey, let's get together and, and knowledge here.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:54.700
Now the, the, this entire slide is, is sort of filled with controversial terms meant to

00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:05.200
inspire emotion towards the point that the, the author is making the, the, just because

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.840
agile was created by or not created with testers.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:19.800
We are to believe that that is sufficient to prove that it was a programmer's utopian

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.570
vision.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:22.570
Right.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.570
And, and right.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:30.680
And you use the word utopia to sort of imply that this is a dreamlike state that's never

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.560
achievable.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.560
And when I look at this slide, we talked about this on the podcast.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:44.120
And if I had realized that we now had the ability to bring in the third mic, I would

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:52.970
have invited Jeffrey Weston to join us today so that we could, as we go through this slide,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:59.060
also have a brief lesson on fallacies.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:10.150
The, the, the thing that actually puzzles me about this slide is Bach is well known in

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:15.070
the testing world as a grandiose systems thinker.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.070
Right.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:23.760
But this slide, this slide without any context now, and I want to say one thing, one thing

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.390
very clearly, I don't suspect this happened, but if the slide that came after this just

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:35.750
said the word not, well, then, then I'm like, okay, I get the point you're trying to make.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.710
That is a worthwhile comment to make.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.310
I don't know if you ever read the Lessons in Software Testing book.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.310
I have.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.630
Well, one of the things they didn't ask me to quote anything from it is they would have,

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.910
they would say, blah is good on one page, next page, blah is bad.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.950
Just showing context.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.390
So that very well could have happened.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.260
So we don't know that we don't.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.260
We're out of context.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.420
All right.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.180
I don't think it's utopian.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.220
I think it was, you know, add the manifesto came about.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.460
There were some developers who were doing some lightweight development techniques who wanted

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.500
to figure out, can we, they're just trying to get rid of inefficiencies.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.060
To me, anything that gets rid of inefficiencies, I'm a big fan of theory of constraints.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.620
I think Agile and theory of constraints work well together.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.380
It's about identifying what's the bottleneck.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.380
Let's mitigate it enough.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.380
We're not a bottleneck.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.380
Let's move forward.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.900
And Agile is about eliminating some of the bottlenecks and finding some of the things

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.980
that work well and finding ways to make them better.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.300
It is not a playbook.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.430
It is not a, you know, I think one of the things that, you know, you're talking about

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:39.750
utopian being a word that that makes it that as drama here, the fact that they call the

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.110
the principles of the principles of the called the Agile manifesto.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.110
The principles are different.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.710
But the manifesto sort of mentally conjures some of those same images.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.100
It's easy to push back on something that's called the manifesto.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.820
Well, and I've talked about it on the podcast before.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:04.900
I'm not going to go deep, but as you well know, I am not a supporter of the manifesto.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:11.300
It encourages people to just go look at one page and go, oh, I get Agile.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.940
And Agile is far more complex than the waterfall model.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.780
It's a lot of moving parts.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.700
It's primarily a principle driven.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.060
Yes, absolutely.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:29.860
I don't even know if calling it a principle driven framework is even correct because how

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.220
do you have a framework with principles?

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:40.840
But as you call out correctly, it's about consistently identifying and eliminating waste.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:54.050
The other thing on this first bullet point, right, the why is it a problem?

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.890
That's the thing that I ask myself upon reading this bullet point.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.340
So what?

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.300
The one thing, and we talked about Ryneartson's book.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:11.440
If you go into look at Ryneartson's book and you want to understand the details about why

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:17.500
they made that decision, this is trying to lead us to believe that a bunch of programmers

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.140
got in a room and they said, how do we screw over test?

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.180
No, that is not what they did.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:30.020
They said, how do we build better software faster to compete?

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:37.380
They were looking at what is the better practices that get rid of waste that adds value.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.280
So it isn't, in my view, like if we want to talk about testing, it isn't about making

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.720
testing great again.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.360
If we want to have individual tester roles, then what we need to do is make those roles

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.640
valuable again.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.640
Sure.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.520
Okay, I'm done with that, Ryn.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.520
Go to the next one.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.920
They frequently said that Agile discourages specialists.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.820
A specialist tester, a specialist seems to be defined as anyone who does not specialize

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.900
in programming.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.620
Agile definitely discourages specialists.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:15.270
So when I think of specialists, I guess when I see specialists, I think of the generalizing

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.030
specialist or the specializing generalist, which is different than the specialist.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.030
You're correct.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:25.330
So I guess in that sense is correct, but I believe that.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.290
For the next sentence, I think I know where you're going, and I think I agree with you.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.290
So shoot it out.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:34.050
A specialist seems to be defined as anyone who does not specialize in programming.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.290
And that is not true.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:41.510
An Agile team is made up of these T-shaped personas, to use the term most often used

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:47.850
in Agile, and fit together to make sure that the sum of everyone can do all the parts.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:53.380
A team full of specialists is very difficult to do that.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:58.740
Someone who is solely a testing specialist, you have to provide a lot of value.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.420
And generally someone who's smart enough to be a really good testing specialist also has

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.380
the breadth they can fit in well with an Agile team.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:14.360
The other thing I'm going to call out, the thing I find wrong with this, is I don't

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:21.560
think a traditional testing role is a specialist.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.190
I think they're a generalist.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:32.070
Now it's still correct in that, as we have said on the podcast repeatedly, we don't like

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.590
either of these.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:39.780
We don't like pure generalists, and we don't like pure specialists.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:47.420
And as sort of hand-wavy proof of my point of view, I'll point to your deck.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:53.020
Any place where you have a role where the individual is responsible for doing the remainder

00:27:53.020 --> 00:28:00.250
of the stuff that no one else wants to do, that in my view is the definition of a generalist.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.970
And that's traditionally what test is done.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:07.770
Program management has defined what the project is, programmers write the code, and then the

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.170
remainder is done by the test team.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.290
And that can be a lot of different things.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.290
There's definitely specialization when we talk about automation.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.290
Sure.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.290
Right.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.290
Dev.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:19.290
And there's over-specialization.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:25.620
Some people, I knew a lot of testers at Microsoft who wrote functional tests eight or nine hours

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.700
a day, every day for their whole career.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.700
Is that testing?

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.540
Ish, but it's a very, it's very de-specialization.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.220
Those people are either not here anymore or actually many of them turn into pretty good

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.660
programmers, developers.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.260
One of the earliest works on Agile, the XP white book, claimed that no one likes to

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.460
do testing.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.570
This set the tone ever since.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:54.340
So I'm going to go back to the comment I made earlier about the, again, every sentence starts

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.900
with a truth and then ends with a huh.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:28:59.900
So two sentences.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.180
First sentence, yes, the XP white book said that, I can't dispute it.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:10.220
But just because it's written down doesn't mean you have to follow it.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.140
And then I disbelieve that it has set the tone ever since.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.700
There have been plenty of things that have happened all over in the Agile and outside

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.700
of the Agile world that have set the tone for testing not being exciting.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.940
That is not the fault of Agile.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.420
We've talked about this on a, uh, I'm going to make you drink every time you say we've

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.420
talked about this.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.770
I'm bringing in tequila shots for number 40.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.590
Okay.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.580
You have, okay.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.170
What's that point again?

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:50.570
One of the earliest works on Agile, the XP white book claimed that no one likes to do

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.780
testing this set the tone ever since.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.780
We've talked about it.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.980
I've blogged about it.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.590
The history of test.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:06.180
One of the, if we want to talk about the history lesson, then let's talk about how

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.680
tests got developed.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.360
It's actually in your, uh, in some degree it's in your presentation.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.880
There's one aspect I think you're missing.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880
Probably not.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.920
Maybe you usually write how did test get, how did the testing role get created at least

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.400
as it relates to Microsoft, right?

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.080
It's Hey, we can hire this cheap guy to do the crap we don't want to do.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.080
Yeah.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.080
Right.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:38.030
So pretty much it, it, um, this XP book did not invent this concept.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:45.230
This concept has been around ever since the, the dev test codependency loop began to get

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.230
constructed.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.230
Correct.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:55.760
Um, now does, uh, so in, in one regard, you could say the agile community, if it is a community

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.760
of programmers said, you know what?

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.640
Yes, we created this role.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.800
We made a mistake.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.520
We going to take it back.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.480
Okay.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.320
Uh, that's one way of looking at it.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.320
Okay.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.320
The next one, um, I'm just going to read and move on because I wasn't there.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.320
So I can't comment.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.160
Uh, 2004 agile fusion conference collapsed in acrimony when Brian and Merrick claimed that

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:25.810
testing is only reluctantly about finding bugs and Bock and chem can or vigorously objected.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.620
So I don't know if it collapsed again.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.620
I wasn't there.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.900
I don't know.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.980
Testing is only reluctantly about finding bugs.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.860
And I'm not sure I entirely disagree with that, but I'm not going to debate that.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.340
I've often said that finding bugs is sort of the side effect of doing the testing

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.340
job.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.250
I'm not sure if that's the same thing or not.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.530
And then this event, this is like, then we kicked him out.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:54.210
This event marked the exit of Brian Merrick from the context driven testing community.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:59.270
Um, so it's, I think that was, uh, I'm not sure how to read that one.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.470
I just kind of want to move on.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.710
Do you want to add anything on that?

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.830
Yeah.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:09.470
Uh, Brian's making a face complete non, you know, thanks for that information, but it's

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:10.990
a complete non sequitur.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.990
Yeah.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.990
So moving on.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.990
Yeah.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:19.310
So the most popular book on agile testing by Crispin, actually it's by Crispin and Gregory,

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:23.150
is not cited or thought of as a testing book among testing specialists.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:27.860
It barely discusses testing.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.460
Go ahead.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.100
So you're friends with Lisa.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:36.740
So I like to consider myself, um, one of my specialties to be testing.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.740
I wrote a book on it.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.740
Um, it's obsolete.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.100
I've mentioned before, but, uh, I wrote a book about it.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.860
I consider myself a specialist in testing and, um, I, I liked the books.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.740
I especially liked the second one.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.940
The second one has a lot more testing goodness in it.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.380
The second edition.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.660
Yeah.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.580
No, it's called more agile testing.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.860
Okay.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.820
Um, a lot of guest writers and there it's a, they're really good books.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.740
I consider them.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.500
I, I recommend them often.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.820
People will talk teens about having a no-chester role.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.620
I said, go read this book.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.300
See how it figures out.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.180
It's there's lots of great information there.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:12.730
I don't know why it depends on context because James may not consider me to

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.410
be a testing specialist among his peers that are testing specialists.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.170
Maybe they don't know about the book or like it, but I think if I consider my

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.170
peers who are testing specialists, most of them do know about it and do appreciate it.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.910
The, I don't mind.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.670
I have to drink.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:41.210
So I think this comes back to sort of, um, one of the discussions on CDT and

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.570
their, their point of view of how the world turns and, and it kind of, for

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:53.210
something that is context driven, uh, their view is some is incredibly static

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.950
around is this testing or is this not right?

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:05.690
The, and then the thing is, so I have read Lisa's book.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.960
Unfortunately, I don't recall much from it.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:16.620
Um, I read it years ago when I was going through my own self-training

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:23.780
on Agile and I wanted to get a better sense of how Agile worked in multiple

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:31.670
discipline, uh, scrum teams and Lisa's book, uh, does give great insights.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:36.500
Her point, as I recall, and please correct me, cause I'm sure you

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.860
remember this better than I do.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.980
Even though the book is titled Agile testing and, uh, I'll go ahead and

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:52.030
agree with that it barely discusses testing and I'll say that's not the

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.350
point of her book.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.510
That's a good point.

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:57.510
There's plenty of books on testing.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:05.630
The value add that Lisa brought into this is essentially, Hey, this Agile

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:09.950
thing is a better way to go.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:18.630
And she's actually attempting to actually make testing great again, or to reduce

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:25.310
the losses given Agile is an unstoppable force at this point in time.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.030
Right.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:32.580
The, the world is not going to go back to these long delivery cycles.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.500
The world is not going to go back to, to the, like the, the, if you want to

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:44.590
talk about who's making the greatest attack on testing, it's data science and

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.770
telemetry, right?

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.490
We, we now can measure the ROI of things.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:53.850
We now can very rapidly get actual customer feedback.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.930
We don't need artificial advocates in the front of it.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.490
So yes, in many ways, yes.

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:05.370
And I want to actually play devil's advocate for James and his community

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.130
because again, I have nothing against James.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.850
I think it's important to talk about these in the context of AB testing, these

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.890
bullet points on this slide and kind of what our testing world is.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.930
But if you think of our testing world, the reason we're opposed to these

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.050
bullet points, because we live in a different testing world than James

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.010
Bock and his peers.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:27.570
I think a lot of his projects, I have to assume, again, I'm not in, I, I, I

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.810
don't get to look over his shoulder.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:33.770
Um, but I think he does work in a lot of, we get software at the end.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.610
If you think of you're working with companies where it's an IT company,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.370
you're getting software at the, you know, here's the software, make sure it works.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.490
Doing that rapid software testing.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.730
Like you have two days, let us know whether it's okay to go to customers.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.450
Um, the things he teaches in his world is really good at finding

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.370
those key issues at that point.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.930
We just don't live in a world where we're going to do that.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:57.450
We live in a world of high daily quality versus let's, let's try and

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.850
make sure quality is really good at the end.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.650
Here's, here's something we have talked about recently.

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:07.640
One of the things that, um, now I'm super conscientious about having

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.760
talked about that recently.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.320
Thanks for that.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.000
You're welcome.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.040
Yeah.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.200
I was trying to help my peers improve.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:23.610
Um, you and I have been talking about these sorts of topics for at least six

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:30.890
years, and we have seen Microsoft go through a massive transformation.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:36.010
Uh, one that I'm very pleased with and we're not completely done.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:41.530
Um, and I know that you're happy with this trans, uh, transformation as well.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:51.960
But we also know, we also know that most of our, the, the people who are one of

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:59.120
the three, but they, we know that for the most part, they don't live in that

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:05.320
world, but one of the things that, that I have observed is when I talk to these

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:13.820
guys or I tweet them or we, we chat on the slack channel, um, they're now what a

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.380
place where we were three years ago.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:22.840
Where there's this sense that it is coming.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.240
It is real and it's hit their company.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.940
So there's this, um, right.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:36.790
Uh, we've had multiple conversations, uh, with other, other folks.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.110
Uh, I remember one time you, you pulled together an agile panel.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:45.550
You asked me to speak on it, uh, for tests and, uh, when tests was still here

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:52.900
at Microsoft and there was a lot of anxiety around, this is a threat to my job.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.660
Hidden behind, this is a threat to quality, but when you, when you just

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.940
scratched the surface and didn't take much to, to get there, it's really,

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.620
this is the threat to my wellbeing.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:04.460
Yeah.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.620
And I remember as early as it's funny, I remember this and recalled this at,

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:14.540
uh, in Waterloo, but as early as maybe 2005 or so, I was asked to come talk to

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.720
a team, uh, I did a lot of that at that time, uh, where they said, Hey,

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.920
we are, our team's doing agile and we're not sure what our test team should do.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:29.010
It wasn't, I hadn't done, I knew about agile then did I didn't, Lisa's book

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.450
wasn't out and really having any ideas, but in talking to them, the, the

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.170
answer emerged quickly.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.650
It's like one of the best things you can do is it helped define what done is

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.450
and make sure that, make sure that done happens.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.210
So when we think of that testing role or that quality role within an agile team,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.690
it's, uh, there's a lot of coaching and training of developers on what

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.770
testing needs to be done.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.610
And, and thinking about, well, what actually gets, cause when I get that

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.370
highly daily quality, make sure things, things are done now versus having a

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.390
coding milestone or stabilization milestone.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.490
It's like, what needs to happen to be done?

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.770
And those things are really important.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.850
Like a great value for testers to bring to the table of the slides, like this,

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.170
uh, of all these bullets, right?

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:16.410
Uh, under the, the hypothesis of the context is, Hey, everybody hate agile.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.050
Cause it's coming to steal your jobs.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:23.970
This bullet is the one I find the single most offensive one because

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:27.650
Lisa is not attacking testing.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:32.570
What Lisa is doing is recognizing testing is a set of outcomes

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.370
and a set of activities.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.290
The world is shifting.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.930
We have a bunch of people who are trained and understand how to help make

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.370
better software in this product.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:50.010
And she is teaching testers how to thrive in this new world.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.090
Yeah, I agree.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.650
I agree completely.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:57.010
She is the defender of making testing great again, way

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.690
more than she is the attacker.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:40:59.050
All right.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.970
And to be clear, it's, it's they cause because Janet wrote the book too.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.810
Right.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.770
So I'm just, just to give credit, this slide calls out.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:11.330
Let's do the last bullet point, which is again, um, a slight non sequitur,

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.690
but, uh, just goes into the whole theme of the slide.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:21.650
TDD and BDD are focused on excuses to be done rather than a sincere inquiry

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.010
into the status of the product.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.570
Yet both are regularly confused with testing.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:33.390
I'm not confused, but I don't know anyone who actually has those anything other

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:38.750
than the definition of TDD and BDD, who thinks they're, um, a substitute

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.950
for a larger set of testing.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.910
Um, TDD is a design technique for writing unit tests that make sure

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.150
you write simple testable code.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.790
Yeah.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:53.110
BDD, I love even more behavior driven development because it makes you think

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.430
about what the outcomes are of the software, the behaviors of the

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.190
software before you implement the code.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:41:59.710
Yes.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:05.910
Um, and I've said before drink, uh, maybe not on here, but to me, the

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:09.910
biggest benefit of BDD, there's all kinds of, I'm a fan of gherkin and

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:15.510
BDD frameworks, but the benefit to me, the, the majority or the vast

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:19.750
majority of the benefit of behavior driven development comes from just

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.950
thinking, what are the behaviors that need to happen?

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:26.030
Cause it makes you, it's helps you scope your code again, write more

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.350
testable and sensible code.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.390
If you want to automate that test, that's great.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.910
That's fine.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:35.390
That gives you a nice integration test, but really thinking about the

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.870
behaviors before you implement the code and then writing the code to

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:39.910
make those behaviors work.

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.630
That is the win.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:46.150
The thing, and this is prevailing in this one, like this last bullet

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.070
point just hits it hard.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.870
Okay.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.940
Both TDD and BDD are regularly confused with testing.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.660
That's the final point of this bullet point.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:06.440
And I have to say first and foremost, that's wrong.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.360
They are not regularly confused with testing.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:22.130
What they are is regularly confused with a better way to reduce risk to the product.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:28.930
The thing I find that troublesome with this last sentence is he's holding true

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:34.730
that test testing is inherently valuable.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:42.240
He's holding true that a sincere inquiry into the status of the product

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:49.500
is inherently valuable, which isn't to say that I'm disagreeing with it.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.580
I'm saying it is not black and white.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:44:00.960
The, we know from, uh, uh, many of these conversations and

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:06.040
CDD sort of community, there's a point of view that testing's role is to

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.400
provide information to the business leaders.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:08.880
Okay.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.840
If testing's role is to provide information to the business leaders, TDD

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:21.320
and BDD is about prioritizing and identifying upfront what information is

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.960
valuable and incorporating that into the strategy of writing code such

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.880
that, you know, upfront and continuously.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:36.240
On development teams that practice TDD and BDD, uh, what you get out of them

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.440
in my experience is code that works pretty well and beyond just the

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.760
functional level at the integration level.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.160
And then instead of having the world where you give me code and I go, okay,

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.240
here are the bugs, blah, blah, blah, I'm not even half thinking about it.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.880
You give me a product to test.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.840
It's like, okay.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.880
Now I take my serious, inquiring exploratory system thinking, testing

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.600
mind, and I have to work hard to find out where the detractors, the customer

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.160
value are and that, that is where we need that skilled specialist tester.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:11.890
But without using some doubt, putting effort and care into making and

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:16.090
programming the software correctly, the testing job, it actually does become

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:20.410
something that the moron out of junior high school can do because

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:21.970
it's easy to find bugs.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:23.570
There's a quote.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:27.330
I, and I'm, it's, it's a quote from this guy named Alan page.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:32.090
So, but I forget and I'm going to misquote it, but I remember an event you

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:40.660
did, or maybe it was a tweet is that bugs should not, should be hard to find.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.020
I say that all the time.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:42.460
Right.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:49.410
And even in the world where there's a mixed role, where you have tests and

00:45:49.410 --> 00:46:00.520
dev as distinct specializations within a team, TDD and BDD should be highlighted

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.040
for this, I can't tell you how many years I've been dealing with these

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.920
the testers in a room going, how do we move quality up the stream?

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:15.520
How do we help, uh, dev not create all of these bugs that keep throwing

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.680
crap across the thing?

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.880
I'm like, you can't have it both ways.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.480
You can't simultaneously say, we want to move quality upstream.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.000
We shouldn't be finding these low hanging fruit, stupid bugs.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.800
And then also bash the key and extremely valuable techniques that does exactly

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.000
the things that we've been complaining about as a community for decades.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:39.240
Yeah.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.200
And if you also, if you say that developers are not capable or they're not

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.440
objective enough, test their own code BS, because those types of things,

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.360
those easy to find those low hanging fruit bugs, things they should be finding.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.800
And they can use techniques like TDD and BDD to make sure those idiotic bugs,

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.400
those brain dev bugs, those stupid bugs that a junior high schooler, that my

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.600
kid in junior middle school sixth grade could find actually my daughter

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.400
in fifth grade could find are found before they get to the specialist

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.080
testers who can then go, ho, you know, when's the last time you had a product?

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.480
You had to look at and go, it's hard for me to find bugs.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.200
That's the kind of stuff we need our skilled testers to do.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:20.160
We don't need, if you want to think of testers as this lower skilled, you

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.320
know, this, what was the bullet above about setting the tone for no one

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.720
likes to do testing, no one likes to do boring, repetitive testing.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.440
If you give me a testing activity that is hard and I have to mentally strain

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.320
myself and I feel exhausted at the end, but happy with my work, that's

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.560
the kind of testing I want to do.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.960
That's kind of testing, testing specialists should do.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.560
That's, that's reinventing or make testing great again.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.840
It's not about this other BS.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.910
It's not about setting up boundaries and looking for conflicts between

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.310
communities or processes.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.830
It's about making the job challenging and rewarding.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:03.270
Now, I think of this and I think of the other James Whitaker six years ago,

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.230
huge controversy test is dead.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:07.380
Right.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.860
And I look at this and I'm like, was it even six years ago?

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:11.580
It was longer than that.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:11.860
Wasn't it?

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.180
No longer.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.540
10 years ago.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:19.180
And, and I look at this and he's going, uh, test is dead.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:20.560
Right.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.760
In, in, in, how do we go after agile?

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.220
Like dude, you don't like this stuff.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.460
Again, it goes back to what does it mean for me?

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.340
How does it impact me?

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:32.340
It's not an attack.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.700
And, uh, I know, but the reason why I spawned this up and I should have

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.340
actually tied the, or connected to before I gone into it, right.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:47.330
You, if you want to have this world where you have, um, you said Dev and

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:51.850
tests and Dev can't test their code because they're, they're too subjective.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:52.690
Right.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:49:01.180
The thing is, as we've said over and over again, that world is increasingly

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.860
shrinking and it is not the dominant part of the world today.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:12.460
You can't, the single most precious asset in software today is calendar time.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:19.090
You can't afford that world where you assume Dev is moronic.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.860
And that is the business reality.

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:28.950
And it is ever increasingly becoming true in a world near you.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.510
All right.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:31.470
One last thing to say.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:32.910
I'm done.

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:33.710
Good.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.710
Thank you for listening.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:35.550
Thanks.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:36.270
I'm Alan.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:36.830
I'm brain.

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:37.710
We'll see you next time.

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:38.150
Bye bye.
