00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.460
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980
Now, on with the show.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.940
Hey, hey, Brent.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.980
Hey, Alan.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.100
It's time for another episode of A.B. Testing.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.140
Do you know what number we are?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.140
I do.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.140
I looked it up this time.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.260
Are we 130?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.420
We are.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.300
I mean, I have only one real job on the podcast.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.140
And last time you just went forward without me.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.620
I know.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.780
And I think I got it wrong.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.980
Was that last time or the time before I got it wrong?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.380
It was last time.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.460
What did I call it last time?

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.820
128?

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.580
Yeah, you were.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.140
And it was 129?

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.940
Or are we just permanently off by one now?

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.900
No, no.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.500
We're good?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.820
We're good?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.900
You correctly corrected it in editing.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.500
Wow.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.980
Nice.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.380
Yeah.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.780
So on my little recording device, it's just called 130.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.700
So I guessed well.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.620
That was my guess.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.580
I was going to double check with you.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.980
So here we are recording on Friday.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.460
This will come out on Monday, November 2,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.650
which is one day before the US election.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.490
And I have never in my life been so nervous over an election.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.490
Over an election that 538 says currently Joe Biden,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.210
well, anyone who's not Trump, has a 90% chance

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.650
of winning the election.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.940
But I am still nervous because it comes down

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.020
to what three or four or five states decide to do,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.380
which seems really fair.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.700
That's what people wanted when they made up

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.980
electoral college for sure.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.820
There's crap going on to stop people from voting.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.300
There's crap going on to try and throw candidates under the bus

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.620
four years ago.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.420
I wasn't the biggest Hillary fan either,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.380
but I think Trump's a piece of crap.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.380
But I was confident that he was going to go away and do

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.060
his talk show.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.420
And then crap happened.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.140
And I have not been happy.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.180
And not because I don't like him.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.680
It's not because I don't like him.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.180
It's because of the things he's done that make me not like him.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.020
Short story is, welcome to the AB testing political podcast.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.420
I'm Alan and do my NPR voice.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.140
And now over to Brian.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.140
So you were mentioning, you were hinting

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.940
as we were talking, you have a prediction.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.200
And you being the data scientist,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.560
I hope it's not based on data.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.880
And I hope it doesn't just, I have a knot in my chest

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.080
talking about this.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.720
But what do you, what are you nervous about?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.440
What are you thinking about?

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.520
So I will, I will share with you what my thought process is.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.560
And then I will assure the three.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.800
This is entirely based on non data sources.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.160
It's, it's, it's more based on you remember back in the day,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.520
when you and I were laughed at repeatedly because we saw

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.440
that within the next three years,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.560
the whole of Microsoft was going to get rid of tests.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.000
I do recall this.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.960
Yes.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.560
Well, I wasn't the data scientist then,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.200
but, but my prediction kind of comes from that same space.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.400
So you and I tend to pay attention to what's going on

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.880
in the world around us and not in an echo chamber

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.320
or even the bubble we live in.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.280
So yeah.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.840
First off, I'm pretty sure I've mentioned that on the,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.480
the podcast, right?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.390
I don't think Alan's ever mentioned it,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.590
but he's, he, what party he's affiliated with,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.190
but he definitely has Democrat leanies.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.670
Well, I had never thought about it much

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.150
until the last four years.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.470
My viewpoint is I think people should be allowed

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.230
to do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt other people.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.830
And I think people should be treated fairly.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.230
If that affiliates me with a party, then it go ahead.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.670
I believe in the golden rule.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.550
One party is closer to that, at least than the other.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.390
It's interesting.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.270
You say it that way.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.830
Cause your first statement, I completely agree.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.270
I haven't thought about your second statement enough

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.150
to decide how I feel.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.310
The problem with deciding that whether or not people

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.790
are treated fair is fair as a subjective term,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.790
but I do believe that people should be allowed

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.190
to live their lives as they see fit.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.470
I'll just say I am a libertarian,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.710
which means no matter who I talk to,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.070
no matter who I talk to,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.130
I can agree with them that the other guy is an idiot.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.870
And in this case, like we keep hearing that,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.710
that this is about to go into a two party system blows rant.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.510
Oh, a two party system does blow.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.990
Everyone knows that it's idiotic.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.670
We keep hearing- I want rank choice voting

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.470
and no electoral college and term limits.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.070
Oh, term limits for everyone.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.350
I'm so with you.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.130
Those are my, I'm gonna run for something.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.910
Class president of the AB testing podcast.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.470
And those are the three things I want.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.650
I want rank choice voting

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.030
so we can get other parties involved.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.550
Even if it takes a while to get them to grow,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.030
I want to get rid of electoral college

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.750
because it doesn't make sense anymore.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.190
I'm sorry.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.010
Your arguments are invalid and I want term limits

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.760
because just turn on the news and you'll see why.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.400
Let me, I'll just quickly glance through

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.640
sort of my philosophy and then give you my prediction.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.320
Meanwhile, the listeners are like,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.240
fast forward 30 seconds, still politics.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.320
Fast forward 30 seconds, still politics.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.400
All right, go on.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.280
Up next on the AB testing podcast,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.060
religions and which one's right.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.730
I don't know if I can do anymore, man.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.050
So, right now with the two party system,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.050
I actually view the Democrats and the Republicans

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.250
as the opposite sides of one very stupid coin.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.610
And the way I view that they differ is the Democrats

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.370
offer freedom and independence on social issues

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.210
but want control of fiscal issues.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.570
The Republicans are the exact opposite.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.650
Like the best thing the Republicans as an example

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.570
could do for their party is boot the religious right out.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.570
And I think that would attract a large number of centrists

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.570
but I am not in a role for political advisement.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.690
A libertarian kind of goes, no,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.530
we want the freedom and independence

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.970
on both sides of that coin.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.810
And for those who aren't aware,

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.970
the opposite side of a libertarian

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.250
is a socialist where as I was saying,

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.290
no, no, we want the government to sort of be a big part

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.850
and regulate both sides.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.810
Now, that said, so at least on one of those pivots,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.940
you and I agree, my prediction for this election,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.100
I will state that it's a three-parter.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.200
Sadly, I believe Trump will win.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.600
I hope to God you're wrong.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.560
I very strongly believe he will win.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.640
I can even articulate why I think that.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.000
I don't want you to because I don't believe you.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.440
Okay, good.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.400
The second thing I believe is he will be impotent.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.400
I think the Democrats will control enough of Congress

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.760
that essentially the next four years will be a no-up.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.280
The checks and balances haven't worked the last four years.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.050
It's been a wreck.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.010
It's been an absolute wreck.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.490
Yes, completely agree.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.130
The third thing, and this is the thing

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.210
that I am worried about, you asked what I'm worried about.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.490
It's the third thing.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.760
If I am right on the first one,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.480
it doesn't matter if I'm right on the second one.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.320
If I am right on the first one,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.600
I do think the third thing will happen.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.790
And that is literally America will burn.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.890
Yep, I believe you are correct.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.890
And there are signs of what I will call

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.650
political blackmail already occurring.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.370
A buddy of mine, and now I haven't confirmed this,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.010
but a buddy of mine was mentioning

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.730
that in his neighborhood, he had heard, right?

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.930
So this is now a three level indirection.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.930
He had heard of pamphlets being distributed to houses

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.770
in suburbs saying if Trump wins,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.850
this house will be damaged or destroyed

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.530
or something like that.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.730
Right, Am.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.410
So it's conspiracy land.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.690
Yeah, I don't want to, look.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.290
The thing I'm saying on this front,

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.650
the fact that rumors like that are even coming

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.980
is what worries me.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.860
I don't care what the thing is.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.700
All right, I'm gonna close this out

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.740
because the listeners are super, super bored.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.580
You know, I could only hope that,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.980
I don't believe you on point two.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.980
If Trump wins, I think he's gonna continue to incite hate.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.100
I do not affiliate myself with a political party

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.180
so I think the two party system is broken.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.180
It doesn't help that you're being a libertarian,

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.500
just those are your political views,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.940
doesn't give you a candidate to vote for

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.020
because you can only vote for one of the two.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.260
I got a candidate to vote for.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.340
Yeah, it's a wasted vote.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.700
Yeah, and it's already been,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.580
my wasted vote has already been sent.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.020
If a fraction of the voters that voted

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.620
for the third party candidate in the swing states

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.020
where Trump barely won voted for Hillary instead,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.710
we'd have a different crappy president right now.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.750
Yes, that's absolutely true.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.050
The data will tell you that.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.690
So anyway, again, I don't like either party.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.060
That's a concern this time too though, right?

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.060
Right, because there are actually a lot of left leaning folks

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.740
who are essentially.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.380
Hopefully aren't so stupid

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.700
to know that their vote is wasted.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.540
And again, because of our lovely electoral college,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.780
your vote only counts if you live in one of 10 states.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.300
Otherwise, nobody gives a crap

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.020
who your presidential vote is for

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.060
other than bragging rights for the popular vote,

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.020
which I guarantee, unfortunately again,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.060
I guarantee Biden will win the popular vote.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.580
I think it's a 0% chance.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.020
Anyway, let's go on with the podcast.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.220
There's your political commentary.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.420
This is gonna come out Monday.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.580
You can pontificate on this.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.540
I took today off to build some furniture

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.540
and to putter around the house

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.180
because I, as I mentioned last time,

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.420
I wasn't earning any more vacation days.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.280
I am taking Wednesday off as an election recovery day.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.760
I plan to stay up late watching and either crying

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.920
or being relieved.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.960
I don't know if I'll celebrate,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.580
but I will be up late, gonna take Wednesday off,

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.780
try and recover, get my mindset for what,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.820
based on whatever happens

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.900
and plow into the rest of the year.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.580
So let's get into the podcast proper.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.500
How many minutes have we gone by here?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.420
Okay, about after editing,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.300
maybe 12 minutes into the podcast.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.460
We had a great conversation, a meeting this week.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.780
So my manager, our VP of engineering,

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.260
has a weekly meeting with all the people managers

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.920
in his org once a week for 30 minutes,

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.920
which is actually really good.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.520
It's a way to have the right conversations,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.960
align on some things.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.730
Sometimes it's business, sometimes it's just a,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.810
what do you think?

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.490
And I had forgotten.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.130
This is a question that maybe early on

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.490
in our relationship,

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.610
I remember sitting at that Vietnamese place

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.930
having a conversation about this topic

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.330
and you had changed your mind since then.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.050
And I hadn't really talked about it much.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.770
I have strong opinions about this.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.050
Well, strong opinions about the ambiguity of this question,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.370
but it generated a lot, a lot of discussion.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.290
So I wanna throw it at you

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.170
and maybe for our listeners for comment.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.160
And here's the question.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.040
As a manager, how many people should you manage?

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.160
What's the limit?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.790
What's the minimum?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.950
Minimum?

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.310
Minimum, if you're gonna be a manager,

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.470
how many people can you effectively manage?

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.070
I don't think there, well, okay.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.470
So minimum's actually easier than maximum.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.030
No, minimum's one, right?

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.870
Minimum's one.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.100
But if I were in an executive role, right?

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.780
Would I ever do that?

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.980
And of course the answer is no.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.140
I can put constraints around it.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.860
So I remember these days, like back in the day,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.260
it was four or five and at Microsoft,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.980
there was a phase where needed to be a minimum of 20.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.620
This was when Microsoft was heavily laden on managers.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.940
And now it is, I would say the policy

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.780
is a bit more laissez-faire.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:21.070
It's, we don't see, you don't see too many small teams

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.110
and small teams, if they get constructed,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.350
generally you'll see in the next budgetary cycle,

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.630
you know, a couple more heads.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.870
Notice how Brent still hasn't answered the question.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.620
Minimum, five.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.580
Maximum?

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.700
There it's gonna depend on the person.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.860
What is the answer to any sufficiently complex question?

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.780
42.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.140
The answer is it depends.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.740
The answer to any sufficiently complex question is it depends.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.580
Yeah, on that one, but still I wanna come up with a number

00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:01.640
and I'm gonna say somewhere around 20-ish is the maximum.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.800
Yeah, and it depends on seniority,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.020
what you're working on, et cetera.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.860
I'm flat, flat, flat, flat, flat.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.220
And I fully believe, yeah, you can manage,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.500
I don't know if I go as high as 20.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.460
I currently have 11 direct reports.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.820
I feel pretty good about that.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.020
People say, oh, it's so many.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.220
And I think, no, I think I'm under control.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.480
But there was a lot of pushback on the team

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.040
from having a high number of direct reports,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.600
like more than eight.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.450
So Brent, how do you manage a team of 20?

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.410
A standup with 20 people is untenable.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.420
A standup with 20 people is untenable.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.680
It's not the same topic.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.080
Yeah, yes.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.360
That was an area of pushback that made me go

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.520
from leaning back in my chair, going along with to,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.920
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920
Wait, wait, wait.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.040
Let's talk about.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.960
Look, I was just thinking through,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.880
I had my data science head on

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.960
and one of the things I was thinking through

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.440
is essentially like an old econ supply and demand curve.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.040
What would we look at to identify the ideal number?

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.360
And then it very quickly comes down to principles.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.320
Now, in this entire discussion,

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.880
you've been asking me,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.120
mid and max from managing a team.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.790
I don't give a crap about managers.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.110
What I want is leaders.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.990
And the problem when you have a manager

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.310
is with a small team,

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.430
they have a tendency to micromanage,

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.590
overly focused on the product,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.270
fail to encourage autonomy

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.910
and fail to come up with vision

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.500
or principles or rallying cry.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.180
On the other side though,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.020
I was just thinking,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.820
what's the biggest issue you have with too large of a team?

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.830
And that's, you have to choose what you spend,

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:11.910
like for me,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.270
I currently have a half hour one-on-one

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.070
with each of my directs.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.830
At some point in time,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.350
with 40 hours in a week,

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:26.430
that means I could have a max of 80 reports

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.150
and all I would be doing is one-on-ones.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.990
Right?

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.550
Which doesn't scale at all.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.190
There's other meetings you need to go to.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.030
And by the way,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.150
I also do weekly one-on-ones for a half hour

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.590
with all of my directs.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.590
Any other leads in the org,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:45.150
so if I have leads reporting to my managers,

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.270
I'll meet with them every other week.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:52.270
And then I have another half dozen or so people

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.790
I meet with monthly,

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.350
maybe 10 people to meet with monthly.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.950
So I spend a lot of time on one-on-ones,

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.050
I find it very valuable.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.290
There's something else I was gonna mention, but go on.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.370
Yeah, for me, one of the things that I did,

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.890
particularly as at a defense for COVID,

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.650
is I kept my one-on-ones,

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.370
but when it came down to specific project questions,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.490
I found that my team kept on trying to set up

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.330
additional half hour meetings in a one-on-one context.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.050
Right, you had mentioned that before.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.210
Yeah, and so I actually just created

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.690
a daily one hour Brent's office hours

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.210
and say, that's where you come in

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.450
with your one-off three minute question or whatever.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.010
And that's been effective, it's been effective.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:42.900
I've gotten everyone to a degree of,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.740
I'm able to spend time coaching them through the career,

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.140
coaching them through their development.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:56.270
The team feels like they have a dedicated time

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.790
to come in and-

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.830
I'm gonna put us back on topic here.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.230
Oh, I thought I was on topic.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.550
Ish, I mean, it's great.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.030
You have one-on-ones, they're effective, awesome.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.670
The other bit of, so one was standups,

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.430
and of course, the team size doesn't mean standup,

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.070
we've got multiple projects.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.070
One bit of feedback I gave though,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.030
when you go the opposite, which is,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.590
we, you and I have seen at Microsoft in these

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.070
where every single different feature area had its own lead,

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.910
even if they had one person or 10 people.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.950
And you end up shipping your org structure.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.310
The other thing I want your feedback on

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.160
is a lot of people push back on saying,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.400
well, if I'm a line level lead,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.680
now you just have ICEs reporting to me,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.960
I can't manage more than six people

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.270
and still provide any tech leadership to my team.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.710
I'm too far away from the tech

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.630
once I manage more than six people.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.110
What do you say to that?

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.350
I would say that's a person

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.630
you should double the size of their team.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.590
Because they're, and I'm serious,

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.710
because they're actually focused on managing and not leading.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.070
I agree a million percent.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.190
And it's a wacky solution, but I tell you it works.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.190
It's like, no, what are you gonna do

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.150
to put this manager in a position

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.510
where he gives up micromanagement as a solution?

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.600
No, stop, guide, direct, measure.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.280
It's only been in this position,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.520
this is really the first time where I have not been able to,

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.800
managing managers of a team of about 60 people now,

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.500
where I can no longer contribute anything technically,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.300
whether it's code, whether it's technical documentation.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.080
I no longer have time for that.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.040
However, even when I managed fairly large teams,

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.280
moderate teams of 20, 25,

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.280
I could still do non-critical, important tech work

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.120
if I wanted to stay sharp.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.480
And I found that very easy to do.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.480
I knew what people worked on,

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.600
I understood how it worked.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.660
I just don't get the argument that,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.120
because I'm, and again, I like the fact

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.200
that they are putting an emphasis on growing people.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.320
And that does take time.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.800
Recruiting for open positions takes time.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.280
It's hard to fill a team,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.880
but I just do not buy the statement

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.220
that once you manage more than six people,

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.120
even if they're all super junior,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.160
because they'll take time,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.280
they will take more time when they're junior,

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.480
but I just don't believe that stops you

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.120
from being able to contribute technically.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.900
Again, lots of variants.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:44.600
The answer is, my answer is eight, plus or minus five.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.140
Eight plus or minus five is the-

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.980
I don't know.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.400
I just made up a number.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.460
Yeah, that would be eight minus five.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.020
So that means, no, that's a bullshit number.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.400
Yeah, of course it is.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.020
Eight plus or minus two, maybe?

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.900
Like the Scrum one, that's an easy answer, right?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.180
There's a lot of actual science.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.060
There's actual science on this one,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.660
where the ideal Scrum team is five to seven.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.260
So if you have 20 directs, all right.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.020
And they're probably not all working

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.080
on the exact same thing.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.320
I actually prefer that, I don't even like seven.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.120
So I'm going through a challenge related,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.480
not a challenge, a shift in my org,

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.960
where a lot of folks have been,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.280
org I inherited, I should say.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.960
People worked a lot on their own.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.680
Here's a project, one person worked on it.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.360
Here's another project, one person worked on it.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.960
A lot of stuff being worked on at once.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960
Not a lot of things, as you can imagine,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.670
being finished.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.550
What we're working on now is doing more of these projects

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.750
that are shared and worked on,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.280
not only by multiple people, but wait for it,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.680
self-organizing teams that span managers.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.300
Now, how do you do a standup?

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.620
You do it with the damn people

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.460
who are working on the project.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:14.460
Therein lies the solution, self-organizing teams.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.820
I'm lucky I can do that,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.620
given the nature of infrastructure and DevOps,

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.580
whatever you want to call it, work.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.540
We're going to focus on finishing,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.620
and even better, even better, one little plug for me,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.620
and I have another topic to do, we can go more in here,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.940
but in my self-organizing teams,

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.860
I love this that the people working on the teams

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.500
span different managers.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.580
It's going to work great, I'm pretty excited about it.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.820
But also, I'm giving all of the projects codenames

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.520
to end after Hanna Barbera cartoons.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.240
That's pretty cool.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.920
So last week I kicked off Project Grape Ape.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.600
I was just going to ask, I was just going to ask.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.680
I can't tell you what it is,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.200
something came up that I had to set up.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.920
I knew I wanted to do something about it.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.520
I knew I wanted to get a bunch of people involved,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.760
and I knew it was something that if it had,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.000
there were key words I did not want to mention

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.120
in the channel title.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.360
So on the spur of the moment, I made up Project Grape Ape.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.160
Somebody asked me, are you talking about

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.270
the children's cartoon or the strain of marijuana?

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.110
And I said the children's cartoon.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.950
What?

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.790
But very cool.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.450
And so I'm kicking one off again.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.490
I took the day off, I didn't send mail today,

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.840
but on Monday, I will be kicking off Project Yogi Bear.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.280
Nice, is Boo Boo going to be your last one?

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.840
Do you know how many Hanna,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.590
I mean, I have the whole Scooby Gang to go through.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.670
I'm loading it up.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:45.510
All right.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.670
It is now the single most important thing.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.990
Of course, because you're so ADD.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.710
Snagglepuss.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.070
Yeah, Project Snagglepuss.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.990
Huckleberry Hound.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.390
Oh, I always loved Captain Caveman.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:03.550
Okay.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.420
Anyway, that's how I handle team size.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.980
It just let teams, well, don't let them,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.180
help them organize.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.660
And I know I've mentioned it before,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.060
and I mentioned it to my team now,

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.900
the World of Warcraft guide to project management.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.980
Get a team together.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.820
It's like the end game in World of Warcraft.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.380
Get a team together with varying skills.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.980
Work together to solve a common problem

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.580
when you've reached your exit criteria.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.460
Because even in a raid in World of Warcraft,

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.700
maybe you don't want to do the whole thing.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.100
You just want to get to the one chest

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.420
because you want to help this one guy

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.980
get this one piece of armor or whatever.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.180
Whatever the goal is, you accomplish it together,

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.180
and then you either take on other tasks together

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.840
or you disband.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.200
It's one of the things,

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.320
there's a planning event from SAFE

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.880
that is very much aligned with what you're talking about,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.800
as we've talked about here before.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.660
Again, I don't like SAFE, so, half.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.630
All right.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.430
Shockingly, does not hurt my feelings.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.090
But the planning event kind of solves that problem,

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.090
where basically a business leader comes in and says,

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.400
these are the scenarios we need accomplished.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.640
The other aspect that really helps here

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.360
is when you do self-organizing teams

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.960
is that you have missions and not owners.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.900
Right?

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.580
I kind of think of it like a military mission.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.620
Hey, we need to go take out that artillery bunker.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.460
Right?

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.890
Once it's done, it's done.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:41.890
But when you have product teams with feature owners,

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:47.690
there's this general inclination to locally optimize.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:49.980
Right?

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.240
Oh, yeah, Alan.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:58.240
Look, we just nailed feature food for the United States.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.000
And then Alan goes back, great.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.880
What's it gonna take to go globally?

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.490
Oh, well, it's gonna cost the same amount for each country.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.930
Yeah, but the rest of the countries

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.050
are only 10% of our usage.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.380
Yeah, well, do you want globally or not?

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.220
Right?

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:21.380
It's one of those things where if you were in a more

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.460
dynamic scrum type organization,

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.500
you might be offered the opportunity to say, no,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.540
actually it's not worth the price tag.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.490
But when you have feature teams, they just,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.930
okay, well, we'll do the next country and the next country.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.570
And I mean, it's a bad metaphor,

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.730
but I see that feature teams are product teams

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.970
when they go down that model,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.170
they have a tendency to sort of local optimize

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.170
instead of global optimize.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.450
Short story is self-organizing teams,

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.570
let them figure it out,

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.810
give them the help and coaching they need

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:58.410
and Hanna-Barbera project names.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.650
I wasn't planning on getting there

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.850
from the conversation about how many people should you

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.050
manage, but it reminded me of something.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.810
And I think it depends.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.490
I think I don't like managers

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.610
only one or two or three direct reports.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.330
I think it's, I prefer flatter orgs.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.170
It depends on the seniority of the manager,

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.490
lots of other things,

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:23.290
but I think it's perfectly capable of managing

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.850
well into the teens.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.250
And as you said, 20, I think it's definitely possible.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.450
It just depends on a lot of different things.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.050
There's only one scenario where I like

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.880
a manager above a small team.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.500
And that is they are a new manager.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.340
That's it.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.180
That's the only-

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.020
Sure, and I wouldn't put it,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.470
I wouldn't give a new manager more than five.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.670
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.550
Okay, so I have another topic.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.390
Nice.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.830
I don't know if you saw,

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.110
a while back in Twitter,

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.310
where should I start on this?

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.510
Of course we have, plug,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.110
the Introduction to Modern Testing course

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.990
on Ministry of Test.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.670
Still getting people going through it.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.320
I think it's really done well.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.800
I've also been thinking about what's next.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.200
If that's the 101 for modern testing,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.480
what's the 201?

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.320
Put some questions out on Twitter.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.120
Didn't get a lot of good answers

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.080
until I think it was Lisa Crispin's answer.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.640
And I forget what she said,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.960
and I should have brought that up.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.320
Let me see if I can find it in my replies.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.840
No, I can't find it.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.400
But it was something to the effect of,

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.520
what does it take to,

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.480
the principles are great,

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.080
what does it take to be a modern tester?

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.430
Or how do you do these things?

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.510
That got me thinking,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.030
and sorry, Lisa, for messing that up,

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.230
but it got me thinking,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.710
because other things were around the basics

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.470
of how do you get developers to test.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.470
And I actually just did a talk on that,

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.470
an eight minute talk for Test Flix I recorded.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.790
I don't know, I can't remember when the event is.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.110
I'm sorry, maybe I'll put a link to it if I remember.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.110
But there was that bit,

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.390
then it kind of hit me.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.370
Because what I'd like to do is a workshop

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.290
for Ministry of Test,

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:19.450
just to promote the course

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.090
and to get some more ideas about that.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.640
But the working title is,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.730
so you want to be a modern tester?

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.570
We can start off with, well, of course,

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.410
DevOps is a culture,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.890
modern testing is a culture.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.530
We have DevOps people to help facilitate that culture.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.410
Hence, we could have modern testers

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.600
help facilitate that culture.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.440
So in that, is like,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440
one of the things,

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.760
if you're want to move the org in that direction,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.600
what are the things that are difficult

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.570
in those first steps?

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.730
One is getting developers to test.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.890
I feel like I have a good model for that

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.650
in pairing with them, asking them questions,

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.530
working on coaching,

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.810
which is getting people out of telling them what to do

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.610
versus asking them to think about what needs to get done,

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.170
get them to actually shift into that testers mindset.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.400
I think that's one area.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.670
Do you struggle with getting them

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:21.790
to take over accountability for testing?

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.710
No.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.030
Because of the way you've described it in the past,

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.870
you kind of trick them into it.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.790
It's not, we do trick them into it

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.870
by pairing with them or working with them.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.700
And then it's as I've described,

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.860
a developer may ask a tester,

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.700
can you test this for me?

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.860
And instead of saying, sure, yes,

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.500
let me please test that for you.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.140
You can ask, well, sure,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.100
what have you tested so far?

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.020
Well, nothing.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.180
Okay, let's do it together.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.020
See, it'll be fine.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.860
Maybe the next time it's,

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.660
well, I've tested A and B

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.140
and they pair together to test on C and D

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.340
and eventually gets to the point

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.780
where the developers actually done all the testing

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.880
and they say it looks pretty good.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.400
Very shortened versions of how that works.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.760
So what happens there is that's a way

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.960
to work with developers to get them to be accountable

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.760
and feel like they get them over the bridge

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.880
where they feel like they can own testing.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.880
But then the next thing that happens

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.740
is they don't realize what testing they're missing.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.440
I think continued pairing to get them to think about

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.800
after you ask them what testing is remaining

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.640
and they can say, I can't think of any.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.120
And you can say, great, what still worries you?

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.570
What do you think is still risky?

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.050
And then you can probe for questions on perf

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:44.370
or reliability or latency and form hypotheses

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.650
that you can go form tests to prove or disprove.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.370
I think there's a topic there.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.410
I don't believe it's a whole 90 minute topic

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.440
for like for a workshop, but maybe it is.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.560
Maybe it is, what do you think?

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.450
Is there, because the other option

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.730
is we could go deep diving in teaching developers to test.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.290
It's not that different from teaching testers to test.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.210
I feel like if we talk about the coaching,

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.890
that would cover that.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.450
I think about the two ways

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.170
that I've been able to help teams transform.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.930
Honestly, well, it's been the same way.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:27.130
And I wrote it up in a very, very, very old blog post.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.730
And that is essentially shaking the tree.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:35.290
It's essentially by leveraging unified engineering

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:41.680
and at the same time sort of removing the QA role from this.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.800
It's setting the expectation that from here on out,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.480
every member of this team is a developer and a tester.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.480
Now, I know for a lot of our community, right?

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.080
That's basically saying, oh,

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.800
but you're saying that if I want to be a monetization,

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.240
I have to learn the code.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.120
I think we can nip that one in the bud,

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.960
but I like where you're going because we could address,

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.440
this is all principle seven, right?

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.770
This is maybe there's an exercise on,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:14.850
and this may be in the core.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.210
This is actually in the course already on,

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.170
what would it take for your team not to have dedicated QA?

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.450
What would have to happen?

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:23.090
This is my thinking of it.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.210
In a world where let's say we had two disciplines

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.090
on the same product.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:31.770
Let's say we had dev and P, not dev and PM, dev and test.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:37.630
Well, towards that product in the prior vernacular,

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:41.070
we would refer to them as specialists.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:46.070
And as we've mentioned a bajillion times before,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:51.190
specialists are bottlenecks and modern testing

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.430
is anti-bottleneck.

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:55.710
Well, the easiest way to,

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.870
how do you take two sets of specialists

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:03.150
and turn them into generalizing specialists?

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.790
Well, you force them into an environment

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:11.670
where they have to essentially cross breed.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.390
Now what makes them a specialist here is their knowledge.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.790
So we're not actually asking them to cross breed,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.830
but their knowledge to cross breed.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.660
And you have to put them in a situation where those,

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.660
the only way for them to claim success

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.220
after say a period of six months,

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.380
is that that knowledge was successfully transferred

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.980
both ways.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.140
I'll give you a very tight example.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.780
Number one, one of the ways I see these type

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.260
of unified engineering orgs poorly implemented

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:49.260
is by putting the prior dev manager in charge.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.660
Because one of the issues is management.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.700
You have two managers often where you only need one now.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.760
Well, no, what I would do is instead

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.920
is keep the same number of managers,

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.080
but swap, basically do team membership trades.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.820
As an example, let's say you were a dev manager

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.460
and I was a test manager, okay?

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.260
What you and I are going to do,

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.180
we both manage 10 people, okay?

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:28.880
What you and I are going to do is you're gonna give me

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.420
your three best developers

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:37.070
and I'm gonna give you my three best testers.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.270
Those three best developers,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.190
they're going to be accountable for driving

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.990
whatever relevant knowledge to me, the manager,

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.380
as well as to the rest of my team.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.700
But the tester side, right, when it comes down to votes,

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.860
because I have seven testers and three developers,

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.540
that test side is going to balance out those three folks.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.100
So to be clear, this is your plan for we have a QA team,

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.260
we have a test, we have a dev team,

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.620
and we're going to just have a dev team,

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.060
one way to make that work, I agree.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:13.900
Yeah.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.500
So really, you wanna mix and match the talent

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.300
in a way that enables people to learn.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.620
But we should also talk about, I mean,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.700
again, this was your example comes from Microsoft,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.140
where we experienced at Microsoft,

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.860
where at the time you did that,

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.580
we largely had test teams who were roughly even equal

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.220
in size to the dev teams they worked with.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.540
I think what we'll find that a lot of companies today,

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.060
is that's not the case.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.740
The number of QA folks is a much smaller percentage

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.420
of the overall staff.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.700
Typically embedded in teams as an agile team,

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.940
they still do all the testing, gross.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.940
The flavor of that though still works.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.500
I think to answer the question,

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.020
I'm all you're telling me I have to code, no.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.650
The folks that have formally been in QA for me,

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.810
some of them are coding,

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.570
some of them are quality coaching,

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.730
some of them are in DevOps where they do code,

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:10.850
but they're doing different,

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.250
it's a lot of infrastructure set up as well.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.250
Some are doing program management or project management.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.520
Anyway, there's a lot of different directions you can go.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.000
Aside from the dev stuff,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.080
let's talk about the other thing that I think is hard

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.880
for people who look at the principles.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.600
And that's right up your alley, it's data.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.960
Yes.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.440
So there is something there.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.350
So imagine you're somebody, QA person

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:44.700
or quality minded dev person on a team.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.340
And you look at the principles and go,

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.900
yep, we care about the business, yep,

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.660
DevZone quality.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.620
You go on down list, you go data.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.380
Now we don't do data.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.940
Or we can't do data because it's,

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.140
we're worried about collecting the wrong information.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.460
I could tell you from experience,

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.980
a lot of people are afraid of collecting any usage data

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.540
because they think it's PII.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.980
It's not.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.980
Oh my God.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.340
Does that drive you crazy too?

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.140
No, knowing which button they clicked,

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.300
that's okay, that's not PII.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.100
Okay, there's nothing personal about it.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.940
It's fine.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.820
I actually, for a longest time,

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.500
that one would drive me nuts.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.860
I still hear that too often.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.840
And this is what I tell them.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.600
Let's play a little game, Alan.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.600
Alan, do you actually know what PII means?

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.320
It means personally identifiable information.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.160
Right.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.760
And almost every person I talked to

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.040
knows the answers to that, but they have forgotten it.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.280
They don't understand the meaning.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.760
They just use PII, okay?

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.950
And I say, okay, so here is a click stream

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.270
of a customer going through and clicking our UI.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:03.560
Tell me how you are able to personally identify this person.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.910
Who are they?

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:11.070
And anything you can tell me about that person is fine.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.390
Like where they live, what their phone number is,

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.670
their name, their middle name,

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:20.730
any information that helps to triangulate who they are.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.690
And they're like, well, I can't.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.350
Guess what?

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.990
Not personally identifiable information.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.830
Right.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.110
So let's back out a level,

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.430
because that one pisses me off and annoys me.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:35.550
It's not.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.110
So how do we get someone started?

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:42.110
Like if your team does not collect any data,

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:46.020
any customer data, there are a couple challenges here.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.490
There's a technical challenge of picking whatever

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.570
off the shelf solution there is to get some of that data,

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.810
whether it's Google Analytics for a webpage,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.560
or I don't even know what exists

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.790
in the open source world for a desktop app.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:06.640
But the technical part, what do you collect?

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.680
I know the answers to these,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.200
but how do you get the team started?

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.920
You have a team who don't care about it

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.520
because they haven't collected it.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.570
How do we take a team?

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.930
How do we lead a team towards no data

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.410
to collecting customer data

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.410
that affects decisions in the org?

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.460
So it's interesting.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.460
Yesterday, I had a developer from a team

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.420
that I know very little about.

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.510
They had raised, I'll just cut to short.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.110
One of the things that's very common,

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:50.670
maybe once a month and once every two months,

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:54.030
I will do a one-off mentorship session

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.110
with somebody I've never met before,

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.990
and I have no idea how they found me.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.750
That happened yesterday.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.750
And he is a developer, just graduated college

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:11.070
in May with a bachelor's in computer science.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.710
And he took one stats and ML course.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:17.590
And he came to me, wanted to know,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.110
how do I become a data scientist when I grow up?

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.190
One of the things I told him,

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.750
I'm not gonna go through the whole thing

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.830
because the premise is slightly different

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:30.950
than what you're talking about,

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.540
but I actually think the implementation might be useful,

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.380
is I said, okay, so you're a new guy.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:42.340
And as you know, well, I don't know if this is universal,

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.340
but at Microsoft, new guys in dev,

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.140
new people in dev.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.220
Thank you.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.540
Yep.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.660
We'll spend probably the first six months

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.660
spending 80% of their time just fixing bugs.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.730
That's how they get their feet wet.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.820
And I said, all right, here is a thought process for you.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.540
This is what I want you to think through.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.860
For every one of your bug fixes,

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.980
once it goes to production,

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.980
how do you know whether or not

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:28.580
this added value to your customer and or your business

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.290
or just wasted your time?

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:33.250
That's it.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.570
That's the question I laid on this plate.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.490
And I said, how do you know that?

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:43.560
And then I followed up and I said,

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.800
you're probably gonna dive into it and realize

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.240
you don't have the right data,

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.400
which is gonna force you to have a conversation around

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.760
or at least a thought process around

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.760
what data do I need in order to make those two choices?

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.160
If you try to simplify,

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.880
did I waste my time on this bug fix

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.970
or did I add value?

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:11.100
But the key thing there is you have to be able to prove it.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.900
Because a lot of the times dev goes,

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.420
oh, I'm sure we added value.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.340
Look, it was a whatever.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:23.140
And I said, once you do that and you do it repeatedly,

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.500
you'll learn from your mistakes.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.640
You're like, crap,

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.380
I can't statistically prove that I did it now.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.020
That would be probably less than three.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.300
Great, the trend's looking better, but is it relevant?

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.500
What I did is I said,

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:44.500
I framed the mission in a way that resonated with him,

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.380
that the more he could proactively determine

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.710
without intuition or opinion in play,

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:56.630
whether or not he wasted his time,

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.630
that would play out well for him in the long-term.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.140
Anyway, is that at all helpful

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.260
or is it me yet again blubiating?

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.750
I think there's some nuggets in there.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:13.710
The question I asked,

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.190
the opposite version of the question,

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.660
which is how will you know customers

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.500
are being successful with this feature?

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.020
Well, it's not the opposite.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.780
It's the same question except now on features.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.980
Sure.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.660
Right, you just spent six months doing this feature.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.260
Are customers successful or did you waste your time?

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.420
I hope it's not six months.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.700
I hope it's not six months.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.340
That helps you figure out,

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.980
there's some brainstorming around that

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.900
that helps you figure out what you can measure.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.420
There may be a topic in there.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.780
I have a meta question.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.780
So there's one is teaching developers to test.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.660
One is really getting started with data

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.940
and maybe a little deeper

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.780
because I kind of covered that.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.900
In fact, I use that question in the intro course as well.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.140
But what else do you think is stopping teams

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.020
from moving to modern testing?

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.660
Tradition I think is the number one.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.460
The fact that in general,

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.540
I don't think that the test org has ever

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:23.140
done a great job answering

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.740
the implied questions around principle number one

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.460
is way up there.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.690
Yes, and I've pointed to it a few times

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.290
in one of the three dots, slack.com,

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.370
go to moderntesting.org to find an invitation link.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.090
But I wrote an article last year,

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.370
year before I can't remember just fighting this.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.210
We always hear about the cost of software testing,

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.610
which is the opposite of principle one.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.410
So I forget the title of the article.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:58.210
I will not probably forget to post a link to it

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:00.970
in the notes, but I wrote an article

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:06.510
for CIO Tech on the value add of good testing.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:10.870
Didn't say testers, I say good testing.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.550
It's not a cost, it's a value add.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.700
Well, not by itself, it's not.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.760
Just doing a bunch of, well, I guess, nevermind.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.800
Because you qualified it by the word good testing

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.340
and more likely than not,

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.820
if we were to drill down that, you and I would agree on it.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.100
I think there's something there.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.740
I have to remember, I want four,

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.740
and this is not in the short term,

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.500
it's batting around in the back of my head.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:46.980
I do wanna do something, a workshop that dives deeper

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.380
into how to make these things happen.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.260
But as I talk through it,

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.060
the gusto's going away a little bit

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:04.060
because really what you need is leadership skills.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.990
You need to be able to influence change

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:09.110
and get people to care about what you're doing

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:13.170
and think what you're saying and trying to do is valid.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.250
That's probably the most important thing.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.730
We didn't cover it in either of our two stories.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:24.170
There are two things that really solidified

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.330
what we now call modern testing for me.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.970
Number one is my own personal experience

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:32.450
of managing a dev team without any sort of testing.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:37.580
Okay, but number two,

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:42.740
it's the agile principle around removing waste from the system

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.860
and how valuable that is.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.860
And in order to be able to do that,

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.700
you have to be able to confidently identify waste.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.420
And the thing that really resonated with me on that one

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.540
was the Eric Rhee story.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.380
Yes.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.460
He had his whole company.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.460
They spent six months working 40 hour days

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.780
to produce this one value add system

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:17.620
that at that point in time, they all were true believers.

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.980
They all in that organization believed.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.700
None of them had any data, but they all believed

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.090
that of course it must be true that this would be a hit.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:32.030
And they got 20 downloads the day they shipped, right?

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:33.510
It was an abject failure.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:37.550
They had misunderstood the problem

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:41.670
their customer needed solved.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.950
And I happened to see a presentation.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:45.470
Eric Rhee came here to Microsoft

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:48.360
and I happened to see him to present.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.760
And he's like, you know, I replayed that whole six months

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.160
over and over and over again.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.920
And I realized something,

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.680
that if on the day one that we started this,

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:06.140
if we had created a mock-up webpage that said,

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.500
hey, welcome to Eric Rhee's magic project,

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.350
click here to download.

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:17.410
They could have discovered that same day

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.010
just by putting that fake facade up

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:22.330
to see if there was any demand here.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:25.050
And I remember like yesterday, the question he asked,

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.680
and by the way folks,

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.000
would I have had to implement that download page

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.590
or would a 404 just been fine?

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:35.910
We've told that story before.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:36.950
I think it's good.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.910
And maybe one of the things is to,

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:40.990
you have to wear a little bit

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:45.830
of that project management hat in order to get past,

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.510
of course there's the fallacy of now,

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.230
what I'm working on now has to be,

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.710
customers have to have it,

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:53.150
and failure to launch, which is this case

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.310
of spending too much time waiting for customer feedback.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:01.510
We do not have time for a rebuttal.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:04.230
We're gonna have to call, okay, go on.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.630
No, I was just going to agree.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.990
That's exactly right.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.980
It's not even waiting for too much time.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.980
No matter how much time you wait for feedback,

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.070
how do you make it faster?

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:23.070
Because that's how you eliminate waste from the system.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.790
Yeah, it's speeding up the feedback cycle.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:28.550
So maybe there's something there.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:32.430
I would love to hear back from the three.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:36.790
You can either reply to the Twitter post announcing this,

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:39.350
the LinkedIn post announcing this.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:40.750
You can add comments.

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:42.910
You can send us mails.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:48.100
You can poke us on Slack and let us know what you think

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.500
we should be doing for the community

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.420
to help them get even further with modern testing.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.660
And I'll try and coagulate that

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.340
into some sort of workshop.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.620
That's my plan.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.740
Thanks for a workshop and that with me a little bit, Brett.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:04.580
Sure.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.500
We will chat again in a couple of weeks.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.700
Is that right?

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.420
Post election?

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.860
Yeah, well, that's the plan, right?

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.900
We'll see if we're both still here.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.620
We both live in the hated suburbia.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.620
So, right, we'll see what happens.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.060
Okay, thanks everyone for listening this far.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:24.980
I'm Alan.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.820
I'm Brett.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.660
See you next time.
