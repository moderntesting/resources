00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
This is what it's like every week now.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.480
I just try and figure out what the hell Brent is talking about.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.350
Welcome to A.B.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.350
Testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.110
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.350
leadership, agile and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.710
Now on with the show.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.640
Hey, everyone.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.720
I'll leave you.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.040
Hey, you were talking to people out there.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.960
Yeah, I don't know who I'm talking to.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.400
I'm talking to you. I'm Alan.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.240
I'm here with Brent and we have a guest, a guest of Brent.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.520
Brent, introduce your guest.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.360
Introduce our guest.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.640
We have a fantastic guest today.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.000
To be determined.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.200
No, just kidding.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.480
He's going to hang up on it.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.600
You are going both ways.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.640
That's good.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.600
I will say there's this old phrase where it says,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.160
never meet your heroes because they will always let you down.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.800
Al Shalloway joins us today.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.240
He has been a hero of mine for a very long time.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.700
And it's interesting because our topic today is going to be about agile

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.780
and particularly around safe.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.540
Cue Alan's mailbag jingle.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.220
Mailbag.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.170
It's where actually, so I've been following Al for a long time.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.140
It doesn't work for the podcast, but I have in my hand one of the most important books in my library.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.220
Design Patterns Explained.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.300
Hey, you need to get the second edition.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.900
It's much better than the first one.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.100
And you know, it's funny.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.140
It's even signed by Al Shalloway and it says you need to get the second edition.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.580
Okay, so don't buy it.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.940
Brent, I'm going to buy a copy, sign it, and I'm going to send it to your next time we meet

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.620
because you do need the second edition.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.260
The second edition, I talk about how patterns can be used in an agile environment.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.380
I was just figuring that out when I wrote the first edition.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.500
I think I'm going to wait for the third edition.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.860
But if you want what the equivalent of the third edition is, follow Scott Bain.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.940
Unfortunately, he doesn't write, he just teaches.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.220
But Scott Bain, David Bernstein, oh, maybe look at David Bernstein's book,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.700
who worked with me for a while.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.300
He's very smart, very good trainer.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.740
And he's got a book, I forget the title of it.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.820
And it's been influenced by my work, but David's really good.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.580
Well, we'll see about whether or not there'll be a third edition after.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.780
I don't know, you might inspire me.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.300
After I'm done talking with you.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.420
Yeah, I already know what the third edition is going to be about.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.420
And it's going to be very similar to some of the other discussions we're having now.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.580
So, design patterns explained.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.460
I was thinking about this today.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.060
So, we weren't intending to have a discussion around design patterns.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.540
But I was thinking about this today around lost arts that should be brought back.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.940
And I was thinking, so the three of you.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.500
The three are three listeners?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.420
The three of you.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.660
And sadly, I'm counting, I'm looking at the three cameras I'm seeing.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.220
Of course, one of those three is in fact, me.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.060
This is what it's like every week now.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.220
I just try and figure out what the hell Brent is talking about.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.380
Oh, I knew what he was saying right from the beginning.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.820
Outnumbered here.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.620
What am I going to do?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.380
Yeah, it's so the other thing I'll say about Al is if for some reason I ever need to get a replacement

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.020
for an A in A-B testing, I know exactly who it will be.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.070
Brent's making himself laugh.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.270
Unfortunately, the most relevant B, I think in the industry for Alan there is

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.950
not someone you would really work with.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.430
It could be the ABB podcast.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.390
I can bring them both on.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.520
Anyway, move on to more relevant topics.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.320
Moving on.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.280
And I would like to point out that we have a topic.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.740
We do.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.020
I just don't know what it is yet.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.860
Oh my God, shut up.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.980
So Al, I should have warned you about beforehand.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.260
Like one of the feedback about our podcast is it sounds like two guys bullshitting over beer.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.260
And that's kind of the theme and you should just join into the party.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.820
I think you did warn me about that, by the way.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.140
Okay.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.260
I'll be quiet.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.230
So I'm thinking about Lost Arts.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:10.110
And one of the things I was thinking about is it was the last time I've had a cogent

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.630
context sensitive conversation around design patterns.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.210
And it's been a long time.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:26.370
Well, you know, we should get together and bring Scott Bainen and maybe have David on a Zoom

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.730
and Jim Trott, maybe do it as a Zoom.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.330
Although four of those people are in the area here and you'd get a very cogent one.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.500
Because I have them every now and then, but there are only a few people.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.420
I hate to say it this way.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.460
I mean, when I say a few, I don't mean five, but I mean from a percentage point of view,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.780
not that many people truly understand patterns.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.180
So it's hard to get a true cogent conversation because people think the important part of

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.740
patterns is they are solutions to recurring problems in a context.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.220
And that's the least valuable aspect of them, although it's very, very valuable.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:10.060
Well, so let's sort of segue into the primary topic that given that.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.100
I can bring this into actually, because I've given it some fun.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:19.820
Because I think actually, my view, the main problem with patterns is because they're meta,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.780
right?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.740
And meta kind of merges into system thinking.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.460
And people have struggled, I think, with sort of system thinking.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.260
Now, the primary reason we asked Al on today, and much like the three listeners we have,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.060
are aware we're going to probably go all over the place.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:55.650
But we had a mailbag question around, it was from already one of the active listeners on

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.450
the Slack channel.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.890
Where's your question?

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:04.770
She asked, Brent, you've mentioned that you find safe, not as bad as everyone thinks.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.150
I would be interesting to know how you make the most of it.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
And what are the things to be aware of?

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.590
Thanks.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.830
Right now, one of the things, and I believe this to be true.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.630
So I was the first Microsofty to get certified and safe.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.850
And Al actually was at this, I think you got certified at the same time I did, right?

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.730
No, I was certified.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.850
I never took a training to be certified, or I might have taken a training.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.380
Oh, I was actually certified before I took the training.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.940
The agreement, though, by Dean was that I would take the workshop.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.930
The reason Dean made an exception for me is prior to the launch of safe,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.410
he and myself and Alan Cheddlewada, our president at NetObjectives, the three of us

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:07.650
had done probably half of the successful agile adoptions that had taken place in the 2000s,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.290
like up until about 2010 or 11.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.290
And we decided to partner together.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.530
So he knew I knew a lot about agile at scale.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:21.650
So what happened is he kind of said, okay, you're SPC, you have to take the exam later.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:29.890
And I was the first SPCT trainer outside of SAI, again, somewhat given special dispensation,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.450
because he knew I knew how to do at scale.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:40.850
And what's interesting is one of the first safe adoptions I did was at Northwestern Mutual.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.970
I can mention this because they had us do a case study there and all that.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.370
But I never have done safe the way safe says to do safe.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.050
In fact, they were always giving me a hassle about it, where I said,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.730
well, this is how I'm doing this implementation.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.410
They say, well, that's not how we like to do it.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.850
And I'd get into a 15-minute conversation with no progress made until I would finally say,

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.490
well, are you telling me I have to do something that's not in the best interest of the customer?

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.890
And to their credit, they would always stop arguing with me then

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.130
about what I was wanting to do.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.290
And then I would do what I want.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.130
And I added a lot of things to safe.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.410
And I didn't do it all in all the way, like they talked about.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.090
I prepared people properly.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.450
I knew how to talk to management.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.730
But I never really did what I totally wanted to do,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.970
because there's a lot missing in safe.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.770
And that's eventually why I left, is I couldn't get them to put what's missing.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:38.690
And I couldn't get them to change what's really kind of archaic and structured badly.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:44.290
And so eventually, I left after three or four years of using a variant of it.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.050
So people?

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.850
Yeah.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.370
So on that, like, so what?

00:09:51.810 --> 00:10:01.950
So I am a fan of many of the techniques that safe brings in.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:08.270
Like the planning event, I just think is absolutely wonderful.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.940
I love that whole process.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:21.340
But the primary feedback I hear from people or the opponents of safe

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.780
is it's just far too complex, right?

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.100
There's far too many pieces.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.580
It's far too many things to understand.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.900
And from my own personal training of people to shift to like a Kanban, right?

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.060
I end up getting that same sort of feedback when I'm just trying to introduce people to Kanban.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.060
Which I think is actually relatively easy to understand, right?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:54.220
Versus something that's so very prescriptive, like scrum.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.780
So I'll just yield to you.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:03.600
But what do you think is the real positive and the negative of safe?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.080
So let me ask you this, because I tend to talk too much, as I think you know.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.960
But if you give me five minutes of just kind of creating a background,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.680
I think I can tie design patterns, timeless way of building,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.880
and the mindset of safe, and then how you do that and explain what's good and what's bad.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.720
So do I have kind of five minutes to do that?

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.000
Yes.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.600
Okay, so let me, Chris Alexander, one of the most impactful books I've ever read is by Chris

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.080
Alexander, wrote Timeless Way of Building.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.480
Now, a lot of people say you need to read a pattern language.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.680
And that's a good book too.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.280
But Timeless Way of Building is the real thought process underneath all of his work.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.520
And then a pattern language is an example of it.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:43.680
Yeah.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.480
And if you're going to read Timeless Way of Building, I'll make a recommendation.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.760
First of all, get a hard copy.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.320
There is a free PDF you can find somewhere on the web.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.200
But get a hard copy.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.800
There's something about that book.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.640
And I'm a massive Kindle fan.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.360
So I typically always have soft copies.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.200
But the Timeless Way of Building is somehow looking at the pictures,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.720
having it in your hand makes a difference.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.520
And read the italics first, which is just an hour or two.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.080
Read the whole thing.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.080
You'll get the concept, then go back and read it.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.840
At your leisure.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.160
But the really important part of Timeless Way of Building to me

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.430
was how you do design.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.310
And he talks about how the way people design normally is you find your pieces

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.590
and then you put them together.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.510
And he's talking about this.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.510
And I'm saying to myself, I was reading this like in 94, 95, 96, something like that.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.390
And I remember thinking to myself, yeah, that's how I design.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.950
But then the very next word on the next paragraph says,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.030
but I said, oh crap, he's going to tell me I'm wrong.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.150
And he did.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.330
He said, when you design that way, then the pieces are preformed

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.690
and they don't fit in the context of how you're putting things together.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.250
He says it a different way, but that's really what he meant.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.940
And what I realized, and I saw this in practice,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.620
because I was having some troubles solving some problems.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.260
And when I shifted into the way he was saying things,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.900
I realized it's just solved the problem right away.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.860
The idea is you look at the whole and you decompose it

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.420
by looking at the relationships between things.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.460
And then those relationships give you like,

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.100
and I'll use the business agility as an example.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.540
And a lot of organizations, doesn't have to be this way, but in most it is.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.580
There's a business part and a development part.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.060
I'm not suggesting this is what you want.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.500
I'm just suggesting this is how it is.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.380
And when you decompose, say, well, here's a pattern.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.380
I got a business part and talking to a development part.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.660
What you do is you now have not only decomposed the system

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.020
and actually systems thinking tells us we can't decompose the system

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.500
except in this case, we're decomposing it with the relationship present.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.500
How does business relate to development?

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.380
Because as Russ Aikoff tells us,

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.380
systems are more about the relationships between the pieces, not the pieces.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.380
You could get the best parts of the best cars,

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.300
put them together, you have a pile of junk.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.660
But if you get all the pieces together working,

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.020
it's systems thinking tells us the way the system works together

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.620
is the system behavior.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.300
So the key of Alexander's approach is you take the whole

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.420
and you don't decompose it into the pieces.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.180
You decompose it into the sets of relationships between the pieces.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:20.220
Now, when you do this, when you do this, something interesting happens.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:26.100
How does say business, well, business has like the discovery and product management

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.900
and intake and all that.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.420
How does that part relate to the other?

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.460
So you keep breaking it down to use as the metaphor of an embryo continuing to split.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.100
So now the question is, well, how can product management talk to development?

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.940
Well, there are a lot of issues there.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.380
What's the size of the pieces handing over?

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.180
Who's involved?

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.380
Are there people on both sides?

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.180
How do they work together?

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.460
These are like the forces.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.340
He calls all the, they're about a dozen of them in this particular thing.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.020
And what a pattern is, in fact, I've built the discipline Agile Value Stream

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.020
consultant workshop is based on this notion.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.780
And thanks to you, Brent, a lot of this happened

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.380
because you said break everything down into patterns several years ago.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.700
And I use that I've been meaning to thank you for that, by the way.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.180
So here I get this, thank you publicly.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.140
Thank you for that.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.380
That was a big influence on me.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.060
So now what you have is you have patterns that talk about how to solve this problem.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.700
And there are dozens of ways to solve this problem.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.740
And one of the other patterns, and there is the planning event.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.160
Now, SAFE has a particular way of doing a planning event.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.000
And the planning event has a lot of forces in it.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.320
One is what comes in, what comes out.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.040
There's a social force in the planning event.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.080
One of the coolest things about the SAFE planning event

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.360
has nothing to do with planning.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.200
It has to do with the social aspect of everybody getting together and talking to things.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.440
OK.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.880
Now, that being said, I got another couple of minutes,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.880
and then I'll get into specifics on SAFE.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.160
So we've got this different patterns, different number of patterns,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
comprising how the whole system works.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.840
And each pattern is a solution to a recurring problem in a context,

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.720
which means planning is a solution.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.680
It's a pattern for figuring out what you're going to do over some period of time.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.680
Flow planning would almost be no planning,

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.880
just letting something came in first in, first out or by priority.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.240
Or massive planning, like, say, for you have three months,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.760
or the way I like to plan if I'm in a big organization,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.400
is you find those things that need long planning,

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.680
but you can run in parallel, short-term planning with a common cadence.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.280
I mean, there are any number of ways of doing these.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.160
All of these are the same pattern.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.040
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.200
Different implementations of the same pattern called planning,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.520
and it's got these different issues I've already mentioned,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.560
the half a dozen of them.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.200
So summing up Alexander, I've got the way to look at the whole system,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.640
breaking it into relationships,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.040
and then the relationship can be a pattern to solve.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.890
And then I've got different ways of implementing it.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.650
Okay, now how does this relate to SAFE?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.340
Well, SAFE, if you're a really large organization,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.100
like a thousand people plus,

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.060
it actually attends to some things,

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.260
maybe well, maybe not,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.460
but it attends to some things nobody else is attending to.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.150
As Don Reinertson once told me when I asked him about

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.750
something like how well this is being done,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.350
I think it was Wade's shortest job first.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.110
And I said, well, how about, well, do you really think they're doing?

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.630
This was years ago. They've improved this.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.310
So this is not a judgment by Don.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.990
But I liked what he said.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.790
He said, well, on a scale of one to 10,

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.030
maybe there are two, but they're the only ones talking about it.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.150
So they're first.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.830
At least they bring it to consciousness.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.190
And this is what is at least a powerful thing.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.550
SAFE's looking at the whole.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.070
There's power to looking at the whole.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.870
The problem though with SAFE, in my mind,

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.210
is they deal with a lot of stuff at the team level

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.650
and what they call essential SAFE.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.570
And they don't do that badly except

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.330
they do everything at scale, whether you need it or not.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.690
So companies with less than 50 people are using SAFE,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.890
which is absurd because that's like taking out a mallet,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.370
ball peen hammer, so to speak,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.570
to put a nail in the wall.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.010
It's just way more than needed.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.450
But if you need to get teams coordinated,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.850
the question then is how do you coordinate them?

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.410
So the common way is people take the teams and combine them.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.250
Well, that goes against Alexander's approach.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.930
We don't take components and put them together

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.730
and make a system.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.370
SAFE's method of looking at the whole,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.690
the problem with that is the way they structure it.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.140
So SAFE has some good things,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.260
but they also are missing things

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.300
and the structures are on.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:27.700
Okay, sorry.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.900
This is probably more than five minutes already,

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.260
but I am going to wrap it up here.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.860
Frameworks, let's look at frameworks.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.940
And then we can relate to SAFE.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.060
I think there are three aspects to frameworks

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.940
that are very important.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.820
One is what is the mindset it's based on?

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.990
Like Scrum is based on,

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.710
well, we'll create a kind of a framework

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.230
within what you figure out what you do,

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.030
and you can't change our holding pattern,

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.270
our umbrella for you to figure things out.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.750
And then they think it's not prescriptive

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.350
because while you fill it in,

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.270
except what they ignore is the framework itself

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.790
is prescriptive because you got to use

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.110
timeboxing and you've got to use cross-functional teams.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.950
Other frameworks have different mindsets.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.550
You know, waterfall isn't the framework,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.430
but it's got a mindset.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.630
Well, so what's the mindset of SAFE?

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.630
Well, we're going to put everything in your work.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.150
If it's been useful at one point,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:13.950
we're going to stick it in.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.790
We don't care how complicated it is.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.190
We've got essential portfolio, different levels.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.350
So mindset is very important.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.460
Then there's structure.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.030
They conflate this.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.030
There's what I call a decision framework.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.110
Like how do you decide what you're going to do?

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.310
Well, SAFE and Scrum tell you.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.910
So they have a decision framework,

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.270
but it's called Ken Jeff and Dean.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.670
And they've decided what you're going to do.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.150
And then what they teach you is what I call a working framework,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.430
looking for a better name, by the way,

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.470
than working framework,

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.150
but that's what I'm calling it right now.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.990
Like the Scrum Guide is a working framework,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.590
how they figured out those patterns as,

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.590
well, they just figured that out themselves.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.790
But this is what you do.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.870
Now, personally, I think decision frameworks

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.550
and working frameworks need to be unconflated.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.430
That word means, in other words,

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.990
what I do is I work with a decision framework

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.430
and I teach people the decision framework.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.390
And I can have a starting working framework if they want,

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.150
because sometimes people, hey, just tell me what to do.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.550
Okay, great.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.070
Here's a starting working framework.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.830
By the way, here's how I got there.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.630
And I teach that.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.470
So if they want to start with the working framework,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.150
they can, but then they can adjust it later

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.390
to get a fit for purpose thing they need.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.070
And then the third thing are practices.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.910
Now, the problem is, in our world,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.590
everybody's just looking at the practices.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.670
They're not looking at the mindset.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.830
They're not looking at that there's this conflation

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.950
of decision and working frameworks.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.790
So when you look at SAFE, some of the practices are really cool.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.950
But the mindset and the structure is bad.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.230
SAFE starts at the essential SAFE and then builds it up.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.510
And what you really need to do is not work at the levels.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.750
It's not bottom up or top down or both top down and bottom up.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.350
Do you notice how that fits the hierarchy?

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.070
That's all hierarchical, the conversation.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.870
Top down management leads, bottom up works.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:02.350
That's all.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.790
I'm talking hierarchy.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.190
Yep.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.470
If there's one thing we've learned from flow and lean

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.590
and theory of constraints,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.310
don't look at the organization's hierarchy.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.670
Look at the value stream.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.860
So all these other methods that are yelling at each other

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.060
are missing the point.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.420
They're doing the wrong thing wrong.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.850
Or they say the other person is doing the wrong thing.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.090
But they're both in the wrong space.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:30.690
So we move from waterfall to agile, as it is now mostly proposed,

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.410
where we're trying to do hierarchical structures in a better way

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.290
instead of saying, no, we need to focus totally on value streams,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.450
operational value streams, how the customer does things.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.330
So this is where we get things complicated.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.610
Because we're trying to look at an entire organization

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.130
in a component part, putting it together,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.130
looking at the hierarchy, we're looking at the wrong thing.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.410
So you can have good practices,

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.090
but the whole piece doesn't work that well.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.770
So anyway, that was more than five.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.570
I'm going to go ahead and build on that.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.370
Thank you for that.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.370
And I think you hinted at some of the things

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.650
that come into my arguments against SAFE.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.010
And SAFE, for those of you who haven't heard of it,

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.690
is scaled agile framework.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.690
I think the E stands for nothing.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.610
You hit on a couple things I want to reiterate.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.850
One is some teams use SAFE when they don't need to use SAFE.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.370
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:21.250
And also SAFE isn't the only way you work in a large organization.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.090
When you have a large organization

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.650
all working roughly on the same thing,

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.290
that's when agile needs to scale.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.730
There are other ways to scale.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.850
For example, we have a team where I work of roughly 500 developers,

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:42.450
but they work on 60 different things that sometimes interact,

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.250
but sometimes don't.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.850
They're not shipping a monolith.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.410
So they don't have to scale agile.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.330
They can all just do agile on their own.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.650
The other point you brought up or hinted at,

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.970
maybe you did say directly,

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.890
is that people get caught up in the framework.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.450
And you said that not the value stream, not the results.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.610
SAFE is one example of that.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.290
There is some good stuff in SAFE.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.050
I think people get off it.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.610
It doesn't work.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.690
People get frustrated because they get caught up

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.050
in doing SAFE versus being agile.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.610
And at the same, at a lower scale,

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.050
I'm sure you've seen,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.570
because I've seen it a bunch of times

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.170
and I know Brent's seen it.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.650
Teams focusing on doing agile,

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.250
versus the value stream or adaptive delivery.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.210
They get caught up in doing the stuff.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.970
And Scrum, oh my God, I hate Scrum so much

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:32.690
because it's abuse.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.090
Teams are so focused on doing Scrum

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:40.240
that all they're doing is little mini waterfalls

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.680
focused on a bunch of rituals

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.960
and they're not getting the value out of them.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.760
They skip the only ones that they like skip retros,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.960
which is like the most viable meeting you can have in there.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.760
So with I hate, I don't say I hate,

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.120
that's a hard word.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.360
My arguments against SAFE are similar

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.440
to my arguments about teams,

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.600
how teams, I'm almost done here, Brent.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.720
I have a little more tangent to do here.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.520
You can have your turn.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.440
Is that teams, they get stuck trying to do the thing

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.160
versus delivering software.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.920
And what really, really boils my bones.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.960
So I could write a blog post about why I don't like SAFE

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.960
and someone would say, well, you're doing it wrong.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.960
And they'd be absolutely right.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.640
And if I had a dollar for every article on the internet saying,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.680
Agile is a fad and it doesn't work and here's why,

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.080
and they describe some horribly implemented version of Agile

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.880
that just came right out of someone's butt,

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.880
I could retire a freaking billionaire today.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.920
So I tease Brent about SAFE.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.480
And I think the reason is not because SAFE is inherently bad.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.120
I think SAFE is in some situations and done well.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.160
It could work really well.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.360
I think Brent's seen that.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.720
But I also think it gives people a whole bunch of process

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.560
to hide behind where they can focus on doing the process

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.600
versus actually delivering value to their customers.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.000
And that's my soapbox on the topic for now.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.400
Brent.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.840
Yeah, thank you.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.120
I will say at this point in time,

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.950
any Agile system can be abused.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.030
I think you take Agile out of that.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.390
Any system can be abused.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:29.550
Well, yeah, the note, the like, as Al was talking

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:35.230
and I was thinking through, right, I am a fan of SAFE.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.150
But I realized as he was talking, why?

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:44.720
Because it's not because of the implementations.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.960
The practices within SAFE.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.360
Since I started my Agile journey,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.400
I've kind of viewed SAFE as sort of a grab bag

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:06.110
of successful practices that can be connected, disconnected,

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:14.350
reconnected in a way to help me better accelerate

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.260
the achievement of shippable quality products.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.380
Right?

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:28.770
Like, I actually, I no longer actually honestly even view Scrum as Agile,

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.730
even though I'm a minority, like the world, I think.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.690
And actually, I'm gonna pause here for a moment.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:40.210
And Al, you'll remember for sure, but I am 95% positive that Scrum

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.250
was around before the Agile Manifesto.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.290
Yeah, it was 95.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.610
So I actually, let me inject something here.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.050
So Scrum came out in 95.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.490
And there's a recurring theme both of you are saying,

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.810
but not pointing out and I want to point it out.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.290
And that is the metaphor of the map is not the territory.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.040
So before, there was Agile before the manifesto

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.800
for Agile software development.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.960
By the way, there are two very important,

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.720
three very important words there.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.800
Manifestos by their nature are a time specific statement

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.400
saying we need to change.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.800
And it's absurd to me that 20 years later,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.640
when the opening words are we are discovering new ways,

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.840
and 20 years later, we're still using that as the basis is absurd.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.040
Also, it's software development.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.040
No, no, we're more interested in the bigger picture now.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.720
Software development is very narrow focus.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.000
But the map is not the territory.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.680
The manifesto for Agile software development is the map.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.320
The territory is this effectiveness.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.360
They just put some words around it that before it came out,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.680
there were many of us trying to work on this.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:51.040
Scrum tries to conflate itself with Agile repeatedly.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.000
It's a path.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.880
It's a map to the territory of Agile.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.840
Safe is a map to the territory of Agile,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.840
but safe's a harder one to wield

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.480
because it's a bigger territory and a bigger heavy map.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.960
So this conflation is killing Agile.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.640
People, and you mentioned this,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.840
like then they're trying to follow safe.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.440
They're trying to follow Scrum.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.160
And what you have is the Agile community.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.020
Well, what does that even mean?

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.500
Because if you've got a whole bunch of maps out there

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.060
where people are pretending this is what we're trying to do,

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.500
and there's all these assumptions.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.020
One last thing, and then I'll shut up

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.980
to let you talk for a minute.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.940
But you said systems can be abused.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.580
That's true.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.520
But you know what?

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.240
Systems can also be designed to be abused.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.080
Scrum is designed, not intentionally,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.000
but the design of Scrum leads to the abuse of Scrum.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.680
The design of safe leads to the abuse of safe.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.280
And what you want to look at is,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.400
why do we get these repeated failures,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.800
these patterns of repeated failure?

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.480
And a lot of that is because people have ignored

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.840
this distinction between there's a way to make decisions

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.360
and then there's using decisions.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.000
And Scrum in particular traps you

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.240
because it makes some assumption saying

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.680
you have to use these methods

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.040
or you're not doing Scrum.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.840
That's time-boxing.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.360
People say, oh, we're not prescripted.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.400
Hell, you are.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.760
You have to use time-boxing.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.450
You have to use cross-functional teams.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.490
Not saying those are bad things,

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.690
but they don't always apply.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.330
So if systems repeatedly have people misusing them,

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:28.690
you need to, if those people who are proposing proponents

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.530
of Scrum and safe and they're being misused,

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:31.490
then they have to be,

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.370
take responsibility for why that happens.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.810
I'm not saying blame, but you got to look at,

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:36.530
well, why does it happen?

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.130
How can I make it so it doesn't happen?

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:43.250
So given that my loathing of Scrum and my concern

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.210
of safe are similar in nature,

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.290
and this question for Al, I guess for both of you.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.370
I like what you said.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.570
They're designed whether by intent or not for abuse.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:57.250
They're also very complex systems, each of them,

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.210
relative to just something as simple

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.890
as frequent customer delivery at a sustainable pace.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.330
Do you think it's the complexity of those systems

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.530
that leads to the abuse,

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.450
or is it just because we abuse all systems?

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.650
I think people abuse all systems,

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:18.160
but see, they look at the wrong thing.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.650
The question is, what's simple?

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.770
Is it simple to understand?

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.650
Is it simple to use?

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.010
Was it simple to be designed?

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.290
There are all these aspects of it.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.400
What Scrum and safe are both based around are practices.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.280
Instead of what makes for effective value stream management.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.820
It's not surprising to me that the Scrum community

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.740
has embraced complexity.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.340
Because if you're in a complex system

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.900
where you have no hope of ever getting it under control,

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.860
then you've basically abdicated your responsibility

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.860
for figuring out how to get it under control.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:59.250
I believe it's possible to make a lot of improvement

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.650
in a very understandable way.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.170
Okay, I got a lot of this from,

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.330
I was actually working on this for about 15 years

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.650
before I read The Choice by Eli Goldratt.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.170
Now, a lot of people have read The Goal,

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.450
which is a phenomenal book.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.050
I think The Choice is even better.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.290
Because in The Choice, he says,

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.810
yeah, systems look complex.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.970
And if you go into them as if they're complex,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:18.770
you're going to have problems,

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.850
because then you look for complex solutions.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.810
Or actually, I think Scrum isn't complex.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:24.930
I think it's simplistic.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.290
But it results in complex behavior

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.290
because it doesn't deal with the right things.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.130
So what Goldratt talks about is,

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.050
how do you look at these systems in a way

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.770
where you can see what's going on?

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.890
And he's not saying you can

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.730
deterministically figure things out.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.170
I mean, nobody's that stupid.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.010
I mean, I've been accused of being a flat-earther

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.610
because I get interpreted as I'm saying,

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.850
I can look into a system, see what's going on.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.290
Well, shit, I know, excuse my language,

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.690
I know that I can't deterministically

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:53.730
figure out what's going on.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.450
But what I do know is that there are many things

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.210
that are levers of the system.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.050
And if I can pay attention to those,

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.090
I'll get things better.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.770
And the complexity decreases

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.530
because I can see the nonsense my teams are causing,

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.690
or my customers' teams are causing,

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.410
by working overloaded, planning too long,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:12.930
not having visibility to work,

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.130
working on big things.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.370
There are about eight or nine things

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.810
you got to really pay attention to.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.650
I call these factors sore effectiveness.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.990
And once you start noticing that,

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.110
and you go back to the relationships I mentioned,

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.630
what happens is, see, the reason systems are,

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.310
the reason complexity hurts us

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.470
is because it hides things.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.710
We can't see these relationships.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:36.990
In a system with 100 things,

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.910
with 100 things relating to 100 things,

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.790
and one relationship affects another relationship.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.030
So you get, I can't handle this.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.950
I got 100 times factorial,

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.790
and each of those affect everything else.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.550
It's easy to get overwhelmed.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.990
But if what you say is, yes,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.990
but some of those are stronger than others,

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.070
and I can't see them all,

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.670
but if I see the significant ones

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.790
and I make an improvement,

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.110
like having a gating process for work coming in

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.350
so I don't overload teams, managing my cues,

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.390
what happens is, I either get improvement,

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.710
or I learn about a relationship

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.830
I either didn't see

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.190
or didn't know how it behaved.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.590
So if what you do is get improvement or learn,

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.110
well, learning is an improvement,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.990
because now, again,

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.910
my decision framework can improve.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.430
So this working just on practices

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.430
without any understanding of the model

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.710
is what causes this weird behavior we get.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.110
And that's just inherent in both safe and scrum.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.470
So let me add in a couple of comments,

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.270
and then I guess I have a couple of questions for you.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.950
So it's been a couple of years.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.990
So I was doing Agile transformations

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.150
within Microsoft several years ago,

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.190
and I was doing one or two a quarter.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.070
But most of those were sort of waterfall

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.670
to Agile shifts.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.070
Right. And one of the things

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:02.160
that I found was really important over time

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.480
is that one of my first slides

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.870
is to describe Agile and say,

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.750
Agile has nothing to do with speed.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.030
That is not your goal.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.710
Speed is not your goal.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.780
The reason why it's called Agile

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.270
is about adaptability.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.870
How do you very quickly respond?

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.290
The one of the problems I have,

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:29.810
for example, was scrum.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.050
People say, oh, we use scrum.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.570
I'm like, oh, okay, great.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.170
So when you complete your story,

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.890
like, what do you do with the customer feedback?

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:39.890
Oh, we don't we don't have customer feedback.

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:41.170
And I'm like, okay,

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.730
you're just using scrum to do mini waterfall.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:44.850
You're driving me crazy.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.520
Like that. Now, the thing I found also

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.160
as I was going through my own personal coaching work,

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.520
the thing I found is that Agile itself

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.770
really is an advanced topic

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:07.650
because what I find is Agile is a series of principles

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:08.770
that you got to hold true,

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.410
but there could be multiple implementations

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.450
of those principles.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.330
Right. And then and this is actually

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.330
the connection back to design patterns

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.250
is that you have to discover

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.850
the equivalent of the bridge patterns

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.770
for Agile or should use bridge or adapter

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:30.050
or something else in your particular implementation.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:31.490
And that's not well.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:32.770
Use the teeter totter pattern.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:34.370
The teeter totter.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.930
I'm not familiar with the I just I just made it up,

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.890
but it's in my head.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.570
And once teams start going through the practice,

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.210
then that behavior gets locked in.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.670
And then there's this human aspect around around

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.430
resistant to change.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.270
This is why I think retrospectives

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.790
are important because that's that's an element

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.670
where you encouraging people to be accustomed

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.510
and motivated to change with some goal.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.590
Now, I'm going to get to my questions for you, Al.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.990
When we first met, I think you too were kind of like

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:14.110
a primary a primary piece of your business

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.670
was sort of waterfall to Agile conversions.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.310
Yeah.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.150
Is that what you're doing now?

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.190
Or is it doing or are you doing what I suspect?

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.590
Alan invented a term years ago, which he called fragile.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:30.830
And it stands for effing ridiculous Agile.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.460
But it sounds like you are moving.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:40.380
You are doing more helping people move from fragile to Agile.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.220
Is that is that accurate?

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.620
Well, yeah, it's a piece of it.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.060
So first of all, I had actually for about three hours

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.300
given up on Agile, I was ready to just say,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.820
and go on, except I realized that, well,

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.780
that's not what I'm up to.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.140
What I'm up to is helping people.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.140
And there are all these people suffering, basically,

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.580
at the hands of a lot of consultants

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.260
who are selling frameworks that don't work.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.980
So I realized, no, we need to reclaim Agile.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.900
This is also the map is not the territory.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.420
The Agile manifesto for Agile software development

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.940
is not the territory.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.740
It's the map.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.060
It was a statement of principles,

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.420
a statement of variety things.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.500
The essence of Agile and what I'm trying to help

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.620
organizations do.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.460
I work at the organization level mostly

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.180
to individual training with a discipline Agile

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.740
value stream consultant, which I mostly created.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.380
But I'm really interested in helping organizations

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.940
get better regardless of where they are,

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.260
regardless of how effective they are now,

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.780
whether it's horrible or good.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.180
Mostly the people struggling call me

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.020
because if you're good, they've figured out

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.700
how to improve almost certainly.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.820
But the thing for me is to how do we get people

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.300
to start looking a little more intelligently.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.940
Thinking a bit more critically and be objective oriented

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.500
as opposed to following a practice oriented.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.340
And that's where we are right now.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.580
So when there was something that was said,

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.010
this practice focus I think is what we have

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.890
to get away from.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.690
We have to get what is our intention?

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.570
How do we create value?

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.410
What are the objectives of the practice?

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.930
In other words, if you look at like planning,

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.450
see this is how the patterns tie in.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.450
Think of the planning event.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.210
The planning event is an input in safe.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:22.850
The planning event is a method of doing planning.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.010
But that's a particular solution

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.650
to the pattern called planning.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.290
There are way many implementations of it.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.650
And if we recognize that the objectivist

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.730
is the objectivist to get where people

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:36.690
know what they're doing,

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:40.370
then you don't have to do that full planning event.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:45.410
One of the things that makes safe very difficult is,

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.010
and I think Alan, you mentioned this,

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.090
different people work at different paces.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.530
Different structures are needed.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.130
Not everybody should be in a release train.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.810
If you've got a team of seven people

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.930
working on a new product,

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.650
like with MVPs trying to discover if it's a new product,

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.730
they should not be doing three month planning events.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:03.090
The fact that safe uses MVPs to do three month planning

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.850
just shows you how messed up they are,

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.090
because that's an oxymoron in its own sense.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.850
You cannot do three month event.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.450
The idea is thin slices, but it's not this whole thing.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.490
So we need to get back to what we're trying to do

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.650
and stop trying to follow things.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.730
And I know this is kind of hard for people,

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.250
because people like solutions.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:25.490
People like to lower the risk.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.530
They want a blueprint.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.050
They want a blueprint.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.050
Okay, so you can give them a blueprint.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.610
So I'm not arguing against giving people a blueprint.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.210
What I'm saying is, it's the way you give them the blueprint.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.250
If you say that this is the blueprint now and forever,

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:39.890
and by the way,

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.530
yeah, maybe you want to change it like Scrum does.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.530
Okay, well, don't use Scrum when you get past it.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.930
The Shu Hari BS in my mind.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.690
They say, here's the blueprint, do it a Shu,

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.050
follow this for a while, then you'll learn how to transcend it.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.450
But where in Scrum can you transcend it?

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.930
In fact, if you do transcend it, you call it the Scrum butter.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.370
Oh, there's Scrum butter, you're not doing Scrum,

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:01.890
and it's a negative kind of attitude about it.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:06.530
So what you need to do is have this, as I call it,

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:09.090
the working framework.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.450
You need to give them something to start with,

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:18.290
but you also need to give them a way to show how to improve it

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.410
as time goes on.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.690
This is the decision framework, working framework I did.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.170
Scrum just gives you the working framework,

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.330
and because they don't give you a decision framework,

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.690
and because the decision framework is really two people

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.330
figuring it out themselves, and in my opinion, mostly can,

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:41.360
their cognitive bias is incredibly forced onto the whole Scrum.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.920
I intentionally did not build Flex,

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.980
which is the model that's in the AVSC.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.580
What I have now, I don't even have a name for it,

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.700
because I'm not using Flex.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.580
I've gone beyond that.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.660
But I didn't build that myself.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.220
I had a lot of people give me ideas.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.620
Brad, you gave me one of the ideas, a pattern thing.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.900
I got a dozen other people.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:02.020
Yours happened to be more impactful than most everybody else's.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.100
But yeah, yes, yes, three scores.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.540
But the point is, I would never have gotten to where I was

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.660
if I did it myself.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.980
If I said, oh, this is cool.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.540
I'm smart.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.420
I'm going to do this.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.420
No, I mean, I am smart.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.420
But there are a lot of other smart people,

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.460
and I have found the only way to break your bias

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.370
is either you hit a wall.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:27.570
So yeah, you can't have tragedy that tends to do bias.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.410
But if you don't want to go through life with tragedy

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.650
after tragedy and only learning after tragedy,

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.130
talk to other smart people and listen to them.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.170
And I tend to do that.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:37.250
And that's reflected in my approach.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.890
And I joke.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.490
It was one of my co-creating partners

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:41.650
is a company called Navavi in New Zealand.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.970
And two of the members, there are three guys I work with,

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.970
but Aldo and Hori are there.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.810
And the joke, the running joke is,

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.650
Aldo is supposed to tell me what I left out

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.250
and Hori tells me what I said wrong.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.050
And we joke about it, but I love it.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.010
It's like, oh, I got this self-correcting.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.770
I don't have to try it at a client and mess it up.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.050
They'll tell me before I get out there

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.490
that I'm messing with them.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:02.690
And we don't have that.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.240
We don't have it because we think the solution,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.440
the practices are it.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.440
Like I said, one last thing and I know you want to go.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.760
There's a great quote by Upton Sinclair.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.800
I think it's from the jungle.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.460
It's difficult to get someone to understand something

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.740
when their salary depends on them not understanding it.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:29.520
And this is where Scrum and Safe are killing Agile

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.600
because they've now identified,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.880
I'm a Scrum master.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.160
I'm a CST.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.680
And this is my thing.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.160
Well, man, it's hard to go into a place and not do Scrum

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.840
because you've been called to do it.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.600
Management's mandating it.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.920
People deny that by the way, but I've done some surveys

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.240
and a lot of people are mandating that they do Scrum.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.240
A lot of people are mandating that he's safe.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.280
So you don't have a choice.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.240
You can't get out of it.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.220
And that's causing damage.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.260
That's causing dogma.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.490
So actually, there's a couple of things.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.970
Number one, just very quickly,

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.450
because I actually think,

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.130
what's your view on the Kanban method

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:09.970
in terms of how it addresses the practices framework

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.170
and decision framework?

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.730
Because actually, I'll just say,

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:18.690
like the practice of formally adapting

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.130
the results in changing how you move forward,

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.410
I actually picked up from the Kanban method.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.050
Well, the Kanban method is very useful,

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.050
but it's again an example of the map conflating with the territory.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:36.610
Kanban University.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.810
So I formed, I coformed Lean Kanban University,

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.130
which was a predecessor to Kanban University

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.090
with David Anderson.

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.490
I left some personal reasons,

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.370
some also because I believed in Lean as the driver,

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:50.290
not Kanban as the driver.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.370
There are two kinds of Kanban's out there.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.730
One is the Kanban method.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.810
David has spent a lot of time

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.450
making it sound like he created Kanban, which he didn't.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.410
I was not in the creation, but four other people held.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.410
There's a, you can Google Dan Vekani,

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:04.930
Secret History of Kanban,

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.570
and he tells a very interesting story.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.570
But the Kanban method is a change management approach

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.090
using Kanban, which is brilliant.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:16.690
Kaizen, I've learned a lot from the Kanban method,

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:21.410
but it is not Kanban as a lean approach

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.850
using Kanban and Kaizen,

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.850
where you can also do big changes.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:29.330
So what you find is, in the world when you say Kanban,

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.530
you got to be clear.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.970
Am I talking Kanban method,

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.530
which is a change management system using Kanban,

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:38.050
or is it Kanban, which is a flow system using Kanban,

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.050
and there's nothing that says I can't do big changes.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.050
It's not a change management system.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.010
Personally, I like being armed with both.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.210
This is again Kanban, Kanban method

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.850
are not the territory of getting flow.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.890
They are practices to be able to do it.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:58.270
And this continually conflating the decision framework

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.990
with the working framework is killing us.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.350
Now, here's one last thing on this.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.710
There's another aspect of this.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.110
When I say the map and the territory,

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.540
the territory is what's real,

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.620
except we can't ever get to reality.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.580
So it's like science.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.500
Like physicists, they have models.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.180
They're trying to explain physics.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.700
And we know we don't really understand what's going on.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.540
In fact, the more they get into it with string theory

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.500
and a bunch of other things,

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.460
we learn more and more about there is no reality out there anyway.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.300
That's another metaphysical conversation.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.540
But the point is that aspect of finding reality

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.700
is something we know we're never going to get to.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.980
And we are trying.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.620
And it has nothing to do with your opinion or my opinion.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.540
It has nothing to do with your approach or my approach.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.820
It has to do with what is the working aspect of things.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:47.860
Now, in knowledge work,

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.460
examples of this could be my theory

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.700
that delays and work full of cost waste.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.580
I'm reflecting.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.260
That's my map of the territory.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.300
I think that's reality.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.140
Now, what do I do with that?

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.820
Like these eight or nine things I talked about.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.780
What do I do with that?

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.980
Well, I've come up with a decision framework

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.060
based on my understanding of knowledge work

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.340
to decide what to do.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.620
Now, that's my approach.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.740
It's not the right approach.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.580
It's just Al Shalloway's approach.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.100
You might have a better approach

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.540
and you might brand your approach

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:14.820
and I might brand my approach.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.740
But what we want to be honest about

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.500
is this isn't the territory of how agile works.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.900
It's our approach to trying to figure out

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.700
how to do better.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.340
So when we start thinking about it this way,

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:31.220
we can take the good of scrum or safe.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.900
We can ignore the bad.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.900
We can start learning about how things work

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.100
in the middle of it.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.300
And we have a lot more power

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.540
and we avoid the dogma.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.580
So anyway, there's a quote I'm going to look up.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.620
So I wanted you guys to talk

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.740
and I'll tell you this quote up

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.700
from Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.740
It's just brilliant.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.140
Let me jump on that

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.140
because in your talking there,

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.140
it made me reflect on the way I run stuff.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:00.900
And I came to insight I didn't realize.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.300
And the first thing is I forgot.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.820
Another reason I don't like safe

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.100
and I don't like scrum

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.660
is the whole certification scheme

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.580
around those things I don't believe in.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:14.740
But I wonder if we put to my realization,

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.820
I wonder if it put too much emphasis

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.260
on the map overall.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.020
Because I've realized

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:20.980
while you were talking,

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.420
the map is there,

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.300
but we ignore it.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.180
So let me tell you a little bit

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.460
how my teams work.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.060
I'm talking about planning for three months.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.060
We use a concept on my team

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.060
called the P50 estimate derived

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.180
from Hubbard's work

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.540
on how to estimate anything.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.700
And I found that having a 50% confidence level

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.300
in your date

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.660
for the thing you're going to deliver

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.180
that brings customer value

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.500
is a sweet spot between over planning

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.220
and taking off

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.420
before you know what you're doing.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.620
There's a great quote.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.060
Weeks of coding will save you

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.100
hours of planning.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:52.660
But there's a...

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:57.730
But there's that P50 is that sweet spot

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.770
and we end up zeroing in on that over time.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:04.370
Also then I do not hire project managers

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.490
or scrum masters or any of that.

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.010
My engineering leads,

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:10.690
every people manager on the team

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.410
is responsible for the delivery of their team

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:15.410
and for P50 estimates for their team.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:16.610
And we have a safe environment,

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:17.410
lowercase safe,

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.690
meaning psychological safety

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.970
where it's okay to miss dates.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.130
They're accountable for delivery.

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:26.290
I don't care what methodology they use.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:27.570
I don't give them a map.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.730
They can choose,

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.810
they can go try and use a variation of scrum.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:32.850
They can use textbook scrum.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:33.810
They can use Kanban.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.130
They can use something they make up.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.730
They can use little mini waterfall,

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.410
whatever, as long as they get,

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:40.770
long as they are predictable

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:42.530
and they're bringing value to customers.

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:46.370
And then when we have something complicated,

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:47.970
when there's something that spans

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.010
multiple teams,

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.250
I use program managers.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:52.850
We have a small number of those who,

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:53.570
that's their job.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:57.010
They take the complex hairy things

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:58.930
and make sure they're not complex and hairy.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:48:59.490
In a way,

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:02.530
my view on that based on this conversation is

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:06.450
I am for some reason trying to avoid the map

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.450
because maybe to me I've realized

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:09.730
the map doesn't matter as much.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:11.970
Well, the territory is more important than the map,

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:13.010
but you've got to get

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.170
that not everybody thinks the way you do, Alan.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:17.650
So you can hold it in your head

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.650
and you're working with a group of teams

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:20.530
and you're present,

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:22.050
but see what I'm trying to do

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:22.770
is something different.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.370
So I'm not disputing what you're doing.

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.690
I'm not saying what you're doing is not effective,

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:27.650
but there's a difference

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:29.810
when you're internally consulted

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:31.010
and always present

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.530
and you could course correct.

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.130
But a lot of people like,

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:35.490
give me an answer,

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.090
give me a way to do something

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.970
and they will only pay attention to a map.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.470
Yeah, granted it does take a while

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.150
to build up an organization.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.470
So if what you do,

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.510
so I can deliver like that.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.150
That's what I do,

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:50.430
because I'm in a situation

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:51.550
where I try to go in

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:52.990
and I'm trying to get people

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.670
who aren't used to thinking this way.

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:55.870
And I'm not trying to get them

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:56.830
to think the way I think,

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.190
because first of all,

00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.390
that can get you into trouble

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.470
for a lot of reasons.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:03.230
But I mean,

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:04.590
I have a certain style of thinking

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.030
and it applies in a lot of places

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.230
and it doesn't apply

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.190
in a lot of places.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.310
So I mean,

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.350
if everybody felt like me,

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:12.670
the world would not be in a better place

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:14.430
in terms of solving technical problems.

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:18.750
But so what we want to do

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.510
is recognize the people we talk to

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.510
who are needing to hold on to things.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.190
Well, we just need to make

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:25.790
them clear about is the answer

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:27.070
we're giving them is what we know

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:28.990
at the moment is the best way to do things.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:31.870
And examples are like driving.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:33.390
What side of the road do you drive on?

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.430
Well, in the United States,

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:35.470
on the right side of the road,

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:36.590
isn't even 100%.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.150
You go into places

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.750
where there are one lane roads.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:42.190
I mean, not one way,

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.310
one way roads.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:44.430
You don't always want to be

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.030
on the right side of the road.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.230
So we have to remember

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.510
what's the objective

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.630
and what is the implementation

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:52.430
of the objective.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:53.310
And that's a pattern, right?

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:54.110
What's the objective?

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:55.070
How do I implement it?

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.590
Different ways to solve it.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:58.510
And what I hate about scrum so much

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.830
is they are a self-assumbing

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:01.630
that you don't have to

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:02.670
state the objective here.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:03.310
Just do this.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:03.870
It's simple.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:04.590
Use it as is.

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:05.790
And if you don't, it's your fault.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.180
But when you have the objective

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.300
and you have a theory,

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.490
then people can learn how.

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:12.530
What's a better way

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:13.810
to solve my problem?

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.900
So what you want to do

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.220
is recognize I have this working set

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.660
of heuristics, I suppose,

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.540
or practices

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.660
or whatever you want to call them.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.980
And then I need to teach people

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.100
that, hey, well, it's fine.

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.460
But when it breaks,

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.980
don't assume you're at fault.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.340
Maybe it's the practice.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.500
And how do you do an improvement

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.060
to the system?

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.820
How do you do double loop learning?

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.740
Double loop learning is like,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.460
like, you know,

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.340
a single loop learning

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.380
is like a thermostat.

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:41.500
You want to keep the temperature

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.100
between, say, 70 and 74.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.900
If you go above it,

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.780
it puts AC on.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.060
You go below it, puts heating on.

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:47.740
But double loop learning

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:48.380
as well as that,

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.580
even the right way to do it.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.740
Should I be following this practice?

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.820
And maybe there's a better way to do this.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.820
Maybe the thermostat changes

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.980
when I leave the house.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.620
If I, you know,

00:51:58.620 --> 00:51:59.740
the Google Nest does that.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.180
Maybe I have a controller on my wall

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.860
or I have it on my phone.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.220
What's interesting is safe and scrum

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.900
don't have double loop learning

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.340
on the frameworks themselves.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.260
In other words, they're saying

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.100
this is God's answer to your problem.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.200
That's damaging.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.160
That's dogma.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.440
Oh, here's the quote, by the way.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.040
This is from Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.430
The difference between science and religion

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.770
is religion can't abide being wrong.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.210
Science seeks to be wrong.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.610
So here's my corollary to that

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:33.650
in the Agile space.

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:35.970
The difference between science

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.650
and the way Agile is practiced

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:40.370
is Agile is practiced

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:41.730
can't abide being wrong.

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:42.930
Science seeks to be wrong.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.250
And I was by that, I mean,

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.890
I remember once on a public forum,

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.690
some I was saying something around scrum

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:51.570
and somebody said,

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:52.690
well, how would you feel like

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:54.690
if your method was challenged?

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:56.370
And I think I think I really spawned

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:57.570
that was a surprise.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:58.930
The guy said, oh, I would love it.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:52:59.890
I want to know what's wrong

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:01.250
with my approach so I can fix it

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:03.650
because I'm trying to find out what works.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:04.930
I'm not trying to defend

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:05.970
an approach I'm creating.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.880
What are the rules of knowledge work?

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.640
I have nothing to say about.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.760
You have nothing to say about.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.640
It's just the way it is.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.230
That is something I want to learn.

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:17.470
And then that's more of us,

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:18.910
all of us talking in a forum

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:20.590
to learn that then what's my brand?

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:21.390
Okay, I've got this thing

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:22.830
I call Amplioza team.

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.590
Amplioza is Latin for improvement

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:25.390
and the discipline

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:26.590
Agilivis stream consultant

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.630
I did through the PMI.

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.740
What's wrong about those approaches?

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:31.700
Well, I want to know

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.940
so I can improve the approach I take.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.860
What's wrong about my understanding

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.820
of how things work?

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.020
Well, I want to understand

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:38.740
how things work

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.740
because then I could improve them.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.180
And there's very little,

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.100
attempt at learning that last part.

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:46.100
I get attacked for that a lot

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.780
when I point out that

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.220
a lot of the way things are designed

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.980
ignores the reality of the world.

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.440
Which is okay, actually,

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.480
because I get enough people

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.760
who are learning from the attacks.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.640
I'm starting to actually

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.760
make another side comment.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.240
There's a book I highly recommend

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.600
to anybody who's frustrated

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.640
with the way things are.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.560
It's called The Obstacle

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.320
is the Way by Ryan Holiday.

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.680
He writes about stoicism.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.000
He's also written the ego is the enemy

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.760
and the stowaway and stuff like that.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.200
And I've read a couple of his books,

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.560
but the obstacle is the way.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.030
Says what's in your way

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.990
is the way through it.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.590
And it's not this thing,

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.270
this Pollyanna of what doesn't kill

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:23.470
us makes us stronger

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:25.070
or we got to overcome obstacles

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:26.510
because then they give opportunities.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:27.630
He's really saying the key

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.740
is looking at the problem.

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.100
And I apply this all the time.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.460
My productivity has gone up.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.660
My innovation has gone up

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:34.940
like an order magnitude

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.740
since I read this book.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.020
And I'll give you one quick example.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.700
So I said I was ready

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.620
to just chuck it with agile.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.220
And then I thought, no, no.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.660
First of all, two things are going to happen.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.260
One, I'm leaving behind a lot of people

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.540
who are having troubles.

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.340
Second of all, they're going to

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.540
catch up to me anyway.

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.700
I mean, things I said 10 years ago,

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.300
15 years ago, people are now

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.660
have saying it, but they're saying it wrong.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.020
You know, like scrum is based on length.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:55.980
Well, I never said scrum

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.780
was based on length.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.180
But 14 years ago, I said scrum

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:00.540
can be thought of as a

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.700
partial implementation only now scrum

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.340
and I was thrown off

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.460
the scrum development group

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.740
for saying that Jeff

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.940
and Ken denied it was true.

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.170
And now they're saying scrum is linked,

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:11.970
which isn't.

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:13.570
You can't run away from

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:15.250
bastardization of concepts.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.530
People are just going to follow you

00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.050
and do that.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:18.930
So I thought about it.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.850
Okay, agile, if the answer is

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.690
the obstacles, the way why is it

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:24.130
people are abusing agile

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:25.330
and turning it into fragile?

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.210
Why is it that safe gets abused?

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:29.890
Why is it that scrum gets abused

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:31.570
and look at that reason

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.450
and use that as how to improve things.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.370
And like I said, I was three hours

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:37.730
of despondent then I said,

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:38.690
okay, I'll get off that

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:39.650
and stop complaining.

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:41.790
And now I'm really thinking about that.

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:42.590
That's what I'm talking about.

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:43.630
Reclaiming agile,

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.870
that the way to reclaim agile

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:47.870
is to look at what did agile really mean.

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:49.470
And there's this aspect of learning

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:51.870
what truly is the territory.

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:53.950
And then how do we get that back?

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.870
And Alan, I know you think about this.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:57.470
I can tell from how you're talking

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:58.510
and I know Brent does.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:59.550
I've known him for a long time.

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:00.670
I haven't met you.

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:01.550
I just met you now.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:03.950
But what's interesting is

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:05.790
when you listen to how people talk

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:08.110
and you ask yourself

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:11.310
where are they coming from

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.190
and saying what they're saying.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.460
See, if somebody says,

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.900
well, you're not following scrum

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.100
or somebody says, well,

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.980
something simple just use it as is.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.500
That's a big statement right there.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.620
Oh, you should be following.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.860
You should be believing something

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.460
instead of how do you think for yourself?

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:32.780
And I think what I'm trying to do now

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.940
is create a forum in a sense

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:37.260
to be a catalyst for people like ourselves

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.180
to see how to move this forward.

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.460
I'm not interested in some people

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:40.940
that ask me,

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.300
oh, am I going to do some of the stuff

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.380
I did before like Lean Systems Society?

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.580
I've had two or three things,

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.140
True North Society, different thing.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.740
And the answer is no, I'm not.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.020
Because I've never found

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.300
the business model for that

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.900
and it always peters out after all.

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.110
Well, what I am trying to do

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.190
is kind of maybe be a beacon

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:02.350
for others and create exposure.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:02.830
In other words,

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.470
I'm not competing with folks like yourself.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:07.550
I'm like, hey, let's light more candles.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.910
And go after those people

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.910
who want to see what are better ways

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.110
without the dogman box.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.480
Yeah, I think that's probably

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.680
a good thing to end on.

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.120
I will say that

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.160
Oh, this is awesome.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.440
And thank you for coming to us

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.800
in a fantastic conversation.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.200
I got to run, but Al,

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.280
it's been a huge pleasure having you here.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:27.760
Thank you.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.600
Britt, you know,

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.240
I understand.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:30.640
You're all right.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.120
Yeah, good job.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.040
Because I said like three words this time.

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.520
Al, thank you very much.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.520
And as just as a closure,

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.000
I don't know.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.360
So Al is if anyone wants to reach out to you,

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.120
what's how can they do it?

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:45.570
The easiest way is my email.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:47.090
Al dot shallow way.

00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:50.450
S H A L L O W A Y at success

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:52.530
engineering dot works.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:54.530
W O R K S success engineering.

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:55.010
Just two words.

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:57.250
No, I'll attempt with that.

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:58.770
But for me on LinkedIn,

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:00.370
I think I'm the only Alan shell.

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:01.970
Al shallow way on LinkedIn

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:03.090
and connect with me.

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:03.890
Please connect with me.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:05.410
I got my contact information there.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.450
That'll work.

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:09.650
