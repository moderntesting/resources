00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
to have the same mindset that you need to be a tester because a software engineer

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.560
has to have that same what could go wrong. I've carried a pager for 20 years. I guarantee you,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.320
I can think like a tester. There's nothing that gives you a quality mindset like not having to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.850
wake up at three o'clock in the morning. Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.490
podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.170
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now, on with the show. Hey everybody,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.410
welcome back to the AVE Testing Podcast. Happy new year. I am here. I'm Alan. We have Brent.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.810
Hello.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.530
This is I.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.770
Hello.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.730
We also have Brian Finster. Brian, say hi.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.170
Hi, I'm Brian.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.290
I am excited to have you here for a bunch of reasons that will emerge. What I want to do

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.730
first is give a little context on why Brian's here. This is both for our listeners who may not

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.050
have seen. We talk about you on our Slack. If you want to go to join our Slack group,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.690
you can go to moderntesting.org, click on the link, join right away. We've talked a little

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.090
bit about some of your LinkedIn posts. Good stuff. We're not talking dirty behind your back or

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.810
anything. But I imagine Brian being much more of an internet celebrity than Brent and our three

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.250
listeners. There's people coming to listen to our podcast going, why is Brian hanging out with these

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.570
two half-baked people trying to make a podcast for eight years?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.610
Dude, I'm seriously half-baked. I don't understand.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.010
Yeah, okay. Between all of us, we are one and a half-baked.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.850
And this is also a context for you, Brian, to know why did these guys invite me here?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.170
So once upon a time, about eight years ago, Brent and I were both in testing roles at Microsoft.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.410
I led a few cross-company test-related groups, and Brent and I had such a good rapport in there.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.050
And we've been giving each other crap like this now going on 10 years that someone,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.770
I think it was Michael Hunter said, you can start a podcast. What was that, Brent?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.970
It's been longer than 10 years. I met you when I joined the TLT, right? So it's been longer than

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.450
that. That was the test leadership team at Microsoft. And I'm going to assume it's the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.130
same for all of you. I have now lost my ability to track how many years have gone by.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.090
There was a blurry few years in there that are still blurry. But anyway, we started a podcast.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.290
And we're going to figure this out as we go. And we talked about doing a podcast. But

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.570
one thing happened very early on as we very early on, the conversation shifted to something

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.970
prominent. And it was that Brent and I were both seeing that software delivery was changing.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.450
It was changing definitely before then, but Microsoft is usually the last to know about

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.050
changes and how software is made. Dude, I came from Walmart, so.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.570
There is the clip that goes on the beginning. Dude, I came from Walmart.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.090
So we saw this world where fast feedback loops wouldn't need armies of testers because they would

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.850
get in the way. And we could reach higher quality by focusing on feedback loops, data,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.090
and adaptability. So we talked about that because we were seeing it. We weren't trying to invent

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.250
anything. We were talking about what we were seeing. So we talked about that on the podcast

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.330
with the goal of helping testers navigate these changes that were going on because things are

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.290
changing. Things are still changing in some ways. Things are still the same. They're a

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.610
little bit different. Fast forward a bit. We came up with these modern testing principles,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.130
which were the idea was to try and like, what are the principles behind what we've been

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.410
talking about for a few years now? And they're not modern and they're not about testing,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:55.650
but we wrote them as sort of the, not the antidote, but the growth, like the traditional

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.130
test as a gatekeeper type of testing to modern testing where things are different.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.170
They're really modern delivery, but we're keeping them. We still call them the modern testing

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:13.170
principles. We, if I may interject, we call them that mostly because to resonate with the audience,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.810
we were trying to target. We saw two movements. It's super important. I mean, you have to do that.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
In Alan's story, all of that is true. One of the things though,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.570
that at least I experienced. So I spent a good amount of my career in middle management in QA.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.890
And Alan very similarly, while he was at Microsoft, he avoided management, but

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.570
he still had very high scoped roles with large reach, large impact. And so when we both started

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.890
talking while he was still at Microsoft, and this was before Microsoft did his big switch,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.610
when to sort of dramatically reduce the number of testers, we both had at that point in time

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:11.410
experienced around, Oh, this is what happens. This is why this works. Because back then Agile was,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.820
was like crazy sauce, right? They're like, what do things without a hundred page document?

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.860
That's crazy. Alan and I were not only, not only did we see that it was coming,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.440
but at that point in time, we were one of the few that wholeheartedly defended that that is the way

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.400
we should be going. Which I don't know about Alan, he's far more charismatic than I am, but it

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:51.680
did cause some sacrifice to some friendships on that front. What? You're deserting. How can you?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:02.000
The creator. Exactly. And based on, based on LinkedIn comments, I'm guessing Brian, that that is a

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.800
phenomenon you're familiar with. I did give Brent some pre reading to kind of get familiar with it.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.960
So this is interesting because I really want to talk to about the history about how I came

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.760
came to this. Yeah. Because I've been a software developer doing product development since 1996.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.310
I've been doing it for awhile. Honestly, did it the way that I know a lot of people still do it,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.710
which is I code something and then I go and manually test it and I go deploy it and hope

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.980
it doesn't blow up for years and years and years. You know, if you, and this before I,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.900
before I worked at Walmart, but you know, Walmart, we went through a whole bunch of Agile

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.180
transformations as one does, which right after they sent us to PMI training, by the way,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.220
which was really interesting. You know, I, I was one test away from being a project manager,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:58.540
like fully certified by PMI. But we got to the point where we'd stabilized. I worked in

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.780
logistics at the time and I was working in warehouse management systems. And, you know,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.270
the primary system I worked on was, I mean, oh my God, it made windows look small. I'm pretty sure.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.590
I mean, it's, it's just a nightmare of old, it was like four different warehouse management

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:21.150
systems all banged together with a common database that we'd applied after this modernization effort.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.900
But we were delivering that thing almost four times a year. Now this is also a period of time

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.540
when Walmart was going through a lot of acquisitions. So we're getting a lot of other markets,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.380
you know, South Africa and Central America and all these, all these different markets.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:46.480
And, you know, we need them to be on a common logistics system. We don't want to be integrating

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.640
all their legacy logistics systems. And, you know, we're delivering change every

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.820
three to four times a year. We did a value stream map one time and it was,

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.800
took us 12 months from a business request to deliver it to production. Right. I mean,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.760
it was a nightmare. And every single time we did a deploy, so at the time, so I'm talking

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.720
about when we're just at the cusp of doing things correctly, they put me in charge of the team

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.160
responsible for integrating all of the feature branches every quarter for the quarterly release.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.240
Right. I talked to, it sounds like a fun job. It was a fun job. Now they, it was very entertaining.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.040
They, they gave me this job because I've been really looking into how other organizations

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.080
were doing source management. And I thought we could do it better. And they gave me the

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.150
mandate of making the team obsolete, making the team go away. Right. So it was an improvement

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.510
effort. And I was like, I'm all over that. I don't want to sit here. Let's make things better.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.710
And I talked to Gene Kim about this after when he, he said we had drafted unicorn project and

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.270
he was talking about merge day for the Phoenix project. It was like 350 branches. I was like,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:03.570
that's nothing. Hold my beer. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:15.380
Brian, are you the real Brent? No, no, I'm not. But I am the sad that had to integrate 400 branches

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:22.340
every quarter, you know? And so you integrate 400 plus branches every quarter. And, you know,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.780
then you deal with the merge conflicts and then you're six weeks late and then you go and deploy

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.820
and you've got scheduled war rooms for like scheduled here's the schedule for the next

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.940
week. Who's going to be working which part of the 24 hours seven day a week shift to support and

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.780
stabilize the system after this delivery for just the initial part of the stabilization. Okay.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.240
So I mean, I did it's just a nightmare. And it was just normal, right? I mean,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.160
it's not a nightmare because that's just how you work. And then SVP said, Hey, look,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.910
we need to do this every two weeks because we can't meet our business goals by delivering

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:08.370
this slowly. And so what do they do? Of course, what they did was they hired McKinsey and Bain

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.650
and brought in no, no, no, no, no, actually, Randy, Randy, the SVP at the time, Randy Salley,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.010
love that guy still have beer with him. Randy presented this as an engineering problem to us

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:25.260
senior engineers in logistics and said, Hey, I need you to fix this. Right? So one of my

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.410
teammates got a copy of continuous delivery. We read it. We knew about Conway's law.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:40.980
We I read like the domain driven design for dummies. And we put together a plan for leadership

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:49.090
about how we can go to more frequent delivery. And in fact, when Patrick and I were working through

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:55.120
this, we had a, there was project manager assigned to this project. And Patrick and I said, okay,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.440
look, we think there were two weeks isn't aggressive enough. We need to go for daily.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.880
If we go for daily, we might go for weekly. If we go for over two weeks, we might be hit every month.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.600
So let's go for daily. And the project manager said, well, they asked for over two weeks. We

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.640
don't care. We're going for daily. So will I quit? If you guys are going to do that,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.680
like we don't need you because we're doing this for two decades. We're fine on our own things.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:24.220
And we drove for daily, but just so, but imagine the situation we're in. We are a bunch

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:30.700
of developers who we have a QA area. Who's been doing all the testing for us, mostly manual.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:37.540
None of the developers in the area actually know how to test at all. Okay. We're not going to go

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.820
for daily production delivery. So today's code goes to production today. That was our goal.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.040
Now we had an ops area too, because they'd gone through the whole matrix organization fat and

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:55.440
split off support from product from development where we used to run what we brung. They pulled

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:04.290
that away for developer productivity, which just destroyed quality even further. But they, the ops

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:11.090
SLA was that you had to be stable for 90 days before they'd take it over, but we're delivering

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.210
every single day. So we'll never get it to them. So that means we're going to get ops back,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.790
which made me incredibly happy. Honestly, I wanted ops back, but that also means we're going to be

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:25.810
delivering untested code every single day to production. None of the work. So we have to

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:32.450
dig into testing. And so I started taking testing very, very seriously. And I started working

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.050
through this problem, just going backwards from I need to deploy every single day.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.940
It has to be validated that it's ready for production every single day. The way all this

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.540
testing is being done right now will not work. So we have to reinvent all of testing.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:53.840
I had to get the QA lead that was assigned to us on board. We had to, as the pilot teams,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:00.300
learn how to test from scratch. I've got a copy of XUnit test patterns. It was like 900 pages

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.540
long. I was pouring through that. I was pouring through everything I can find. I was interviewing

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.900
developers about why they were struggling with testing. It was like, Oh, well, because the

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:16.140
requirements are crap. So I discovered, I found the behavior driven development. We learned to do

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:22.400
that. So we could get clean requirements so that we would know what to test. And we were doing

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.280
all this upfront work so that we can write testing code, do real continuous integration,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:36.110
and push testing code to production. And so what my takeaway from this journey was the continuous

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:44.180
delivery is a quality initiative that it stress-tested your quality process and that you must

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:53.150
focus on quality if you're going to be good at this. Later on, I went to the lady who used to be

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:59.150
my senior director. She moved to be the senior director of QE because I rebranded QA to QE and

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:04.910
told her she needed to hire me to drive CD across the organization because CD was a quality

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:14.000
initiative, not a development initiative. And every since then, test architecture,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:23.970
how do I get from idea to production with fewer handoffs, fewer, less reworked,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:31.250
faster feedback at every single step. There was a, early on in this process, QA put on this

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:38.160
whole quality conference. And I was one of the keynote speakers, not in QA, talking about how

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.240
testing, you test everything. You test meetings. You don't go to a meeting list. You have an agenda

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.590
that you can assert against. That's an interesting angle.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.750
It's like if you don't have an agenda for a meeting, don't show up because you have nothing

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.430
to assert against to find out if you got value from the meeting. I said we're testing for value,

00:14:54.430 --> 00:15:00.990
not for adherence to spec. Yes. So much yes.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:09.630
And people say, well, how do you test the test? You ship it. The test is just prod.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:16.110
You don't. That's how you test the test. You don't. I love that phrase. I'm writing it down.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:23.730
You test for value. I wrote a blog post recently called the three wrongs. And this is something

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:30.770
I, you know, just like an epiphany I had several years ago that the whole, the reason for all this

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:36.770
agile nonsense is everything is wrong all the time. The problem with classic testing process where you

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.970
have product owner or BA or somebody creating requirements, handing them to the development

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.970
team and then handing them to a testing team to automate the tests or do manual testing

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.530
is that it's missing the foundational principle that the requirements probably wrong in the

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.330
first place. And on top of that, we're going to misunderstand them because of the handoff.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.690
And then when you hand them to a development team and a testing team, you double the chance

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:04.690
misunderstanding. And I've measured this in real life on development teams with value stream maps

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:10.350
and interviews when we were, when I was running the dojo. I've seen this in reality where the

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:16.000
testing team misunderstood the requirements differently from the product team. And they

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.800
both misunderstood the requirements for what the product owner meant. And the product owner

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.820
actually misunderstood the need. And I have documented that in value stream maps.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.380
I think it's Crosby. I think it's Crosby. Now I'm taking this myself who said,

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:37.810
quality is conformance to requirements. And I've modified that before you cringe and go,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:45.170
I believe it. It's true. Quality is conformance to requirements, but only the customer can define

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:53.490
requirements. I gave it there was a talk. Oh, even further, the customers, customer themselves

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.290
may not actually know the requirements. No, they don't until they see it and then they can edit it.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:05.810
Yeah. Right. Right. But the, there's a talk I used to give. So the last role I held at Walmart

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:11.330
was I led the DevOps Studio at Walmart. And our job was to, we were using continuous delivery

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:18.050
as a forcing function or to improve engineering excellence and business delivery across the

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:23.520
organization. We were building a platform that was optimized for that. If you weren't using a CD

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:30.480
workflow, the platform was hard. It fought you on purpose. Like we need Gitflow. Yeah. No,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:38.340
we're Gitflows on our roadmap. And I was asked to create a dojo where you use immersive learning

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:44.980
to help teams learn continuous delivery. We're like hands on, we join your team as engineers,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:51.220
not freaking agile coaches, and pair with you while you learn CD in your context with your work.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:57.330
And I used to give these talks about testing and one of the talks I gave about testing,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:05.250
I always started off with this definition of quality. And I had an image of the 2017 MacBook

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:11.570
Pro. Now do you guys remember the 2017 MacBook Pro? Oh, that's the one with the touch bar. They

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:18.700
added the touch bar. They removed the escape key. They removed MagSafe charging. They removed all

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:25.180
the ports and just use USB C. It was the highest quality piece of crap you could buy. And I had

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.420
a picture of this and I was talking about how I'm a photographer. They took away my SD card

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:35.900
reader. So now I have to go down over SD card reader. I have dogs, large dogs. So they run past

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.580
the coffee table, trip on the cord, right? When they ripped the computer off the coffee table

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.820
instead of just some MagSafe cable detaching. I'm a software developer who focuses on Unix.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:56.050
I need my escape key. How am I going to get out of VI? And I'm like, when that computer came out,

00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:01.730
I bought a refurbished of my personal machine. I needed a new one. I bought a refurbished 2016

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:06.610
instead of a new 2017 because it was garbage. And then I was starting to say, this is what

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:12.210
quality means. Quality means it meets the user's need. Not that it meets the spec.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:22.270
I have a whole other thing about why I don't do that. But this is the core fundamental thing

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:29.420
is that everything we do is wrong until we can get it to the front of the end user

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:37.260
and find out what's wrong so that we can adjust. And that the reason I focus so hard on continuous

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:44.140
delivery is because of the joy that we felt when we were able to deliver multiple times a day

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:51.820
to the end user, get feedback directly from that end user, adjust, give them feedback the next day,

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:58.780
they were happy. We were happy. Morale was high. Quality was high. Everybody should work that way,

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.100
but it requires rethinking all the things that you think you know are true.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:09.970
Yeah. A million percent. Yes. Every once in a while I joined a new team and somebody doesn't

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:15.410
get it. And I remember at my last company, I joined the new team or talking about delivery.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:24.290
I said I would rather ship 10 times a day than once a week. And the SVP just, I don't get why

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:31.170
you would say that. It's fine. It's fine. We're not going to go into it. But I convinced him.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:36.610
It took me a few years, but he was on board. It's just a different way of thinking.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:43.010
Well, you get terrified of size, right? Once you do it, you get terrified. It's like,

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.570
what do you mean 500 lines of code? Are you kidding me?

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:51.330
No. Well, so part of it is like in the transformation. And I think you're right.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:59.230
Right. In my own journey on shifting to agile, like for me,

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:06.590
I've told this multiple times on the podcast, but I'll do it. I'll do the short version for Brian.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.430
Everyone else can press the skip 30 seconds.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:20.030
I went to Scrum. We executed it poorly. A two week Scrum ended up taking three months for us to

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:29.390
unscrew up. And then we shifted to a Kanban model where basically a small little thing ships

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:37.390
independently. And in order to execute that, you had to make certain changes. You had to make smaller

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:44.880
changes. You had to cover the entire test suite, as you called out just a second ago.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:53.040
But where the magic went in is one day, one of my people submitted something and everything was on

00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:00.660
the floor. Now that sounds like a bad story. However, because it was just one change that went

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:06.340
in that put everything on the floor, it took seconds for us to back it out, took seconds for

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:16.660
us to repair it. The guy knew instantly what he did wrong and get it out. I had to multiple times

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.140
go forward and try to do the same conversations you did. And that Alan just talked about

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:28.820
convincing others to take the risk on my team, we're going to execute this way. And to your

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.500
point, this is the point I resonate with. When they think, oh, we're going to ship once a week,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.780
they have the size in their head. And then when we say we're going to do it 10 times a day,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.780
they don't automatically shift that size in their head. How are you going to do that 10 times a day?

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.620
Well, it's actually we're not we're shifting to small batch.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:56.620
Yeah, it takes a lot of practice. And I've been having the last couple of days, I've been having

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.660
some really intense discussions with people who are trying to redefine continuous integration,

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:09.870
so they can feel better about not doing it. And but here's the thing, okay, is that that

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.670
driving down that batch size is not the goal, it's the forcing function to the goal.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:24.510
Yes. Okay. And I'll give you another example that you reminded me of is that of something saving

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:33.230
our ass, because we took CD seriously. Okay, I had the when we've been going on for a while,

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.790
and one of the other teams have been focusing on working this way. And I had a direct dependency on

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:42.430
them. They were the they were my downstream service that I needed a lot of information from.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.550
I worked very closely with the tech lead. We were doing contract driven development.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.400
Anytime we needed a contract, anytime we needed to change between the two of us,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.600
we were coordinating through our contracts, we can deploy independently, because that was the

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:01.360
other thing we put rules in place when we started this, every team delivers in any sequence,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.160
asynchronously from anybody else, which meant we had to focus on really good API management.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:13.630
Well, there was a test that we had to run, where we would, and this is logistics, we get a

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:22.030
purchase order come in, it would process through their system. And then we would do something

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:28.350
to validate that we were actually could receive freight, and create inventory. And that was the

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:38.960
test took four hours to run that test. I can't do CD that way. And so it's Walmart. We didn't

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.720
have a lot of external information, all works very inwardly facing, we independently invented

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:55.070
virtual services. We submitted a pull request to my colleague's team, to give them a contract mock

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:02.370
of their API. And then created a process where we would send a test, a test header.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.060
And they would get they would serve the mock instead of actually hitting their actual

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:14.080
logic. And so now this integration test between the two teams went from four hours to microseconds.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:24.240
So the way but but Brian, you're testing the mock. Yep. We also get contract tests to test the mock

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.440
against the actual response so that we can validate the mock. Anytime you're doing a contract test.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.540
So when you're doing integration tests with mocks, you also have to have a contract test to validate

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:42.620
the mock. Sure. Right. So we did both. Okay. But the result of that, though, is that they

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.500
made it when we were going live in the distribution center, and they had us in a distribution center

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.220
with really terrible network latency and all sorts of other problems. Because of course they did.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:59.420
We're we're going live. And we're making changes rapidly as because there's always the things that

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.150
you didn't know about until you actually try to use the system for real. They broke their contract.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.440
And we discovered it instantly when we ran our test the next time before anything deployed.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:21.280
And before anything could have broken anything in production. Because they're just just that broke

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:30.000
the test immediately. Right. But the only reason that that test existed that way is because you

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.320
can't do CD with the way we were doing integration testing before. Right. Right. It's the driving

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:44.080
down to focusing on speed of feedback. Driving down that batch size forces you to solve these problems.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:51.500
And it makes you safer. It removes drama. It makes the work suck less.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:27:02.110
You know, this is something that I've started to do with my junior. So years ago,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:12.190
I shifted away from QA, went to dev. And now, and then little after that, I became a data scientist.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:18.030
And now I actually run a sort of a dev team that's producing data science driven services.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:32.420
One of the things that that energizes your ICs is closing the loop between the customer value

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:41.540
proposition and their actual work. Oh, dude, dude. So I gave a talk with my teammate in

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:48.000
2017 at DevOps Enterprise Summit. Because I'd gone to the conference the first time in 2015.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.640
And I saw all these executives talking about all these things we're doing and how it impacts the

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.560
enterprise. Like bullshit. How's an enterprise? We need to tell everybody how it impacts the teams.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:02.020
And we had a slide that talked about how it made us love developing it.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.550
We were beating animated heart on the slide. And it just made us love development again because of

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:15.890
that. Because we got to see our work being used instantly. We got feedback. I talked to somebody

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:21.680
at the conference that year who was a platform developer for Exxon. And he said, it seems like

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.860
all the best developers get a platform because it can be closer to the customer. And I just moved

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.100
to Walmart platform and the people I worked with, I was like, oh yeah, I agree.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.700
That makes sense. People are motivated by progress.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.980
And Dan, you've gotten there. But one thing, if I can, I'm going to change just,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:52.580
not even a change of gear, a little bit of a veer here. Your journey on discovering testing,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:29:00.100
I think is pretty unique. But maybe not. I don't know. I see the pockets, everything we're talking

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.540
about, things we're seeing happen all over the place. But there's still a lot of people

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:10.740
doing the old way. When I spent a chunk of my career teaching developers how to test and having

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.460
very good luck with it and realizing that developers actually could be very good testers.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:21.940
And I tried to accelerate that via, sometimes on one project, I did a lot of it just by doing a

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:28.930
whole lot of code reviews. And what I found is, one, developers can be very good testers.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:36.110
And two, not surprisingly, when developers knew testing was part of what they were delivering,

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.670
they began to design better code in the first place because they started to think about testability

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:45.390
as they were creating the code. And they go, well, I'm going to test this. They would think

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:53.070
ahead. You discovered a lot of devs without, may not think of that contract testing solution.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:58.190
Well, that's amazing how they didn't know this exists. So there's a curiosity. I'm curious,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:05.950
one question is, how did you discover some of the nuance? And then the other end of that,

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.230
I know you've written on LinkedIn a little bit about this before. I want to talk about it a

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:13.470
little bit. But there's this whole developers can't test thing, which we know is bullshit.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:19.470
And I'm just curious on why you think people think that as well. So first question,

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:25.390
how did you get so good at testing without a great coach like me? And two,

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:34.270
Brent, I'm muting himself just to laugh. And then two, what do you think it'll take to get

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.550
more people to figure out that devs can actually do really good testing?

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:48.780
So, you know, I found mentors. Liz Keo has no idea who I am. Okay, I have talked to her on

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:56.660
Twitter occasionally. If I ever meet her, she gets so much beer or whiskey or whatever her favorite

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:03.060
drink is, because she was my behavior driven development mentor. I consumed everything that

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:08.900
she had to say about that. I went out and found people. I'm spanking on the name, the guy who

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:18.300
wrote cucumber and cheese. I was finding these resources out there. I found the Xunip

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:26.220
webpage and I was pulling from that. It was my job to discover how we can do this. And then

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:32.300
to spread that knowledge, because we had to solve the problem of continuous delivery. Patrick,

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.580
my colleague, he was working on the automation. I was working on how to use the automation.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:48.500
And so that was, I had to, it was my eval. And then also binding other people,

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:55.180
if you don't know how to test, we can't do CD. I needed everybody to do CD. Even before we,

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:03.500
this is why, even before we started using continuous delivery as an enterprise

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:10.780
improvement strategy, I knew that if we didn't spread the disease of continuous delivery to

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.500
other areas, it would be easy to kill. All we'd do is take one leadership change at a low level,

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.140
CD's dead, and we'd go back to the old terrible way of delivering the software. I didn't want that.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.900
And so I was going out to the end. So if you understand at the time, I didn't talk to people.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:32.610
I was, I'm an introvert, but I was an actively not talking to people introvert.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:43.420
But I needed this to happen for my quality of life. Right. And so I was going out to other teams

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.100
and explaining to what we're doing in behavior driven development. It's the, I was giving

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.020
presentations about it. Just, Hey, you want to have a, what's your team to have a presentation

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.740
with BDD. I was finding other people who were coming in from other organizations and who had

00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:00.620
a test collaborating with them. Hey, let's, how do we do this better? Later on, when I moved to

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:07.900
platform, we hired Villa Sverigraven in the platform, uh, as the he's, he was working at QA

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:14.190
at Netflix. And I said, village, you're not my testing mentor and bounced ideas hard and

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:18.510
passed off of him and challenged. You know, I was like, I have this idea and he'd come up and I was

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.750
like, that doesn't feel right to me. And I didn't just accept what Villa said, even though

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:26.590
it was my mentor, I would challenge him because it just didn't seem to align with continuous

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:32.700
delivery. And so it was steel on steel, trying to get better at this stuff. It all came down to how

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:38.460
do I deliver workable software every single day? Right. It's just, how do I solve this problem?

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.580
So there's a characteristic here that I've been going to sound briefly. Like I'm blowing

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:49.740
smoke up your ass, but as a manager, there's a correlation. You don't have someone study.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:57.820
I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, well, let me just finish my thought because I think there's a correlation.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.900
There's a curiosity and drive in you. Like you had, you could have gone to your manager and said,

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:08.370
we need to hire testers. We'll, we'll just make them move faster or whatever. Or you could have

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:14.930
said there are many ways you could have given up and gone a different path, but you didn't. And

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:22.450
that curiosity to go discover, I think it's any knowledge work, being curious and wanting to learn

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:27.250
more and continually trying to discover what you don't know and what you don't know, you don't know

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:30.850
is absolutely a key to success. So there's a story in there as well.

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:38.610
Full disclosure. When we were making the shift, we also changed tech stacks and the new tech stack.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.890
I was not good at, and I was, uh, you know, it's very difficult to be a senior engineer

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:48.130
where the thing that this tech stack, your senior at no longer exists in your area.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.770
You need to become an expert at something quick.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.060
So I became an expert at how do we deliver better while I'm learning the new tech stack.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.700
Way back when Brent and I were both in test and he was, I think,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:11.340
I think we were still doing like kind of old school tile testing, but not the gatekeeper.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.940
Brent came up with this mission. Like, you know, testing's role is to accelerate the

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.580
achievement of shippable quality. And there's something there too. Like you,

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:26.500
you wanted stuff to go faster for good reasons. And then, I don't know, I think there's,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.260
I like the story there.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:34.580
Yeah. I mean, and going back to some of the core motivations I have, I've always,

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.260
I've not been a developer who's number one software, something hobby.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:44.820
Okay. I code because I need a tool. I have other hobbies, photographer, motorcycles,

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.940
I build models. I don't solve, I don't code for a hobby. I could solve business problems.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.740
I care about the business problem. I push back really hard on developers who say our

00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:02.270
job is algorithms and data structures. Our job is to be business experts solving business problems

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.310
with code. It's fascinating.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.230
Modern testing principle number one, our priority is improving the business.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.710
Yes. And everything, you know, I talked to people, how do you get people to buy into continuous

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:19.390
delivery? I don't. I get them to buy into how do we deliver better business value at lower

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:24.030
cost with less variability and less, you know, drama, right? You know, it's...

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:30.990
But Brian, I am a database expert and I don't care about all of that. I want to add the next

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.510
feature to my database.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.110
Okay. Well, go work for a database company.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:36.750
That is...

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:41.390
But, you know, and then that's a valuable attitude to have. But, you know, going back to your

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:45.070
question about why people think developers can't test. Well, it's because they can't,

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.110
right? It's not because that... Well, it's not because they can't, it's because they have no

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:53.760
idea how, because you... What's the main entry point for software development?

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:59.200
It's a computer science degree. We don't need freaking computer scientists.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:07.040
We need software engineers and that's completely different thing. And so people go to

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:14.700
university, they get a CS degree, they might be taught the basics of how to structure code.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:22.050
You know, they come into the workforce mostly illiterate and then we have to train them. And

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:27.440
if they wind up in the wrong organization, they won't get taught how to test. And then

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:32.560
they'll think that's just the right way to do it. And those organizations will have testing teams

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.600
and the testing teams will say, well, developers can't test. That's my job. Only I have the

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:45.740
mindset to think about what could go wrong. Right? It's like, apparently software is the

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:52.980
only discipline where only somebody other than the engineer of doing the work of designing the

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.020
thing can think about, you know, only somebody else can think about what can go wrong.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:02.660
I mean, that's why we have QA teams looking at bridges to decide how that can go wrong

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.820
while you have bridge engineers, you know, civil engineers only doing happy paths, right?

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:16.020
But they're not taught how to test. And, you know, you'll see me on LinkedIn having

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.140
these heated discussions with people who I'm looking at a point, they're looking at

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:25.300
a developer, so I had to test only I have the skills, I need to be the one testing

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.220
and explaining to developers what they're doing wrong. And it has to be an adversarial

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.780
relationship because that's how quality is done. And I'm looking at going, I'm a value stream

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:41.070
architect. You are a constraint in the value stream. That constraint is driving it backsize.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.790
The larger batch we deliver, the more wrong we are because the idea is fundamentally flawed in

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:51.710
the first place. That can't work. You need to teach the developers how to test and you need

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:59.230
to work on giving them better tools to get that done with. You need to don't grant, right? You

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:05.390
cannot be the person doing. If you're an expert, I value you for sharing your expertise and elevating

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:12.350
others. If you try to implement your expertise, I hate your guts because you're harming my quality

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:21.200
of life. We are on record. Absolutely in agreement. We view like, Alan, what is what's a synonym for

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:31.040
specialists on this podcast? Bottleneck. Yeah, you're gumming up the works. You are blocking

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:38.800
the business from achieving its value. Absolutely. In the dojo, the process we went through in the

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.640
dojo, like I said, it was immersive learning. And we would go and work with the team for six weeks.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:53.600
It was not unusual for many of the teams to have either an external QA team testing their code

00:39:53.600 --> 00:40:00.720
independently or to have test automators on the team whose job was to write end-to-end tests.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:09.790
By the way, god damn it, BDD does not mean using cucumber to write end-to-end tests after the

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:20.400
coding is done. Okay, Jesus Christ. BDD, TDD does not mean anything tests after coding is done.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.840
But what we would do is we go into the team. And so we have to change the entire way this team

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:32.830
works to go from the way they're working to continuous delivery. And we also could not have

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:37.710
those testers doing what they were doing. People always thought that I hated test that I hate

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:44.270
testers. I mean, I get accused of this all the time. I elevate testers when we did this.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:48.670
We go into the team and say, look, what you're doing right now, not only is it constrained,

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:55.710
but it's a waste of your talent. And whether they had the skill or not, we always granted

00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:02.910
the skill because we knew that if we challenged them that they would elevate or sort themselves

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:09.760
out. Okay. You're the quality expert on the team. The team doesn't have the muscle built.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.200
You need to help them build the muscle. You need to be the coach for this

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.990
and stop doing what you're doing now. Stop testing, start being a quality engineer,

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:26.500
help these guys learn how to test better. Talk about test design, share your knowledge,

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:36.690
share the mindset, share how to think evil, evil ways. And we had so many

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:46.350
ex-test automators who were just massive fans of the dojo because we made their lives better

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:53.300
because we gave them more important jobs. Oh, when I mentioned when I first went to dev,

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:58.180
one of the things that Microsoft famously did is actually collapsed the test team.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:07.540
And every new dev team was part dev part test. Okay. What I actually found was those old test

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:14.610
automators. It was a lot easier for them to start writing code, which felt like a reward to them,

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:23.250
but they still kept, they out delivered all of the old school dev experts.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:30.750
I'm not surprised. We used to tell the, what we would tell this test automator is just like,

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:35.550
hey, and if you get bored, pick up a feature because that'll also give you a deeper insight

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:41.790
into the challenges that developers are having with testing. You know, pick up a feature.

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:48.210
Now, and so this is, this is the big problem though, what we have in the industry and why,

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:54.370
you know, one of the, they've, they've hardly released modern software engineering a few years ago.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:43:00.510
And he sent me a pre-release of that book and I started reading it and I was like, oh my God,

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:06.210
that's this, this is the book because it explains to you what you're doing wrong as a

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:12.720
software developer. It challenge you to be a software engineer, to take the job seriously,

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.960
to apply engineering principles, to, to have the same mindset that you need to be a tester because

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.080
a software engineer has to have that same, what could go wrong? You know, I've carried a pager

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:30.400
for 20 years. I guarantee you, I can think like a tester. There's nothing that gives you a quality

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.360
mindset, like not having to wake up at three o'clock in the morning.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.080
And well, once you realize it's in your control.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:44.960
But, but here, this is the other thing, because having a, it's not enough to have a quality,

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.440
you know, a testing mindset and focus on quality if your feedback loops are truncated.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:57.180
Unfortunately, so many organizations design the system of delivery to make quality very,

00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:02.620
very hard to deliver. Okay. This, this concept of run what you've rung doesn't mean that,

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:08.060
that you own all of the infrastructure and everything to deliver your software. What it

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:14.110
does mean is that if you build something that when it breaks, you're the person responsible

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:23.460
for fixing it. Right. And that is a primary, very important quality feedback loop that

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:29.300
when, when we had an, you know, an ops team whose job it was to do level one, level two support,

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:35.860
so many defects were getting hidden until they became emergencies where it could have been,

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.340
if we'd found out about it early on, number one, we wouldn't have been keep building on top of

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:45.060
quicksand on top of something that's already unstable. They're patching together, not letting

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:49.900
us know about, but we could have killed it and nipped it in the bud before we got very,

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:56.300
very angry people yelling at us and, and, and, and gotten better at our quality process up front.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:02.380
And so to anybody out there who's in leadership who thinks it's a great idea to have a support

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.780
team support, supporting software that a development team is writing, you're wrong.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:13.730
You're harming your customer. Stop it. Move ops into the team, start a page, your rotation,

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:19.010
create an L one support team whose job it is, is to do triage, but not to fix anything

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:23.970
and wake people up. Your quality will improve. Yeah. That's exactly what did it. My last

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:28.930
company we had eventually we got to a place where we had the L one pagers and they took

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.530
care of everything that had run books like you need to bug anybody. We'll work around

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:37.570
the clock at distance and we'll make sure stuff gets filed. So it gets improved because

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:41.570
a lot of the run book stuff is stuff that's just going to go wrong. Yeah. And then,

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.930
yeah, but then people were, if something happened, they were brought in quickly and they owned it.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.770
And I love that. That's the way it's, to me, it's the way it should work.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:54.130
When, when they went through this maintenance, they called it project harvest, by the way,

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:58.610
this matrixing of the organization, we, we called it project Reaper because it just

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:04.940
absolutely destroyed our culture. But when they did that, you'd have, you know,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.060
number one, we had no way to train new developers on support because it was only L three and it

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:15.330
was only in the middle of the night because we never got day calls at all ever. And number two,

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:21.940
by the time we got on, instead of having somebody who was mildly annoyed because their job was kind

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:28.100
of getting disrupted a little bit, we were an hour and a half into the problem. And now

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:35.780
we're waking up trying to orient to what the issue is, probably have a VP on the line.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:42.270
Got a very angry person who, you know, in the UK or Mexico or someplace screaming at us.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:45.150
That's the best way to try to resolve an issue.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.590
Yeah, for sure. You know, I've been, you remind me in your talk there, I've been

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:57.150
about eight years ago or so, maybe nine years ago, sort of found myself into managing platform teams or

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:01.070
whatever you want to call them infrastructure teams. I don't like calling them DevOps teams,

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.070
but you know, I'm talking to you. Please don't call them DevOps.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:06.430
Yeah, I'm not going to. I'm just trying to appeal to the wider audience. But

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.990
so what I found in doing that, like very early on, because I had spent

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:16.510
seven in the industry, 30 years, about 20 years in mostly in test related roles,

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:21.070
maybe the last year that sort of more of a test coach, a little bit of a dev in the middle.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:28.580
Anyway, I realized six months into managing a platform team that, oh my God, I have more

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:35.300
control over quality in this role than I ever did at any time of my career, because I was building

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.940
tools to help make it easier for the developers to deliver as fast as they wanted.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:47.140
Yeah, no, I work for a company that does platform work for the government right now,

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:52.580
and it's a really important job. I can't think of anything better for any developer to do

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:57.700
than to work on platform if they take it seriously, if their role, if their goal

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.460
is to help other developers live better lives.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.460
Yeah, for sure. And one thing I want to talk more about, we're almost out of time, but one

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:12.500
thing I've noticed in being in this role and then talking to folks in similar teams and

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:19.780
other organizations is often this platform team is kind of treated like the ops team. Like they do

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:27.860
the, they do the CI for another team. It's like another pattern. Don't do that.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.980
They get, you got to, you got to build what you run or what do you say?

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:36.260
Run what you run, run what you brung, run what you brung. Yeah, I love that. And that's,

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:40.260
I want to, that's it. I want to enable teams to do that. Should be the goal of that platform team.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.420
Yeah. I mean, the platform at Walmart, we didn't build pipelines for anybody.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:44.980
No, no.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.820
Easy for people to build pipelines themselves. How can we build a, we don't know your quality

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.940
process. Exactly.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:54.340
That pipeline defines your quality process. All we can do is give you tools to make

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.420
that as easy as possible. Absolutely.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.980
And the whole concept of, oh, that's the DevOps team building pipelines for somebody else

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:07.700
is the most bankrupt version of, you know, misunderstood DevOps that I can think of.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.900
Yep. It's like, if you can think of anything more diametrically opposed to DevOps.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:19.220
It is. Yeah. Yeah. Especially DevOps is about everything the opposite of that.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.740
I gave a talk at QCon where I talked about the journey we went on

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:30.100
and how we replaced a scale agile framework with engineering and logistics at Walmart.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.420
And I talked about this concept of, you know, owning the pipeline. And then I asked if anybody

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:39.220
in the room was a DevOps engineer and built pipelines for people. And I had several people

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.060
raise their hands and say, please stop doing that.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:46.500
Yeah. That's what I tell them. Knock it off. Knock it off.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:53.680
We are just about out of time here. Man, it is so cool to get to hear these stories

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.760
and kind of your journey. It's just really impressive. People don't read the lighter

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:03.600
notes, the show notes. So if you want to, I know you have your blog.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.160
Yeah.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:08.080
Other, oh, and you have your DevOps podcast on YouTube.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.560
Sort of give us the rundown how people can get deeper into the world of Brian Finster.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:19.360
Well, I have a blog, the five minute DevOps blog on Medium. There's a reason why it's called that,

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:28.320
but we don't have enough time to go into it. If you go to blog.brianfinster.com,

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.320
you'll get there or rant.brianfinster.com will also get you there.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:38.240
Also, there's an open source project that we started a DevOps enterprise summit

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:45.600
several years ago called minimumcd.org. And the goal of that is to create, number one,

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.240
a minimum set of if you are doing these behaviors, this is the minimums to be doing

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:59.250
continuous delivery. If you do that, you will see these benefits. You won't see these benefits,

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:03.330
unless you're doing at least these behaviors. And they're the minimum set of behaviors that exist

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:11.410
in any context, air gapped, cloud, cat videos, metal and distribution centers. I don't care.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.890
We worked on these really hard. Dave Farley was one of the early signatories on that. He thought

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:23.170
it was good. We keep expanding on the knowledge base there, but it's just we learned a lot of

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:29.250
hard lessons and different, you know, the core team from multiple organizations, all of us have

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:35.220
learned hard lessons around CD. We're trying to make it easy for other people. And just,

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:40.560
I want to leave this with people again. You can't do continuous delivery unless you try.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:46.750
Trying to do continuous delivery will uncover so much organizational dysfunction,

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:53.630
so many skill gaps that if you just try to do it and just relentlessly fix those things,

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:57.630
you will wind up better off, even if you never get to real CD.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:03.550
That is also my experience. Brian, thank you very much. I do want to personally thank you.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:10.590
Like it was great hearing the story. I had not ever heard sort of the journey.

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:17.230
So you sort of landed in the same place, Alan and I are. And when it comes to the

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:25.790
mentality around how to do development, lifecycle management. But coming up through dev and coming

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:32.270
to that place is a unique perspective that I had not heard before. So thank you for joining

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.270
the podcast. Thanks for telling your story. Really appreciate it. I appreciate the opportunity

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:41.300
to share. Hopefully it helps somebody. Yeah, that's all we can hope for.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.380
Any one of our three listeners to grab a nugget and go, I can grow from that.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:51.060
Yeah. All right. Well, thanks everyone for listening. I'm Alan. I'm Brian.

00:52:52.820 --> 00:53:03.140
We'll see you next time.
