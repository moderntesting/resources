00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.460
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.860
Now, on with the show.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.860
Hey, everyone.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.860
I'm Alan.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.860
I'm Brent.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.460
And we're here for episode 128 of the A.B. Testing Podcast, your wonderful podcast for

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.460
all kinds of cool things.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.460
It's a story.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.460
No, don't sing.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.100
By a lovely lady.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.570
Do not sing.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.760
What have you been up to, Brent?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.080
COVID, COVID-Ding, I guess.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.200
COVID-Ding is cool, man.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.120
I really like being home in the same chair all day, every day, and talking to people

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.360
all day.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.940
It's great.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.940
Yeah.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.340
My wife asked me why I'm going to work, and it's essentially because I can.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.180
Because I cannot stand.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.900
I really cannot stand work coming to home.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
I like to keep those lives separate.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.150
I actually like working from here.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.150
Yeah?

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.150
Yeah.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.470
I was talking to the YouTube crowd before, and I'm actually taking some vacation days

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.170
at home coming up, because I was talking about the fact that Microsoft, Microsoft,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530
Microsoft, is it pronounced softer soft?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.530
I'm not sure.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.250
At Microsoft, you're limited on how much vacation you can carry forward from one year

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.700
to the next, but you always accrue vacation.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.060
Unity, same rule, you care, you limit on how much you can carry over, but there's also

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.570
a limit on how much you can accrue.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.090
Meaning I hit a max vacation I could possibly have, and I was no longer making more vacation

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.530
from my weekly work.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.530
Oh, I see.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.930
Lame-o, so I'm taking some vacation days to do some chores around the house.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.730
My first one's next week.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.730
I'm pretty excited.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.930
I'm a good old working forward week next week.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.090
That'll be fun.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.170
The other thing I've been doing is I now own a bunch of our Google contract, and I'm

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.690
doing a lot of work with finance to make sure our cost predictions are accurate, which

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.210
is a whole lot of fun.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.340
That's sarcastic, because I know how much I don't know.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.940
Gotcha.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.140
But we're getting closer.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.420
I'm faking it.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.500
I still find the right questions to ask, and we're getting there.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.600
We're getting there.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.440
I have no doubt that you will.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.120
The cost thing.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.700
Okay.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.690
Shall we go directly into the meat of the show?

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.690
It's a story.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.410
Oh, God.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.010
What did I say?

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.010
All right.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.180
Last time we talked about how you...

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.060
Even my dog is mad at you.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.140
We talked about how you got your start in testing and how you moved away from it and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.340
kind of how you stumbled into modern testing along the way.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.780
I want to tell my half of the story today.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.220
Hopefully, my dog will shut up.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.500
I shut my office door.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.860
I don't know if I should let her in, let her cry in here, or then she'll be quiet

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.860
or what to do.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.100
I'm going to let her do her thing and see what...

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.380
I think you should let her in.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.380
In a bit.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.380
So let her in.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.380
Oh, my God.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.920
Oh, my God.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920
Let's get started.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.400
And I'm going to count on you to ask questions appropriate or move me along as

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400
needed.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.570
I'll start at the beginning.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.570
I was born.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.510
No, I'll fast forward a little bit.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.710
I think most people know I was a music major in college.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.430
I graduated and I taught school for four years.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.950
I went back to grad school to get a master's in composition.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.790
While getting my master's, I learned how to use computers.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.790
This was...

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.070
I used a DOS-based music software notation program to do most of my work for grad school.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.470
I got really good at it.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.150
That company is no longer in business.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.990
I do have the source file still on some five and a quarter inch floppy disk so I

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.950
can do nothing with them.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.260
But after I got into grad school, I was actually planning on going back into teaching,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.140
but there was so much red tape after taking a year off to get back into teaching and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.380
fees involved that I just decided I was going to do something else first so I could make

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.300
the money to go back to being a teacher.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.020
So I got a job as a bicycle messenger.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.020
I live downtown Seattle.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.780
I did that for a while until it got really crappy.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.940
It was almost as toxic as some of my software teams I've worked on.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.900
But I bought a Sunday paper for you youngsters.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.220
A paper is a way people used to deliver news before we had to read it.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.740
And I got a Sunday paper and went through the Want to add.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.820
That's what we had before we had monster.com and LinkedIn.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.180
And I looked through all the Want to add, just kind of circling some random jobs to apply

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.180
for.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.180
This was 1992.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.180
Maybe 93.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.300
I don't really remember.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.620
93.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.980
And one of the jobs I applied for was to do tech support at a company that made music

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.940
software.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.060
And I applied for the job and I went through a rather lengthy interview which I finally

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.060
got the job for.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.180
A rather lengthy for an $8 an hour tech support job.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.420
I started about two weeks later.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.580
I showed up on my first day and they said, oh, by the way, you're also the software

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.580
tester.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.580
Another few hours went by and someone said, by the way, you're also our network administrator.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.640
This is what happens when you join a 17 person company.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640
I said, great.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.820
I've never used a network before this morning, but it'll be fun.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.700
So I learned as I went.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.700
Go ahead.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:53.460
It already sounds like that you started off towards exactly what our friend Jimbo describes

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.820
as the definition of the test position back in the day.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.660
Someone who does the remainder.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.700
Right.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.700
Everything else.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:09.580
Well, what I did there was I did tech support and on our peak days we got like 10 calls

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.940
and 90 plus percent of my calls were actually helping them with windows problems, not with

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:24.640
problems with our product because windows at this time windows 3.1 then there's windows

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.660
3.1 with multimedia extensions.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.020
People bought these sound cards and put them in their computer and tried to get them to

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.160
work and they didn't know how and there was this was before plug and play.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.600
Although I helped them edit their system any and win any file so their stuff would work

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.480
in general, not for our software.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.880
Once they got windows to work, our stuff would work fine.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.920
Very few of my questions about our software, but the rest of the time was fun because

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.050
one of the programmers there took me under his wing and made me learn C. He taught me

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.630
the three most important things you need to know about C.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.040
What are those pointers?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.830
Pointers and pointers.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.150
We got a beta version of the first version of MS test and I began to use that to write

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.030
some automation.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.190
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.190
I just automated everything.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.230
It was really stupid, but it was a good learning experience for me.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.870
I tried to use their API.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.190
I figured some stuff out.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.230
In the end, I ended up writing our setup programs because those were largely based

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.830
on visual basic, that setup language at the time.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.830
So that was fun.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.670
I was doing some stuff.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.470
I got promoted all the way from $8 an hour.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.760
I got a big raise to like $35,000 a year.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.480
Then for the second time, our CFO asked me to turn back the clock on our network

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.080
server so we could shove a few more sales into the current quarter.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.840
I thought, and this was a public company, by the way.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.960
I thought, you know what?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.360
I don't feel good about this.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.450
So I quit.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.570
Yeah.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.610
And by the way, not because of this, because I'm a parent, the worst things he

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.930
did, he is banned from ever holding office in a public company again.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.500
So the just desert said, follow him around.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.140
So I quit and I went home and I got out of paper and there was a bunch of

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.260
software testing jobs.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.300
I know what testing was now.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.380
I thought I was good at it.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.300
I didn't think I was great at it.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.380
I thought I was good at it because I could write a bunch of MS test automation.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.300
Raise your hand if you know a million testers like that today and just, just

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.180
substitute selenium for MS test.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.540
And I applied for a bunch of jobs.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.500
You know how I applied for them?

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.970
I wrote up a resume and a cover letter and I used my fax modem to fax it to

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.850
people because that's what we did then.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.130
This was 1994 end of 94.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.570
And then I maybe fall of 94 because I, my first day at Microsoft was the,

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.730
whatever the first work day in January was in 1995.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.560
And I was hired as a contractor and I worked, they hired me because I knew

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.760
testing and new networking.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.520
And this is where I have the famous quote of, I talked to my manager.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.680
He handed me this list of test cases in Excel.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.000
And I said, go great.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.480
When do you want these automated by?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.400
And he said, Oh no, we don't have time to automate.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.080
You need to run these every day.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.960
And I thought, huh.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.920
And I was bored of that.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.040
That was like a Monday out.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.360
I was bored by Tuesday.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.720
So I automated them by Thursday and then did a bunch of other work in

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.360
my other time.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.840
So I, I started breaking the rules around day three.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.760
Another good story from then is the story where we had a bug quota.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.400
I was expected to find like 10 bugs a week.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.710
And of course I would make sure I found, I re sorry, I would make sure I

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.870
reported 13 or 14 or 15 every week.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.790
Cause I wanted to exceed, but if I found more, I would save them for the next

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.470
week that didn't want my well to dry out.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.440
Oh God.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.200
So I worked there for a while and fast forward.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.840
I was on a six month pro contract.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.720
This was in the days of perma contract, but no one told me that it was just,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.880
it was just going to get renewed.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.840
So my contract began to end.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.800
I interviewed for other jobs.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.590
Okay.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.030
And I was offered a job.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.470
This is the story.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.470
I don't tell very often, but the job offer I got was from ST labs.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.690
I actually, uh, this was the company, one of my interviews with with James

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.460
Bach and they offered me a job and I took it.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.330
I said, yes, I'll take your job.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.010
And I went to my manager the next day and said, Hey, my contract's up in June,

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.130
beginning of June.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.650
So, so January, best spend like five months.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.090
But anyway, my contract's up.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.410
So I'm going to take another job.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.930
And he goes, looks at me with the face, like, whoa.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.710
And I said, well, my contract's up.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.390
So I got another job.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.910
So, uh, just want to let you know, I'm gonna start there in two weeks.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.630
And it was, this was a contract job at ST labs, by the way, but I didn't,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.230
you know, I was fine.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.150
I was young, healthy.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.630
It was good.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.510
So, wait, wait, pause.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.830
Yeah.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.870
Because you just said something that, that tweaks my head.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.630
So was it addition?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:04.750
No.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.150
Okay.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.590
There was eight months where I was a contractor and you know how

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.430
most contractors go through volt.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.550
I did not.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.430
My company was software testing labs.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.960
Is that the same company?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.520
It could have been, um, yeah, it is some contract.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.080
It was a contract testing place.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.280
I mean, they, yeah, it could have been.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.360
And Bach was what?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.880
Because I actually never.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.560
Wow.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.600
So I was going to work.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.680
I was going to, I was going to work at site on their, in their office in Seattle,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.800
which I thought was great.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.320
Cause I didn't want to commute to the East side anymore.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.960
So, you know, I told my boss that, and then I went to my office and I was

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.440
doing my work cause you know, I didn't have a short time or that it was thawing.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.080
I like working in software.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:54.520
But then his boss came to my office and said, Hey, uh, I heard the news from Doug.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:59.510
And I want to know if there's a chance we could get you to work

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.710
here at a full-time job.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.050
I was so confused.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.570
I would love to have had a poker face, but I said a confused face.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.770
I go, Oh, sure.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.450
That'd be an option.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:14.250
And they sent a goodie bag, uh, with an offer letter assigned to it, to my

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.650
house, like the next day.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.240
So, uh, yeah.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.960
And I said, I said, I, ST labs.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.480
And I said, well, I got a full-time job counter offer for Microsoft.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.400
I said, well, well, we can, I said, yeah, it's all right.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.360
I think I'm going to do this thing.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.360
So I did that.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.400
And of course in their hurry to hire me, they got my, but I supposed to go to a

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.040
new employee orientation, but in their hurry to hire me, they got the date wrong.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.920
So I never went, I never went to new employee orientation.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.440
I skipped it.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.880
And then I worked on windows 95 and networking that finished.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.120
I worked on what was going to be windows 97.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.720
And then I was part of Bill Gates discovering the internet.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.240
So I worked on IE two and IE three.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.000
I was, I didn't like working at internet explorer.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.880
So I moved back over to windows 98.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.680
I'm going to fast forward.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.200
I was on windows 98.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.000
I was doing a lot of API tests for networking, which was a ton of fun.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.040
I took all the GUI tests I did and I maxed them to a hundred, uh, testing at the API

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.400
level.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.680
So I, in hindsight, I don't think I need to test all that stuff, but I liked, I

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.320
liked learning.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.000
I liked writing tests.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.200
So I was, I was learning to write code pretty well in the end of 98.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.440
I was also writing most of the API tests for GDI and user.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.650
Those are the core components, the user level components of windows windows 98

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:34.010
shipped, I moved to the windows 2000 team.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.490
It was probably called something different then.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.530
And I worked on video capture drivers at the time when there were only about

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.610
three cameras available in total.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.490
This would have been 1999 or late 98.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.210
I worked on those for a while.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.130
I worked for a guy named Brad Carpenter.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.210
It was a ton of fun.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.090
Did a lot of work.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.090
There was no guidance on testing.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.050
I just wrote a lot of automation that made sense mostly at the API level.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:01.280
Again, I learned calm, calm, uh, component object model.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.680
And then I loved, I loved calm and then the marketing department said, Hey, man,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.040
we need to do another version of windows.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.960
We said, what?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.080
So we did another version of windows.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.280
They pulled a sort of a skeleton crew.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.160
This is the story I tell.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.120
I think I've told it on this podcast where I knew what I wanted to do.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.760
And our GM knew what he wanted me to do.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.720
Uh, during windows 98, we ignored debug windows and I love like turning up the

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.360
warning levels all the way up in my compiler, runtime analysis all over the place.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.260
We ignored the debug version of windows 98 and it does so much for

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.380
application development because of all the additional checks and asserts.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.860
And it would not boot.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.490
Wouldn't boot.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.960
Just like booting.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.080
You couldn't make it.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.480
You couldn't get it even get very far in the socialization.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.040
And I had a wonderful learning opportunity.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.040
So first off, I said, I want to work on this and Tom, our GM said, Oh, we'll go

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.680
talk to, to go talk to this guy leading our dev team.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.640
I talked to him.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.200
I thought he was a buffoon.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.500
I said, I don't want to work for this guy.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.860
We'll talk to Nick.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.260
Maybe we go talk to Nick about it.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.820
So Nick, Nick is kind of not, not as much of a buffoon.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.500
And I ended up doing that job working for Nick.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.500
I was going to be partnered with a person who was one of the pioneers in the windows

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.380
kernel, and he and I were going to pair on this.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.260
I was so excited.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.420
I was going to get to learn.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.140
And then I think the stock went up and he retired.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.100
So I had to do it on my own.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.980
And so this is where I learned x86 assembly.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.820
I'm probably going way out.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.540
I haven't got to modern testing yet, but I just, I like to make stuff go.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.220
I was mainly driven, not because I wanted to work in assembly because I knew

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.220
the value of having a debug version of this thing, even if nobody was ever going

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.750
to use it and I had a ton of fun on this product.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.910
This is where I pioneered some of Microsoft's initial static analysis

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.990
tools and fixed a bunch of those errors and windows and windows millennium.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.230
Me, which also stands for marketing edition, because it was the reason

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.110
marketing wanted us to ship it.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:05.950
Remember at that time, windows was the ship vehicle for a lot of products.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.630
You can just go to the internet and download stuff like internet hearts

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.750
and other crap like that.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.150
They wanted to, they wanted a version of windows to ship with.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.870
So there was, there was no app store then.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.990
Right.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.830
This is actually, we're finally getting somewhere.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:25.150
So after that shipped, uh, our, our GM or a VP went on to take over, uh,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.830
windows CE at Microsoft.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.510
So I went with him and worked on that.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:34.630
I managed the test team that did for a while that did all of our driver

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.110
kernel, everything, low level, actually everything except the actually.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.350
What didn't I didn't do graphics.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.880
Oh, actually, eventually I did graphics.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.920
So I ended up managing huge chunk of the test team.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.360
I decided I wanted to get out of being a manager for a while.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.360
I didn't, it wasn't, I don't like managing.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.240
I love managing.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.760
I don't really like managing at Microsoft that much.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.720
So my manager said, well, what do you get?

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.840
My manager said, I want you, you know, windows just made these test architects.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.960
I want you to be a test architect.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.040
So I became the first test architect outside of core windows over in windows

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.600
CE, and that's where I joined the test architect group, where we had these,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.560
these surreal discussions.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.800
This is also where I got a little bit of imposter syndrome and I began

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.810
reading books on testing and I read a book on testing and I thought, oh,

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.090
I know so much about testing.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.730
Oh, now I feel like a test architect.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.890
And then I read another one and I thought, Oh, now I'm a little bit confused.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.570
And then I read a third one said, Oh, now I think I need to form my own

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.410
opinions because there's a lot of BS in this technology.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.090
So that's, that's how I got thinking about testing.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.930
So fast forward.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:47.340
Also on that team, I built a CI system for our, because people were

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.740
breaking the build stuff was breaking.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.540
So we put a, put a gate in place where tests had to run.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.140
Uh, certainly wasn't continuous deployment, but we made people go through a,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.180
I was going to say, pause cause back then we did, we didn't call it CI.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.380
We called it a gate.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:03.780
Yeah.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.180
A gate or a gauntlet.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:05.580
Right.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.970
We, we didn't really have CI per se.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.850
Cause like the goals and the, and the, what happened.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.850
But what I've even, even without a title, we can get out of the semantics of it.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:26.090
Uh, in, in, you know, backsplaining or in hindsight, I was getting rid, I was

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:31.740
slowing the team down to speed them up and I didn't know why I was doing it.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.660
I'd never heard of lean at the time or anything, but I knew if we slowed down

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.340
a little bit upstream, it would be better downstream and that happened.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.850
So I worked on org for a while.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:42.610
I ended up moving.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.930
I ended up managing a small tools team.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.130
So it was kind of one of those ICs high level ICs that manages a few people

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.050
versus some manager, managing a lot of people.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.370
And that worked well for me, but there was an opportunity when Harry

00:18:55.370 --> 00:19:01.880
Robinson namedrop Harry went to Google and he was working in an

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.080
organization called engineering excellence, which at the time under John,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.800
it was John Devon reported to Bill Gates and engineering excellence

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.120
reported to John Devon.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.120
Oh, I want to go get that job.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.600
And I got that job as a test architect and I started doing technical

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.520
teaching, that sounds stupid.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.200
Yeah, I guess it was.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.280
I taught testing to test, to testers and designed some courses, gave some

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.640
courses, ended up running that team.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.180
Uh, Microsoft, I was Microsoft's director of test excellence.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.580
I was in that role when I wrote how we test software at Microsoft.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.660
Some of you may remember that gem.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.020
It's not that old.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.780
And then it was during that time that I met a man named

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.710
Ren Jenson, wait, this is, we did this last time where you

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.790
couldn't remember years again.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.750
No, no, no, no.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.670
Cause how did you get on?

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.310
How did you get on the TLT?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.030
Again, I was director of test excellence.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.070
And part of that job was to play sort of the chief of staff for the

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.470
Microsoft test leadership team.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.780
Okay.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.300
Got it.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.020
Got it.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:06.100
So that's, I think where I think maybe Whitaker had introduced us just

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.180
either before or during, but I was getting you to come to those meetings

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.080
and be a part of that group.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.680
Then at somewhere in there, you began coming to these test architect

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.640
group meetings again.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.800
That's where this podcast was born.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.260
Because we would have these conversations where we would have good conversations.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.780
And as much as I make fun of Brent, I respect him.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.740
And I think he's, I think he's smart and does a lot of good stuff, but I

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.060
know I can give him shit.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:39.100
We'll actually, by having a more vigorous debate, we'll actually get to a good solution.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.620
I think the reason the principles have held up, if you compare it to the ones

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.100
that originally wrote what we have now, they're fixed because we were able to

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.620
work together and debate and do those things, but we would have such animated

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.540
discussions during these test architect group meetings.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:01.240
That Michael Hunter, who I believe is now at Tableau said, you guys should do a

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:11.760
podcast with, and then the podcast was born sometime in 2014.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:12.920
Is that right?

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.720
You guys can, you guys can go look at that and figure that out.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:18.900
Yeah.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:24.260
So at this point, I am still tester, tester, tester, but I haven't really

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.740
done that much testing.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:33.460
I probably, it was probably since, uh, actually the, the last time I did full

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.620
time testing is like I do testing or test automation from as part as the

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:44.360
majority of my day would have been windows 98 because, oh, sorry, windows

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.080
2000 testing video capture drivers.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.720
After that, it was making debug versions of windows working on low level

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.120
components, I ended up being the person that debugged the kernel crashes and

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.160
the stress runs overnight.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.040
And I, I love that stuff.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.760
Uh, when I moved on to windows CE, I was a manager, so I wasn't testing that much.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.800
I did a little bit of brute force automation once in a while, but I was

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.240
mainly actually figuring out, I was doing again, debugging.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.160
I love debugging.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.600
I ended up doing a lot of it when I joined, uh, text excellence group.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.320
I for sure wasn't doing any testing.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.880
When I moved to Microsoft link slot was communicator, then it became

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.680
linked and then it became Skype for business later.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.740
But I worked on that.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.060
Even there I was coaching testers.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.020
I was teaching testers to do exploratory testing, not developers, but testers.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.380
Uh, and having fun with that from there, I went to Xbox where

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.060
I worked on infrastructure.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:43.100
I forgot that there were two teams we were on just again, twice.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.700
You were on the server side.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.820
Holy crap.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.140
I was on link.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.180
You worked on server.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.500
I worked on the client team.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:57.220
No, when I think when you were on, when you were on link, I was in media center

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.100
and then media center through a series of reorgs.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.100
That's how I got on the Xbox.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:12.480
And by the time, by the, yeah, I'm trying to remember where was

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.360
ever a time I was on link server.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.600
I don't remember if we were ever on link at the same time.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.440
Watch Brett quit enjoying unity right when I retire.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.280
No, no.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:22.840
Actually.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.080
So yeah.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.360
Okay.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.280
So I want to get to the modern testing parts.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.720
So all that.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.440
So I've been in all these roles.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.400
I've been test architect manager.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.880
Uh, it was, so we began talking.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.680
It was probably around the time I was in Xbox doing infrastructure that Brent

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.120
to tie it kind of tie these timelines together, that Brent was doing agile

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.360
stuff in being, I thought, cool.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.240
For the record, uh, the infrastructure, I can't even call it a team.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.240
I ran infrastructure on Xbox as a virtual team.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.560
It was all just open source style, inner source style.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.200
There's one thing actually.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.800
So by that time you were no longer, well, obviously you were no

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.830
longer in the education org.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:09.230
Right.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.390
I went from the education org or the ex engineering excellence org to

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.110
link and then to Xbox.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.030
But you'll correct me if I'm wrong.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.710
But if I, if I remember correctly, even when you left, you still

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.670
ran community events.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.310
Yeah.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:29.300
I kept running, uh, not test leadership team, but there was a, uh, at

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.600
one point our T kind of off, maybe it, maybe it's relevant.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.480
Uh, we had a technical commuting, technical TCN technical.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:39.680
I don't know.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.320
Q tech.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.800
Well, TCN came to me and said, Hey, we want to have a group of senior

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.640
level people in the testing profession.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.880
Remember we're still siloed.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.840
There's still massive test teams are still 10,000 testers of Microsoft.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.200
So just the senior people want to get together.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.280
Cause we have funding to do that.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.160
And they, they had a lot of money to feed us food.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.920
We went to baseball games.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.200
It was soccer games.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.840
It was great.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.320
And then we had the quality and testing excellence community, which I ran

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.080
for about two years, uh, and then TCN went away and I got my time back.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.340
I was an Xbox.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.980
Brent was learning agile.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.500
I'm getting him to talk on panels and be part of these Q tech

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.780
conversations is agile.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.620
Still very different, but it's dark conversations.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.620
Like in that time you can accelerate the achievement of simple quality thought.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.020
Oh yeah, I get that.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.420
When Xbox shipped, I went on a sabbatical and I came back.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.620
Actually I took a ton of time off.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.340
I went to Australia for a month, came back for a few months, went to France

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.580
for three months and then came back.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.060
But during that time I was working on the stupid science project known as

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.780
Astoria, which was the dumb thing to make windows app.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.380
Sorry to make Android apps run on windows phone thought it would

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:55.020
have been a much easier effort just to build just to make the window shell

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.740
or run on the Android phone, but whatever.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.580
I'm not in charge.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.280
That product was never going to ship, but I wanted to learn Java and

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.960
I wanted to learn Linux and it was fun.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.000
I just did random things, took it on.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.480
It was great.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.000
Uh, I got bored.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.480
I got so, so bored.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.120
I loved my manager, but I was bored and I told him I was bored.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.920
He said, yeah, I don't know what to do.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.320
I don't want you to leave, but maybe you should.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.080
So I did.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.520
And this is where I was because we didn't have a test team.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.760
This was the big move that happened.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:31.600
Then is I skipped the whole big important chunk in the early parts of this org.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.760
We didn't have, we moved from X box to the stupid app and

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.800
we didn't have any testers.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.800
This is my first time coaching testers on how sorry, coaching

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.840
developers on how to write tests.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.470
Can't believe I almost skipped this part.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.630
I did most of it through code review.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.980
I would ask questions like, Hey, where are the tests?

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.140
Oh yeah.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.660
We're going to get those in the next check-in.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.020
Uh, no, you should probably test check in the test now.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.020
Really?

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:00.740
Yeah.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.460
Cause how, why does the code work?

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.020
Oh, I get where you're going.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:05.220
Yeah.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.060
I'm going to write some tests.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.810
And so I have a few of those conversations eventually gets to, Oh great.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:11.490
You have tests.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:12.490
And then I critique the tests.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.770
Why does your test doing 15 different things?

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.400
When your test fails, how about you?

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.200
Like I've gone through this pain for you.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.160
So when your test fails, if your test fails, no, when your test fails, maybe

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.480
you should have some logging to know why.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.040
Well, I'll just hook up the debugger.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.480
Is that really the most optimal way to do?

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.240
Oh, I get.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:31.720
Yeah.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.080
Oh, that's cool.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.800
Good idea.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.720
And then for all these things, the more I bring them up and then other

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.100
people would almost got to be a, what would Allen say?

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.100
And then after awhile, I wasn't needed to be on to pay attention to code

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.500
reviews because all the questions I was asking about improving tests

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.500
were getting asked by others.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.340
So it was great.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.860
And again, I didn't care too much because the product was stupid.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.020
So then I moved to, I moved from there to, uh, this was fun.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.400
I moved to what eventually became Microsoft teams.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.760
And we all know this story.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.320
I love the product for awhile.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.280
They didn't have any testers.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.240
They hired me because I knew about testing and a big part of my job

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.200
was to coach the help developers do better testing.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:23.060
I did on some places and other places, they were just happy to have their code suck.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.940
I won some battles.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.140
I lost some others.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.940
And what they gave me was a million dollar budget to go hire contractors

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.980
offshore to help get this testing done.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.820
The idea was it for it to be a stopgap.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.260
So they keep moving forward while they address their backlog of missing tests.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.740
And to be clear, they had a hundred, this is, I'm sure you've all seen this.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.020
They had a hundred percent or not a hundred.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.820
They had like, seriously, like 90 plus percent code coverage on their unit

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.260
tests across the board.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.220
Nice.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.060
And what does that mean for quality?

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.010
It means it's perfect ship it.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.130
Or you're missing 5%, but who cares?

00:28:59.370 --> 00:28:59.690
Yeah.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:05.930
There's, there is so much in conversation I've been having even today is the gap

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:10.050
between works and good is much bigger than people think.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.900
And, um, code coverage covers, which of those topics?

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.300
It covers works kind of covers, covers some of what's major tests covers the code.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.620
Does it mean the code works?

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.420
Anyway.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.500
So I learned a lot cause actually I found out, this is where I really found out.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.180
Cause I was doing less code review and more kind of hands on working

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.380
with folks and then the test.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.540
This is where I really discovered that, wait a minute, developers can really

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.700
do good testing and even though I complained about them missing some stuff

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.700
that could have been automated.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:46.260
When I sat when I said, okay, let's, let's do a hate, hate it, but we did a bug bash.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.060
Let's, let's work on finding bugs and I gave them ideas.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.220
I gave them some heuristics.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.180
I gave them Elizabeth Henderson cheat sheet and we had developers find bugs

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.580
that I think only the best testers in my career would have found.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.540
They absolutely were able to pick.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.300
They just needed to know it was okay to, to use their brains and

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.660
engage and do some testing.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.180
And I had light bulbs going off that.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.380
Oh my God.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.620
I spent so much of my career and we need to backtrack a little bit here.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:19.620
When I was in test excellence, my job was to celebrate the career and profession

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.660
of the software tester at Microsoft.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:27.820
We had 10,000 testers and I worked on career paths extensively to describe

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.740
what it would be like for testers to grow all the way up to the highest levels.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:37.380
And man, the cognitive dissonance, when I taught developers to be that good

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.340
and testing that quickly, it's like, holy shit.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.300
I wish I knew then what I knew now because I did a bunch of shit wrong.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.570
I learned a lot there about teaching developers to test and in, we weren't

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:56.010
very agile, but we, I learned a lot of things about shipping in an agile way.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:00.990
So we're able to ship our services on demand, which was great.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.670
We shipped our front end once a week.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.310
I wish we could have shipped it more often.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.630
And that's, if I think I would have stayed, what would have got to

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.630
a stage where we did that.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:16.230
I know after I left, they did so much of non feature flagging and shoving stuff

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.790
in so that we could weekly release that customers asked them to slow down the

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.550
cadence, I don't know if that's better or not now, but we did a lot of cool,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.510
all the cool deployment tricks for the blue green deployments.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:31.670
And we did, we actually deployed our, what was going to be the

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.430
next week's build in rings.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.590
They still call rings, their rings or circles.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.950
So like, we just push them buttons.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.250
First it went to just me and my organization.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:47.010
And then once our test team did their steps and yes, it's pretty good.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.090
We'd roll that out to all of the organization, then to all of Microsoft

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.730
before we'd really sex, internally.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.290
And I love that, that phased rollout.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.490
We did it in steps versus a slider, but learned a lot about how to

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:02.250
deploy in the, in the real world.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.850
So I got fed up with my manager for being a dick and I quit.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.740
I had a new job.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.750
I, I, I talked to the folks at unity and they said, Hey, well I said, Hey, uh,

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.230
I'm thinking of leaving Microsoft.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.980
Do you have any jobs?

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.140
Cause they had approached me like a two years before I said, actually,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.220
I don't have that other job.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.180
I have a new job.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:24.580
And I said, what is it?

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.940
We need someone to run our services QA.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.300
I said, question one, what is services QA?

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.540
And they said, Oh, all of our guy was my boss for all.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.260
I didn't really know.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.940
It's like, Oh, we have a bunch of stuff that it's in the internet.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.460
In the internet.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.580
What it ended up being is when I described it, it was all the parts of unity

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.540
that use the internet.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.300
It was everything from the website to some stuff in the editor to things

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.500
that are peer services like analytics and ads.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.540
And anyway, I, this was a great job because all my interviews were all about

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.820
getting to know fit and feel and not about stupid whiteboard things.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.860
And they never even asked for my resume until they forgot that they needed

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.860
it in order to give me an offer.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.020
They're like, Oh, Oh yeah.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.460
Just realized you know, resume from you.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.060
That's cool.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.500
Here's one.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.660
And so I started in, I didn't, of course, I spent my last two

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.220
teams not having QA, but I didn't join.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.260
And you remember this next, we were talking a lot about this as I joined.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.020
And I still remember our very last podcast at Microsoft when, uh, we drank

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.860
some tequila together while we podcasted.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.940
That must've been a while back.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.860
I didn't join unity with like, Oh, now I'm going to get rid of these testers.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.860
I joined unity thinking, this is going to be fun to manage a QA team.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.780
And the challenge there for me was learning how to manage a

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.300
globally distributed team.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:46.580
Very little of my team was in Seattle with me or Bellevue.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.810
Worldwide, the unity Bellevue office is known as the Seattle office

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.090
because, uh, who knows where Bellevue is.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.930
Right.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:58.970
This is a lot fresher in my mind, but I remember a point when I realized

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:03.050
you know what this is because they're all, it was agile ish across the board.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:06.170
So all of my org were embedded into other teams.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.210
And I was there to help them and coach them, help them to do the right

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.730
things and give them advice and things.

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.610
And that's what I realized, maybe it was on a podcast.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.450
I said, it's really a community.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.280
And then like literally like less than a month later, I was rereading agile

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.500
testing and Lisa and Janet said the same thing in their book and agile

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.220
manager's job or agile test manager's job is to run a community paraphrase.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.540
I thought, Oh, well, I'm glad I'm just discovering this now.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:39.040
It got to a point, maybe six months in when I realized that the right thing

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:46.350
for me to do for unity's business and for the career of these people was

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:51.720
to get rid of them all and I fired none, but I helped all of them move

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.280
into different roles at unity into dev roles, into quality coach roles,

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.520
into DevOps roles, someone well respected.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And he knows I'm talking about him.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:08.040
Someone well-respected across our entire org, who was a QA lead reporting to me.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.280
And now he's like the, one of the most respected DevOps folks across the org.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.320
It's probably the most I didn't set out to just see what the right thing to do.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:22.600
So within 18 months or so, or maybe two years, it took me two years.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:27.800
And it's funny how Brent used to joke about how I changed jobs every 18

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.960
months to two years and said, no, I don't, but mother effers, right.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.760
Confucius say find the job you love and you'll never work a day in your life.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.840
So I'm going to talk about even my new job now or what's happened since then.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.960
After about two years, I, my team was gone.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.000
So I moved into what was then called our monetization org, which is

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.200
ads, some other businesses.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.840
Now it's a much bigger org and I have many more cool responsibilities.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.880
But it was really those first two years of me at unity and going through that

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:05.280
process is where we solidified and in my head really embraced what is modern testing.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:13.480
That was the question I was going to get to is, is, um, like to me, your

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:19.520
experience on teams feels very much like how I felt about my experience on Xbox.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.240
You and I had fundamentally different experiences in that organization.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.160
Um, I was lucky enough to be put into a position where I was, my role was to do

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.640
whatever the hell I wanted, as long as I provided value.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.120
So it was, it was good.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.640
It was easy to have fun, but anyway, go with Xbox.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:36.960
Yeah.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.550
No, I, when I left Xbox, a big part of it.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:46.550
And in, I tell people don't leave a team, go to a team.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.270
Um, in that particular move, I did both.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:55.710
I was very much motivated to get out of Xbox because I thought the culture

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.870
was just entirely dysfunctional.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.880
And then I wanted to go to a team that claimed that they were doing agile and,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.280
uh, was actually happy about it.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.960
And they were doing services.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:14.660
I wanted to go, I wanted to go and find a place where I could learn by

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:22.300
entrenching myself, um, how software works differently in that environment.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.980
And it sounds like teams was that for you, teams was sort of your Xbox.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.540
It was like, I learned, I learned a lot in teams.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:36.260
I used to say on teams that it wasn't until I ran all of the infrastructure

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.660
in DevOps that I really began to have an influence over quality.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.300
And I've heard some, I've heard people say that too.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.420
Like there's so much ability to have influence in a good DevOps team.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.300
So I learned that there.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.540
I had so much influence over the quality by controlling our deployments

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.300
and having an understanding of how to deploy.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.140
I learned a lot of basis.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.860
It was just a little bit of a toxic environment and it wasn't a product in

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:05.500
the end, I loved anymore because product mistakes being made in choosing to.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.990
Again, going back to lean, I had also developed my own principles by

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.950
doing small things well, and those things weren't happening.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.190
I didn't have control over that.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:18.750
I just had control over the, the end of the sausage maker, but I learned a lot

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:25.850
about influencing quality and how I can control that from a, uh, infrastructure

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.000
point of view and the same thing is then three years later or two

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.880
years, two and a half years later, I got the hang of it.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.800
I realized that now I own those same things plus program management.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.000
And don't get confused on the Microsoft program management, but I control

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.800
the aspects of how our engineering teams do their estimations and deliver

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.760
and get, get them to think about the things they need to think about

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.640
to be ready to work and to be done.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.480
Now I have even more control over the quality of our products.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.880
Cause I, I control the whole sausage making machine.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.680
The other teams I work with focus on product development, everything I do

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.320
and my teams do enables them or blocks them.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.280
It puts them, puts the right guard rails up, I should say, so they

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.360
can deliver quickly and effectively and with quality.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.760
So I definitely learned some of that basis in teams going into my time at

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:22.030
unity while I loved accelerate the achievement of quality.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.790
And I think we had already had the modern versus traditional much earlier.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.910
I believe I was still at Microsoft when we had that debate.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.000
I can't quite remember.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.180
I don't think so.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.580
I look, I feel like we recorded that one in Lincoln square.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.060
I have, I have a memory.

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.700
It could be, I could be wrong, but worth looking up.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:48.700
It was definitely while I was experiencing a team or teams moving from

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.110
traditional, even if it was actually, they were moving from agile or fake agile.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:58.790
And again, Lisa will probably listen to this episode eventually agile testing,

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.870
as she and Janet describe it is wonderful.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:07.110
Too many times in my experience, it wasn't, it was still the embedded

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.750
tester was the one doing all of the testing.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.790
And that's unfortunate, but I saw his teams were the embedded tester was doing

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.550
all the testing and wanted to move that to real whole, whole team quality.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.790
When did, when did you move to unity?

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:25.590
Uh, January, it spent almost four years because Barack Obama and I both

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.950
quit our jobs on the same day.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:31.790
So we recorded that on September 2017.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.660
Oh, wow.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.380
Yeah.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:34.900
Wow.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.940
It was after.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.300
But then the principles came up and I really think we formed, I don't know if

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.420
I've answered, I think without answering it directly and walking through that, I

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:49.420
think maybe I've answered the question of how I came out of my career ended up

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.780
getting to modern testing.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.380
It was sometimes it was actually rarely purposeful.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:00.110
Here's the thing that I think that I realized that is common in both of our

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:00.710
stories.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:05.910
Number one, there was an element of just had it with the dysfunction

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:12.790
that caused us to move on the team where I'm where, and then move on to a team

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.350
where number one, we both had autonomy.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:23.700
Uh, well, actually we both had an autonomy around how we would execute software.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:34.750
And we both made a decision to try out this agile lean thing and furthermore,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:43.310
realized, holy effing crap that completely works so much better than pretty much

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.990
the best thing I had learned in the last 20 years.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.190
I'm drawn towards efficiency.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:49.680
Yeah.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.620
In fact, I loathe inefficiency.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:42:00.450
So if I see a better way of doing something, I'm drawn toward it and it's

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:04.770
just something I've definitely discovered, especially in the last, uh, few years.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.180
Yeah.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:11.980
I remember in, in, in, again, you weren't pursuing, uh, you said it like, Hey, the

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.980
first thing I did was realize I needed to get rid of my team.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.220
No, it actually, it actually took several months for me to get, that wasn't

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.700
what I wanted to do at all, but it got to a point I was like, Oh God.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.020
Yeah.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.620
I'm the, the, the orb, the light that I was being drawn towards was one

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.100
more, he didn't have dedicated testers in our services orgs.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.980
No, but that wasn't what you were trying to do.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:37.140
What you were trying to do is get rid of the, uh, what do we call it?

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.500
The co-dependency.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:39.900
Yeah.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.820
I was trying to ask, I was trying to run an effect.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.590
Safety net, right.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.310
Um, the,

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.590
I'm pointing out that one thing really cool to call out is during that time,

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:53.070
one of the things I did in building this community was I had 90% of my team,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.750
plus some guests hang out with me in Bellevue for three days.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:57.790
And Brent came and gave a talk.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:42:59.980
Yeah, that was fun.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.300
That was fun.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.500
The there's, there's three times you asked me to come into a talk.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:10.400
One was, uh, that agile panel, uh, way back in the day, way back

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:17.000
at Microsoft at Q tech, the second one was around the combined engineering

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.200
transformation.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.480
I had left big at that time and I was executing it in the power BI org.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.480
You asked me to come and talk about that.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.320
I remember, I remember, uh, very fondly that one cause your joke then.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.360
Do you remember what your joke was when you introduced me?

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.120
No.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:42.970
Uh, you said some of you may or may not know, uh, this person, I don't know how

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:49.130
he's going to do a 30 minute talk because I'm fairly certain he can't even

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.450
pronounce his name in short than 10 minutes.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.010
Cause it all true.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.490
I would say the same thing today.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:57.830
That's not a joke.

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:59.750
That's just, that's just expectations.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.510
Yeah.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:04.470
So it was well framed because you, you started it off with that challenge.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:08.910
And I remember I nailed my time, but you're right.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.510
If you hadn't done that, I probably would have been the cause for going over.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:17.310
And the third time was, uh, was a sort of a data culture discussion.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:27.420
Uh, it was actually, uh, essentially the modern data oriented techniques for

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.620
looking at and improving quality.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:30.860
Right.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:37.260
And that actually eventually became one of the decks that AST did or asked me to do.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.800
And it's up on YouTube now for those who care.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.720
I'm still thinking through your story and the similarity.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.920
And I think the similarity is these were sort of things that we've been

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.200
actively thinking about for a while.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:57.760
I can even maybe even, uh, generalize this more is one of the things we wanted

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:03.400
to do when we started the podcast was help people who were going through any one

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:09.460
of these transformational changes and help them understand there was a greener

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.860
grass on the other side.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:16.400
And one thing common between you and I is we embrace change.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.280
We're not afraid of change.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.200
We'd like to try new things a lot.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.720
And we're not worried about screwing stuff up.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.040
We just want to try new stuff.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:23.960
Yep.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.440
The concept of best practices, uh, hum, uh, that humbles me.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.760
That would be the exact opposite direction.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.520
Uh, a noise, uh, irritates me greatly, right?

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.400
Best practices are now.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:40.330
Right.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:45.170
Uh, anyone who studies systematics knows that once you have a current practice,

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:51.730
you got it eventually the whole system readjusts and constructs new problems.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.210
Like a example email came out emails.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.090
Fantastic.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.850
It's fast, right?

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.650
I can, I can, I don't have to write a letter.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.850
I can, I can just type a letter, send it to Alan in five minutes.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:08.850
And I don't have to call him going, Hey, did you get my letter yet?

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:09.850
Did you get my letter yet?

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.730
But then what happens is it creates a new problem.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:14.610
Okay.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:19.770
It reduced the friction also for all the people who I don't want to get crap from.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:22.810
So now I'm buried by emails.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:25.090
Like I, uh, I get calls from Alan.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:29.890
Hey, Hey, Brent, I sent you an email like three days ago that

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.410
you haven't responded yet, right?

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.370
I get the same, goes back to the same initial problem.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.930
I've never called Brent, but I do remember this guy, Carl,

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:41.450
windows CE would he'd, uh, I'd see you walk up to my door and just stand there

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.730
in my doorway, we had, we had offices, the doors you say, did you get my mail?

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:46.390
I don't know.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:47.670
Well, can you read it?

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.140
I know all the time.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.260
No, I can't read.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:57.690
I probably got your mail.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.210
Send me, send me a dead tree mail.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:02.700
All right.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:06.460
So I like the parallels there, the parallels.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.620
We got to kind of wrap up here.

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.980
So what, so that's kind of where I got where Matt and ask me, ask me a question.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:11.180
Yeah.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.140
One question.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:23.510
So for me, I can remember like yesterday when, when it all clicked in and why I

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:30.430
knew this was actually correct versus me just rolling the dice and go, I'm

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.990
pretty confident in this is going to work, but not actually knowing.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:42.390
Did you have such an, an aha moment where you go like, Oh yeah, I am never,

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.590
I am never ever going back.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.660
Kind of, kind of.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.660
And for me, you know, we had talked about this stuff and I had done it in practice.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.700
I thought, well, maybe there's more context I'm missing and it's not working.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.380
And probably not only going to work if I'm there and it's just too much.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.140
And then I went, we came up with the principles and we thought they were

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.580
going to keep on changing for a long time, but they really haven't changed.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.860
And I presented them at test bash in 2018, I believe.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.740
And the number of people that came up, this is a test conference.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.420
I thought I was going to scare the crap out of them.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:16.420
Right.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.580
The number of people that came up to me afterwards and said, Oh my God,

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.800
you're describing exactly what I do.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.080
Thanks for putting a name to it.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.480
I thought, what, what?

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.080
Cause I had given a talk a year earlier called testing without testers.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.360
And I don't think I even believed it was really how I did it and how it kind of

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.400
could be done and how I was cheating by using contract testers, but it was

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.000
really talking about coaching developers.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.790
But moving from there to the principles and covering everything that

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.030
kind of has to work together.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.150
And so much of that, as you and I will agree is stolen from lean and the lean

00:48:53.150 --> 00:49:01.220
startup and agile testing that you kind of backsplend our way into that.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.940
But it really was probably test bash.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.940
When I thought when it became something I thought worked for me, that's something

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.540
I knew could work for everyone.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:10.570
That was my, aha.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:11.890
Okay.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:17.570
And I got to tell you, I've had groups I don't even work with at unity as late as

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:21.410
last week, pull me into a Slack channel conversation.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.140
Hey, Alan, we're doing this thing.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.060
I can't tell you what it is.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.900
Uh, how do you think modern testing principles would apply here?

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.580
I don't even know you and you're talking about, Oh my God.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:39.340
Wait, wait is model modern testing principles, like a, a, a well-known

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.860
brand within unity.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.340
No.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:47.860
I mean, no, I, I have done no, I've done zero evangelism inside of unity.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.340
People just find it and go, Oh, Hey, this looks valuable.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.740
And they try to say, Oh, and this guy works here.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.340
This is cool.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.380
Or the other way around, like who the hell is this guy telling us what

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.900
to do LinkedIn search, uh, angry.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.300
We, well, what the hell, right?

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:06.060
Maybe goes the other way.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.540
Happened more than once.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.540
That's the, that's cool.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:15.510
The, um, yeah, I remember back in the day, no one's asked me to do this, uh,

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:19.710
in a while, but back in the day, I had teams coming out of the woodwork,

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:23.710
asking me to walk them and onboard them to agile.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:24.590
Yeah.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.470
I remember.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:28.750
All right, man, we got to close it up, but we're back on for

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:29.830
every two weeks now, right?

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.710
Yeah.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.670
Cool.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:32.030
Cool.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.350
Hope you all enjoy the new time.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:35.270
New bat place, all that stuff.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:36.230
I'm still Alan.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:37.230
I'm Brett.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.830
We'll see you next time.

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.410
On the AB testing podcast.
