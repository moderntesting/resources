WEBVTT

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.900
Hey Alan.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.420
Good morning.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.660
Good morning to you.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.660
So we are back again for another episode of A.B. testing.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.100
Yes, number 80.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.940
Holy cow, nice even round number.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.180
And a good little milestone on the way to 100.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.020
It is, I like it.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.320
Which we will not hit this year, I don't think.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.720
Unless like a bunch of stuff happens and we go crazy.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.800
We took a little time off from podcasting.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.950
We skipped last time two weeks ago.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.790
Yes.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.610
Life happened.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.210
Life indeed happened.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.650
I am sorry for that Alan.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.410
It was the last second thing.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.890
I am, I am happy to give our listeners a break

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.350
from us rambling for 45 minutes.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.330
But you'll be happy to know,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.810
it's usually we're rambling for an hour

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.450
and I edit out down to 45, 50 minutes.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.130
Yeah, hour-ish round.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.360
Sometimes I add stuff and just put some things on repeat.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.280
They don't notice.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520
They just heard random droning from a couple old guys

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.840
talking about crap ideas.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.570
I bet you we could actually do that.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.170
So, A-B testing is, and I need to write this down,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.170
some day a podcast about, from Alan and Brent,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.250
that's what the A-B is for,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.530
but we talk about testing, software quality,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.150
agile, leadership, change management,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.710
agile, agile testing, and most recently,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.570
this thing we've been talking about

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.930
for a year now on the podcast,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.770
or maybe actually in depth for a year,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.490
but for a lot longer, is modern testing.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.440
I got a tweet today.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.280
That's great.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520
I know, it was very exciting.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.320
No, I got a tweet today.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.540
Apparently, years ago,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.720
I had commented on someone's blog post.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.000
This was like 2013, and he was talking about,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.040
I think test needs to go in a certain direction.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.940
And I'm like, yeah, the only thing I can see

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.480
on your thing was that you're missing

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.680
something along the lines of using telemetry data

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.090
to understand the customer.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.850
So he circled back and was like,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.170
hey, this sounds a lot like MT.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.970
And I'm like, yeah, you know what?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.450
Sorry for the delay.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.050
I guess we kind of figured out

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.330
what that something bit was all about.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.490
Okay, okay.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.850
Hey, speaking of Twitter.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.690
Yeah.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.330
I woke up this morning and looked at Twitter.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.570
Not the first thing, I'm not Donald Trump,

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.930
but I was looking at Twitter,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.770
kind of catching up on stuff

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.450
because I had some notifications on my phone,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.290
and Andrew Morton tweeted,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.250
I met Andrew at Test Bash.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.020
By the way, welcome Ministry of Testing listeners

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.220
if you're new, because this is the month

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.060
where if you are looking at your Ministry of Testing

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.900
calendar for 2018,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.260
you'll see a nice little orange thing.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.060
Let your eyes wander to the orange rectangle.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.940
And April is sponsored by AB testing.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.780
Yes.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.940
So if you came here because of that calendar

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.980
to check us out, that's fantastic.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.820
We love you.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.660
Thank you very much.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.940
Anyway, I met Andrew at Test Bash.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.220
Andrew is the new dev boss at Test Bash,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.300
but we played some card games together.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.740
Played Flux.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.980
I don't know what Flux is.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.820
Oh.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.580
Or what a dev boss is.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.940
Oh, so he does the development

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.780
and Ministry of Testing.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.530
Everyone's a boss.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.090
Okay. Richard is the boss boss.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.290
That's a title?

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.570
Yeah. Boss boss?

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.410
Yeah, boss boss.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.230
He's a dev boss.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.650
Anyway, not the point.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.690
Not the point.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.810
Still not the point.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.250
But now, tangent time, Flux.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.770
Flux, I play, it is fun.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.810
It's a card game where you try

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.920
and accomplish the goal using rules,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.400
but the rules and the goal change throughout the game,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.910
depending on what cards you play.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.710
I think that summed that up pretty well.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.710
I think I summed that up pretty well.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.390
Yeah, we should play On the Air sometimes.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.270
That'll be a fun podcast.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.390
Can you play it two player?

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.960
I think, I don't see why you couldn't.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.640
But anyway, if I recall,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.100
and I think I do recall.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.900
Are you and Andrew now playing over Twitter?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.340
No, no, he won.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.180
He won.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.500
And I don't even hold it against him because he was cool.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.780
But the point I'm actually eventually going to get to

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.980
and maybe get to faster,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.040
depending on how much of this I edit out,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.640
is that he was on the latest episode

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.780
of Desert Island Discs.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.620
Cool.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.540
Which is the Ministry of Testing podcast

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.940
or sponsored podcast from Neil Studd

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.700
on Desert Island Discs.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.380
If you remember, I did episode five.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.220
Yes.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.020
In the 2017, Andrew is Test Chef on Twitter.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.620
If you want to follow him just straight away.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.010
But the cool thing is,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.570
is Andrew gave a nice plug for not only,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.990
he talked about my Test Bash talk on modern testing,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.450
but he gave a nice plug for A-B testing.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.290
Sweet.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.370
He started, he's one of the three,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.810
and they even talked about one of the three

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.810
how he needed to recount.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.490
And I just recounted again today,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.970
and there's still only three listeners.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.390
So, done, done, Neil.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.130
Neil said, we need to recount?

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.850
Yeah, he said, surely there's more than three.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.690
I said, nope.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.690
And Neil also know that every time we count it's three,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.410
just let everyone know I recounted him.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.450
Thank you, all three listeners.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.610
We do appreciate it.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.530
I don't understand.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.570
I'm a data scientist.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.170
Like, it's three guys.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.530
Yeah, take it.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.130
Data science is magic.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.650
So if he says three, it's three.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.490
It's three.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.330
There's no other believable answer.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.480
Andrew's been listening since episode 30.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.070
Wow.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.350
But he did recommend the whole,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.190
he said, just go back to like 70,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.950
just watch the evolution of modern testing,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.870
and they really dive into the last one.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.070
It was a really nice, probably 60,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.310
he said 70, but 60.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.830
Some podcast hosts would go, just go listen to them all.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.630
I'm not gonna tell you that.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.170
I think you can start,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.470
you can do 60 forward is really good.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.110
And you can definitely go farther back.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.990
Which episode do you happen to recall which one

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.030
I give you the ISTQB questions?

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.030
Keep talking, I'll find it.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.030
Keep listening, you'll find the answer to that

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.870
if you wanna go back.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.710
It's a good episode.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.550
A lot of people like it.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.390
I think that's actually one of them

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.390
that I have actually managed to title.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.990
Yeah, but anyway, the point is,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.830
is a really nice plug for A-B testing

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.990
from both Neil and Andrew.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.030
We much appreciate it.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.190
We love to have new members of the three, so thank you.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.590
One other thing I did this week

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.550
is if you want to be part of the background discussion

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.610
and get early by two days releases

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.610
of the A-B testing podcast, you can join our Slack team.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.370
And to do that, you used to have to email me,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.910
but weirdly, more and more of the three

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.950
kept on emailing me and that got out of hand.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.910
So now you can just go to angryweasel.com,

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.750
whack A-B testing, and click on a link

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.150
on the right side and you'll get invited automatically.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.550
I can't not tell you how happy I am

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.390
that you figured that out.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.150
And try and tell me, try and tell me how happy you are.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.960
Oh, show me via an interpretive dance.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.900
And we're back!

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.740
Yeah, that was a little bit more than I was looking for.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.900
That was pretty happy.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.540
Oh, wow.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.350
Wow, oh, wow.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.470
What was it, IS?

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.870
No, what is the acronym?

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.750
You can't imagine what it's like to be in here, ISTQB.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.470
Do you need me to spell that for you?

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.950
Why is it QB?

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.350
Quality Board, International Software and Testing Quality

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.350
Board, I don't know what it stands for.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.110
I wonder if anyone does.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.170
I wonder if there's a name for an acronym

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.850
that no one knows what it stands for.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.220
Okay, so back to A-B testing.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.460
Hey, everybody.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.500
I hope you've enjoyed the show so far

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.780
because it's off to a roaring start here

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.900
where Brent tries to scroll and find titles on his phone.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.740
It's okay.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.580
It's okay.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.540
You can just send it to me later.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.380
We can do this.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.220
26.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.410
Episode 26 is where I ask Brent about giving some questions

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.010
from the ISTQB.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.810
There's some gems in there.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.610
We definitely got better as we went along.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.730
We definitely hit a roll, definitely starting with 60,

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.810
but probably before that, I think we actually had

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.450
some stuff under control.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.170
And then there was the episode I did,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.570
oh, without you, which was fun.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.410
And don't look up the number.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.250
Stop looking at your phone.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.090
Stop, stop, stop.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.690
I'm shutting it down.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.890
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.250
Oh, and then speaking of doing an episode without you,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.370
may or may not happen,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.620
I'm going to star East week after next.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.460
Congrats.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.300
I'll be back in time for the podcast.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.140
Don't worry.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.430
I'm not.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.270
All right.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.830
If I can fit it in, I'm only going for two days.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.310
Three days?

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.150
Whatever.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.190
I think I've gone three days.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.230
I'm gonna try and bring a little,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.870
see if I can bring some recording equipment,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.790
and maybe not do a podcast,

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.270
but it might be fun to interview some testers

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.760
about modern testing.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.720
It'll be interesting there because a lot of testers

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.520
are more on the newer side.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.560
I haven't figured it out.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.960
I may just sit in a corner and look at cat pictures.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.800
I'm not sure.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.720
That's interesting.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.520
Actually, we need to circle back with Joel as well,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.320
because I would have thought that we would have seen

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.000
the survey results for this year by now.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.840
Yeah.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.000
Oh, did we?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.960
I thought we did.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.890
Maybe we didn't.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.330
But your thoughts are-

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.370
A note for after the show,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.850
go see if those state of survey testing results came out,

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.970
because now that you mention it,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.730
I don't recall if they did come out.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.540
I'm fairly certain we would have done an episode on it.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.540
Your interview idea is what reminded me of that.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.500
Yeah, I think we should talk about what sort of questions.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.180
I think that could be,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.320
I think that's a very interesting concept.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.160
Okay.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.880
Shall we pretend to do a podcast?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.600
Hey, we're just about ready to get started with the podcast.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.840
Yeah.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.080
So I think it's,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.360
I love that you can,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.640
like most podcast listeners have that fast forward

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.640
30 second thing,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.600
which you can hit about five, six, 12 times

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.280
on any A.B. testing podcast,

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.400
if you still want to get right to us

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.640
actually talking about anything relevant to your job.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.640
I don't think that that's statistically provable.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.480
Okay, fine.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.320
And because-

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.880
I think there's probably a 70% chance

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.560
that no matter what you do with that thing,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.400
you're going to get to some random tangent.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.440
Because you're a data scientist,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.580
if it's data, I believe you.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.180
Okay, so we have a question

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.260
or a couple of questions to answer today.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Are these questions from-

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.740
We do not have questions.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.420
You lost the poll.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.750
Do it.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.100
Do it.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.660
Do we please have a,

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.040
wait, how many people voted

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.080
that I should do the Nickelodeon

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.650
copyrighted mailbag intro?

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.170
Don't look it up.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.890
I was just going to tease you about-

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.090
I'm gonna say 20 versus one, you.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.160
I guess there's one thing we've learned

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.400
in the last 18 months of American politics

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.080
is that lying is totally acceptable.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.710
And if you lie enough, it becomes the truth.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.800
Right.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.680
Not sure what I was talking about.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.650
This is not a political podcast.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.940
By unpopular demand.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.780
Mailbag!

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.620
Yes!

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.460
Okay.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.380
Yes, we do not have questions.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.780
We have mailbag items today.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.780
All right.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.020
You want to start with Patrick.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.420
So one thing, one bombshell we dropped

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.420
and worth some elaboration is,

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.220
if I remember correctly on the last episode,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.200
Brent asked me, is modern testing a role?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.200
I said, is there such a thing as a modern tester?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.440
And I said no.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.200
And it was a revelation, a slight revelation for me too,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.320
but I just needed that moment of reflection.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.160
Think no, it says modern testing is a way.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.000
Right.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.320
It's a, yeah, it's a air quote way.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.280
But I want to-

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.280
I'm actually glad Patrick, hey TestPappy, thanks.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.240
And then actually just to piggyback,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.000
and then I made a comment, like if it does exist,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.240
right, I don't have our principles numbers memorized,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.160
but if it does exist, one of our last principles

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.620
necessitates that it disappears.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.220
And I thought about it some more since then,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.060
and I'm glad you mentioned that,

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.580
because I think there is,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.700
a modern tester is the role that leads a team

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.100
towards modern testing.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.180
But then by definition, yeah, it is transitory.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.210
Right.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.530
I don't want to dive into the next question,

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.010
like thanks, Pepe, on to the next one.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.690
Because they do overlap a little bit.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.530
They do.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.150
But if you look at the, and I don't have this

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.310
in front of me, but there are three principles

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.670
called the ways of DevOps.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.510
You looked at these?

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.350
No.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.290
Brent will look at his phone right now,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.130
and look them up.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.970
No, no.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.810
But I don't have them in front of me,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.570
but they overlap, interestingly,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.370
quite a bit with modern testing principles.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.330
It doesn't.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.410
Shouldn't surprise.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.770
It doesn't surprise me.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.500
Like a lot of what modern testing is,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.580
in my view, is sort of a,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.100
it's a repackaging of a lot of existing principles.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.940
Absolutely.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.500
Susinctly, and then with a test skin.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.660
One of the things I ask,

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.540
well, a quality spin.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.580
What I view these principles are about,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:15.070
and how do we focus in,

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.230
and help the test community do their part

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:23.030
to stop being a cost to the business,

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.470
and shift to being a value add to the business.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.000
Yes.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.420
But with a heavy focus on their existing strengths,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.820
which are very quality focused.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.940
So many things to talk about.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.980
So let me go through the thoughts and order in my head,

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.400
which is a difficult thing.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.640
My last team at Microsoft.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.990
I, teams.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.810
As I've mentioned before, drink.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.770
I was brought in as the quality guy.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.010
The guy to influence quality,

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.340
basically the modern tester.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.100
I think that was near literally your title, wasn't it?

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.940
The quality guy.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.780
Yeah.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.340
Across a fairly large dev team.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.780
Once my manager put more and more burden on me

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.380
to own the quality,

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.300
or to be at least be the scapegoat for quality

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.140
in some ways,

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.940
responsible, everyone I put it.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.300
Which I didn't totally hate,

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.660
because I did feel like my role

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.820
was to mature the quality culture,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.980
to improve quality.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.190
But what I ended up realizing,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.510
sort of taking ownership of,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.310
or a green thick ownership of,

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.630
was basically everything from the developer desktop

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.470
to deployment.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.710
Everything from the dev teams

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.070
could take care of designing features.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.900
But once they started writing code,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.300
all the way until deployment was handed off

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.580
to our site reliability engineers.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.260
All that was under my team one way or the other.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.100
We were writing productivity tools for developers.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.060
We were writing gates for check-ins.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.300
We handled deployment.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.340
We handled bug tracking.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.060
We handled reports.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.740
We handled all of the compliance issues,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.340
everything in there.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.500
And then,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.740
and even for my last several months,

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.580
doing release management.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.980
Reviewing every change going in

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.660
and making sure the right changes were going in.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.500
Or the right work was going into the changes going in.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.740
Yeah, I remember all this,

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.660
but hearing you summit,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.500
I'm just,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.140
vomiting a little bit in my mouth.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.680
I'm just like.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.200
I wanna come back to that.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.120
I wanna know where the vomit comes from,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.960
other than your gut.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.280
Because to me it seems like

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.940
you're your last manager.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.140
And maybe it's innocuous,

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.580
but the way you just described it,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.940
like over time,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.660
every time you take one of these things,

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.820
you're sort of rebuilding up the,

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.060
I like how you put it, I use it a lot.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.090
Resolidifying your role as the team scapegoat.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.210
Right, if it doesn't ship fast enough,

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.050
whose fault is it?

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.890
Alan, if the quality's low,

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:01.810
whose fault is it?

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.650
Alan.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.170
And to be clear,

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.530
my last manager was a piece of crap.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.320
But honestly,

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.320
my last job was perfect for me at Microsoft

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.360
because I got to do a lot more,

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.880
I got to get a lot nicer view of end to end,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.080
that whole pipeline,

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.920
which I wanna come back to.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.960
I think it's very important.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.280
Everything from developer desktop to deployment.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.960
I got a good view of how all that works,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.520
what common pitfalls are,

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.180
I learned a lot.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.100
But also I had a bad enough experience

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.580
with team culture and management

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.870
that it put me in a job

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.740
that I'm a thousand times more happier in.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.100
Full, full, I got experience,

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.940
but also the right kick in the butt to get out.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.020
The universe prepared me

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.500
to go have a great time at Unity.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.860
So I'm, I'm,

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.700
There you go.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.590
I'm happy with the way things turned out.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.030
So I have a similar experience

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.910
between my current job and my last job.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.290
And, and as you know,

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.110
your current position,

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.110
you will always find something to,

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.150
to begin to really hate.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.830
But one of the things that I

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.070
currently fall back to

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.390
is I go,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.130
yes, but you know what?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.590
It's still not my last job.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.550
Yeah.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.730
Sometimes you need to have,

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.270
you know, a rough experience

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.190
to set that bar really low

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.390
so you,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.110
you can appreciate your current situation.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.430
It's all relative.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.430
One of the great learnings I got from that is I think

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.550
the modern tester looks at everything

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.630
from developer desktop all the way to deployment.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.230
That's their playground to find bottlenecks

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.750
and to find places for improvement,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.710
to find places where

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.140
the quality can be injected.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.140
Accelerating the achievement of simple quality

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.980
requires that you look at everything

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.020
from developer desktop all the way to deployment

00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.940
and figure out where,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.900
where the acceleration part or help can come in.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.740
Right.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.710
So let me tell you something that I'm working on

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.330
that's relevant to this, right?

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.750
Now I'm going to do it from a,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.870
a statistical or a machine learning point of view.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.070
Remember, remember listeners,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:21.040
that means it will be true.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.880
That,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.000
Okay, go on.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.840
Yeah.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.000
The,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.160
but the problem is,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.720
is relevant period.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.830
So here at,

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.670
at Microsoft we,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.750
much like any other place that has a service,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.590
we have,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.010
we have a DevOps type of thing.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.750
And we have these,

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.970
I'll just call them things called outages.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.730
And an outage is,

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.130
Hey, suddenly we stopped providing service

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.770
that we have promised to customers.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.610
Right.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.800
You can imagine,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.640
you know,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.120
a big outage would be a whole data center going down

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.320
due to like a power situation.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.420
Okay.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:12.580
One of the things that I am deeply involved in is

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.660
the,

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.980
the measurement of success

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.980
and the process by which we get all of the developer leaders

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.260
in a room and work through,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.680
how do we make this stop happening?

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.520
Okay.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.120
It's a very expensive meeting.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.760
It happens every week.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.220
It's an hour and a half.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.060
And now,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.700
now I have a little VOD coming up in my throat.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.180
Yeah.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.020
Well,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.200
and so good.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.060
Rightfully so.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.720
Very expensive meeting hour and a half.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.950
You've got partners and VPs in this room.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.930
And what I've observed is a lot of the times it's,

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.170
it's regressing down to,

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.090
very simple suggestions.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.010
So this meeting,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.360
we have a lot of high power.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.620
And what I've now concluded is we really don't know,

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:13.280
there's a process that those above us have pushed on,

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.400
pushed even down onto the VPs.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.280
But no one's really evaluating,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.940
is this process having an effect?

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.940
Are we getting the value from the investment?

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.780
Right.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.060
So one of the problems is like outages,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.360
a big part of the outage problem is human error.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.640
Someone's trying to do something.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.960
They did a typo.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.440
Instead of doing what they intended to do,

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.300
they had an unexpected consequence and something else.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.220
And now they've created another outage.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.360
This actually happens.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.000
Yeah, Phil, I've experienced many of those.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.930
But all of these are sort of one-offs.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:55.770
Right?

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.610
And so,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.160
what I'm trying to work through

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.440
is do we even need this meeting?

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.280
Right?

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.680
It's a very expensive meeting.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.800
And are these suggestions actually adding value?

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.080
So what I'm now gonna try to do,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.900
and it's a difficult data science problem

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.740
because it,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.740
data science as you know,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.840
works better when you have multiple data points.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.360
These are all one-offs.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.730
But that type of analysis and that type of quality check,

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.290
one of the things that I'm actually looking to do is say,

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.650
hey, maybe we don't need to optimize this process,

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.210
or rather what we need to do is optimize this process

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.170
by removing it, right?

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.510
And coming up with something else.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.510
My current theme, every year it seems like I have a theme

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.190
in the team.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.770
You should have a theme song too.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.670
You should work on that.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.220
All right.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.380
But my theme last year, for example,

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.220
was Cosmos is dead.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.700
So for the uninitialized,

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.820
Cosmos is the massive data lake used for storing

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.340
all kinds of crap at Microsoft.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.180
Yes.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.860
And it's slow and has low reliability.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.020
And another fine team in Israel has created for us

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.780
a much better solution.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.700
Now Cosmos, so we do have a...

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.080
Is it called Cosmos 2 Business Edition?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.320
No, we do have a...

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.440
We do, and this is one thing I also don't understand,

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.420
but we do have an official branded product called Cosmos DB.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.810
This is not the thing I'm referring to.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.700
The theme this year is around,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:58.690
essentially, how do we automate away the human?

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.010
Now don't take that out of context,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.990
you context-driven people.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.110
It's in some cases, automating away the human

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.790
is the right thing to do.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.980
What cases is it not?

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.240
To the CDT people?

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.450
I don't wanna make...

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.530
Oh, you're talking about the...

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.690
Automation is replacing the job of the human tester.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.490
Testing is a sapient process

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.810
requiring thinking and creativity.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.570
Yes, agreed.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.850
Get over it, move on.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.690
Fine.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.510
Fine.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.650
Anyway, sorry for the tangent,

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.330
but I have to play devil's advocate voice.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.170
What I am trying...

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:36.130
Voice of the prick.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.610
What I am trying to do in this particular case

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:44.000
is create a system that learns from the human,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.560
but then automates the decision-making process

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.040
because as we scale up,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.120
and I did a presentation to Alan a few months ago,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.980
and one of the things that I was able to show

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.760
is Azure is massively growing.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.650
Don't believe you.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.490
Fine.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.750
Financial reports coming out very soon.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.030
Read that, believe that.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.340
Just full disclosure,

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.330
my team's data feeds into the financial disclosure.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.250
So if it's wrong, you're fired.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.170
Yeah, but I'm a data scientist.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.010
So it must be true.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:18.830
Right.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:19.670
Gotcha.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.500
Nevermind.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.260
Anyway, so the point I'm trying to...

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.140
Yeah, but what is the point you're trying to make?

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:31.020
So just analyzing that process

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.380
and accelerating isn't...

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.740
Like it says accelerating

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.180
the achievement of shippable quality.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.900
Just remember, it's not just about...

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.260
Just because that's the first word

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.440
doesn't mean it's the most important.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.280
Right?

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.480
That there's also of,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.760
okay, how do we achieve the goal of shippable quality?

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.680
And then in my view,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.120
the MT principles or the modern testing principles

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.480
should feed into that.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.920
Sometimes the right thing to do is say,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.880
this process is stupid, get rid of it.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.300
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.320
It's the systems thinking aspect.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.640
Talk about bringing our strengths to the table

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.680
to help the team transition to a modern testing way.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.300
Part of that is just looking at the system as a whole.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.960
A lot of people can work for years successfully

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.680
as a developer by only seeing their part of the system.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.440
It's up to us as people driving modern testing

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.120
to view that whole system and...

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.600
Measure it against the end goal.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.080
I can't tell you,

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.240
back when I wore the title test manager,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.180
one of the things that I realized all the time.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.560
And I then started measuring,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.560
and it really did start to sicken me.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.760
Where, right, dev would find this clever thing

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.980
that shortened the dev schedule.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:01.460
And they would be praised and held up as heroes.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.460
But that same thing that they did

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.860
added three weeks to the test schedule.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.420
Yeah.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:13.420
And so there was this sort of component level optimization

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.380
instead of optimizing the whole system.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.460
I'm like, look, your stupid decision

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.060
actually changed the schedule by a whole,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.680
extended the schedule by a week.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.980
This was a bad call, not a good call.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.540
Why are we rewarding this guy?

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.300
Right.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.060
Lean talks about optimize the whole.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.580
The whole process, not a subcomponent.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.620
Because it is absolutely not true.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.900
I think we're saying the same thing.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.740
Yeah.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.140
If the processes are independent,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.420
yeah, you can go component by component.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.140
And optimize that individually.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.660
But if a decision from an upstream process

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.260
could negatively impact the one downstream,

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.580
then you need to go after the whole system.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.980
That's still a theory of constraints.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.130
Yes.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.460
I want to make sure we have time

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.620
to talk about the next question.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.440
Go ahead.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.900
I think to wrap up,

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.420
I think it's something we'll discuss more.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.100
I think if questions come up around

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.020
this transitional process and modern testing

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.900
being a way versus a role.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.700
Because I see the modern tester really

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.320
as the person who facilitates the transition

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.320
into a team doing the modern testing principle.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.900
I think the modern tester is transitional.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.740
I think his primary role is to be a leader

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.180
and an example that others follow

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.340
to get the rest of the team aboard.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.700
Put a pin in the leader part.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.220
And then this next mailbag question,

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.300
I only need to do it once per episode,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.660
was actually a direct message on Twitter

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.860
and from a month ago, so I'm so sorry.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.880
But we're getting to it.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.460
From Just Voskul.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.700
I think it's probably Just.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.340
Just, Just Voskul.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.010
Yeah, because the J's are wise.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.290
Scandinavia.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.610
Yeah, he sent a DM.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.050
Which I shared with Brent.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:05.970
Yep, and I will say.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.450
I probably broke a European privacy law.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.670
TLDR, we're not gonna go through the whole thing on this.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.410
It's very smart mail.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.090
It's not a mail, it's a tweet.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:16.930
DM.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:17.770
DM, sure.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:21.460
So a couple points we wanted to cover in this.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.420
Let me start with, I got the last question.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:28.060
So one of the things that he had an issue with

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.200
was us saying we want you to focus on quality

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.900
and not code correctness.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.580
Yeah, what do you mean by that, Brent?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.140
And then he asks if we are responsible

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.420
for the quality culture, it's quality

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.860
and then he concludes it's quality in the widest form,

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.780
including code quality maintainability.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.380
Maybe I'm missing the point there, can we elaborate?

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.560
Yeah, we can elaborate.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.480
We can.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.960
If nothing else about this podcast.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.680
That's one thing we know how to do is elaborate.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.680
We can elaborate.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.120
Please elaborate.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.200
I'll tell you my perspective on this.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.840
As part of the transition I think is absolutely critical

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:12.250
that tests get away from any semblance

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.610
of what we've called the dysfunctional loop.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.490
There is a more positive way of describing this

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:24.480
and perhaps you'll get to it as well.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.220
But one of the behaviors we have to get rid of

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.520
is any semblance of the scapegoating

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.980
that it is test job to find these bugs.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.100
Yes.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.340
Dev gets to write the bugs and test gets to find them.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.780
Which might be-

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.860
A lot of vomit in the back of the throat.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.820
I mean, there's some places where it is fun.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:52.820
The Easter time, the Easter bunny goes and hides all the eggs

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.880
and then we have to go and find them.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.780
But in this particular case,

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.460
the Easter bunny doesn't come and slaughter those

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.020
who didn't find enough eggs.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.500
No, what we wanna do to actually move quality upstream

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.100
is we have to get rid of that safety net and say,

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:16.900
no, on code correctness, Dev, you're wholly responsible.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.260
Now-

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.280
And to be clear, Interject,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.960
I look at from the Agile quadrants.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.320
Of course, modern testing principles

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.120
are based largely on Agile testing.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.000
Brian Merrick's Agile testing quadrants,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.760
which were elaborated on quite a bit

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.080
by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory and then others,

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.920
are a good model to look at

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.560
to understand the holistic view of testing.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.440
And there is code correctness in the quadrants,

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.240
but if, I could look at it two ways,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.850
let me finish both for you, Interject.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.050
One, I could say a team where the team

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.570
I could say a team where the Dev team doesn't own

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.750
or won't take ownership for code correctness

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.970
isn't ready for modern testing.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.570
Or alternate view is the first thing

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.050
that a modern tester,

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.230
someone helping with transition should do

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.450
is make sure and coach the team

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.490
and give them the tools and information they need

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.690
to help own their own code correctness.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.330
I'm gonna push back on your first comment

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.210
because yeah, they're not ready,

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.370
but they absolutely need to become ready.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.730
Yeah, which is kinda led into the second one,

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:17.970
which if you're going to,

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.690
if you do want to evolve and be able to

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.810
stay in business, frankly,

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.370
you're going to need to transition

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.170
to something towards modern testing.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.130
I actually think we, the last episode,

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.410
we talked about my tourniquet metaphor.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.250
Yes.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.070
Right?

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.850
And I think if you find that the Dev team

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.410
is not willing to do this,

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:44.300
I actually think that is a viable place to rip the band-aid.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.300
Because your other choice is to let it persist.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.860
Famously, and I say famously because I saved the screenshot

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.380
and had it even in my test bash talk

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.840
was the headline Yahoo Eliminates the Safety Net

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.300
to improve and to improve code quality

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.780
or to improve quality.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.900
I forget the exact quote,

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.160
but it was the article from when they

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.660
got rid of all their testers

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.100
and figured, well, automatically now,

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.440
because people don't have testers,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.970
they will automatically own quality.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.860
And that case, it was a tourniquet.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.010
I think, could be either.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:24.830
Yep.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.170
Where I think, and the way I'm driving modern testing

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:31.890
at Unity is, and the thing I learned from my last two teams

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.930
at Microsoft where we did transition

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.930
to Dev teams owning end-to-end quality, more or less,

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.410
was my big takeaway is that a transition is needed

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.410
and modern testers and coaches are needed

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.890
to help the team get there.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.790
It won't happen automatically if you get rid of testers.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.410
That's the biggest mistake I see teams moving

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.610
to unified engineering do, is think,

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.450
okay, nobody's a tester anymore, it'll all work out.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.970
You need someone to manage the transition.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:01.810
Oh, oh, oh.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:02.650
Or to lead the transition.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.240
The only way where I've seen it actually work

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.240
is in that regard is you actually eliminate the testers.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.060
Because you've visibly gotten rid of the safety net.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.760
I remember when Microsoft first started doing this,

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.760
we tried to come up with a way to sort of ease the balance.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.560
And I remember one team, they had a 10 to one,

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.880
they went from a one to one Dev to test ratio

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.600
to a 10 to one Dev to test ratio.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.600
And they just ended up with a really busy tester, right?

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.440
Yeah, actually, I think they did.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.600
Yeah, actually, no, and this is the reason why,

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.520
this gets back to why I am so focused on,

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.280
no, get out of the code correctness game,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.440
because your Dev are meant,

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.640
they have this mental muscle memory,

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.740
and it is hard to get them out of the frame

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.540
that they own their code correctness.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.540
And I was actually in, I was having lunch,

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.140
and I was with a Dev and a test,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.980
and the Dev looked over at the test guy,

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.340
who was the one and the 10, looked over at the test guy,

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.300
and I was like, I don't understand what leadership is doing.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.130
How are you going to do all this?

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:28.730
And I looked at him, I'm like, he's not, you are.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.540
It requires leadership because they didn't know that.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.940
Just remember, because we're going through

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:35.980
a little bit of this,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.380
I'm not going to dive into details,

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.780
but the main point it reminds me of is,

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.620
Google had this thing called test ready,

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.620
which meant, until you can show that you've done everything,

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.260
and some pretty high levels around code correctness,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.140
don't even ask for any help from testing experts.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.100
Because you need to show that you can

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.900
take care of yourself first.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.930
I agree with that.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:03.930
I think at Microsoft,

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.130
There's something to that.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.250
I think at Microsoft,

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:07.970
I've seen things similar to that,

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.810
and in different names, I think at Microsoft,

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.010
what would happen is we would find

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:18.010
that the developers would set their test ready bar too low.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.750
The thing that I would say on this one is,

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.790
number one, QA's new value proposition

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.630
is around the measurement of quality.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.070
One of the things that I would do in Xbox, for example,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.830
this is the last time I remember doing this,

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.310
I'm like, we are spending 300 million, not 300 million,

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.830
but there was one feature that we spent

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.340
actually a million dollars on.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.940
And I'm like, why?

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.340
What evidence do we have that anyone's going to use this?

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.540
Turns out I was right,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.860
and after we had spent the whole million dollars,

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.940
the feature got cut,

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.020
because it relied on a super niche market.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.060
And I'm like, we need to get some venture capitalists

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.980
into some of these decision-making positions,

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:10.270
because when it's their money versus Microsoft's money,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.270
people are making smarter decisions.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.050
On the code correctness,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.690
modern testers job is essentially,

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.210
no, we're here to teach others to fish, okay?

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.170
So I think the main point to get across

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.610
is that it's not that we don't care about code correctness,

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.210
it's absolutely important,

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:36.210
but it's, we can't lead modern testing,

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.010
we can't scale if,

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.070
and a team essentially can't achieve

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.130
accelerating the achievable quality

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.890
without a dev team that really understands

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.410
and owns code correctness.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.770
I've actually gotten to the point

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.770
where I've realized that the only way to get tests

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:59.340
to realize that their role is to teach others to fish

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.780
is to make it hard for them to give fish,

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.580
because once that starts,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.280
you're inviting the dysfunction loop again.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.280
So that in a nutshell,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.880
as we have enough more people,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.370
the right balances will be struck.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.190
But right now, I don't think that's the current

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.270
shape of the world.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.270
Yeah.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.390
Just say no.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.030
So one thing,

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.550
I can't remember if you just had a question

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.550
about this directly,

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.750
or what the exact question was,

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.590
and you can look it up while I talk,

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.430
is the leadership aspect of this,

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:38.110
the leadership needed for a person functioning

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.260
in the modern testing role.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.340
It's become, as I've thought about it more and more,

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:47.080
and as I've looked at the people in my team

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.980
who are leading their teams towards this,

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.060
these, towards these principles, towards this way,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.320
I realize it's almost entirely a leadership issue

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.120
and entirely dependent on their ability

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.360
to grow as leaders.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.440
It's not entirely.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.680
I mean, the transition,

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.680
like if you don't have influencing skills,

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.600
if there are multiple ways,

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.240
it's one of the reasons why I say,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.060
hey, you need analytical skills.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.120
Because a lot of times,

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.520
if you personally don't have the soft skills to influence,

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.120
if I'm gonna build a model,

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.480
a triangle pyramid, whatever,

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.120
I won't go into the tangent there.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.440
I think the basis is,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.480
you mentioned it before, you have to have influence skills.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.680
The basis is leadership.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.600
Everything else builds on top of that.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.000
If people don't wanna do what you say,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.120
or people don't see your value,

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.480
or people don't agree with the direction

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.310
you're trying to go in, good luck.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.910
It's gonna be very difficult.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.150
Well, no, it's not good luck.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:56.150
Go read a book on the topic.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.550
Pick three things from that that resonate, try them.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.910
And if this still doesn't work, go get a different book.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.510
Like, don't give up.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.910
Never surrender.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.270
Just like testing where we try new things all the time,

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.190
as a leader, and not as a manager,

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.590
as a leader, well, as a manager too,

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.110
but in this case, talking about leadership,

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.670
you need to constantly try out new things.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.910
If you keep on trying the same thing over and over,

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:21.550
like, well, I asked them to do it,

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:22.550
and they didn't do it.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.870
Well, I asked them to do it, and they didn't do it.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.830
Well, I asked them, it's like,

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.790
dude, you suck, or I guess Brent says go read a book.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.510
But seriously, you need to, it is hard.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.710
Leadership is, effective leadership is just as hard,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.070
or harder than any of the technical stuff

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.750
that we do as testers.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.710
You also have to have a little bravery, I think.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.980
I was thinking about the tourniquet stuff.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.140
I remember at one point in time,

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.900
I made a decision of, you know what?

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.860
Yeah, I got a lot of testers,

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.610
but the nice thing is they're my testers,

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.650
not yours, Mr. Dev Guy.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:06.710
So here's the deal.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.780
I basically invented something similar

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.480
to what you talked about with Google,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.940
and I said, yeah, we're not available to you.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.420
But what about Check-in?

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.860
Yeah, what about Check-in?

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.280
And I remember one time,

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.860
Devleed came to me after I'd done this,

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.260
and she's like, why wasn't this found before?

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.260
And I'm like, well, if you wanna set up a meeting,

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.820
I'm happy to sit down and look through your unit tests

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.700
and help you answer that question.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.600
And she looked at me like, what?

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.440
I'm like, yeah, I'm here to help.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.640
Yeah, there's a, right?

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.760
She was already pissed when she came to my office.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.640
That one comment just blew her over.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.040
I'm like, I don't know how to make it more clear.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.040
I can't help those that can't help themselves.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.540
Right, right.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.800
I didn't make up that quote,

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.140
but it's very applicable here.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.160
I don't know where it came from,

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.920
but we can help those who can help themselves.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.120
But that actually started changing her world,

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.800
because what she did is she did what she has always done

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:25.020
when she's getting heat post-ship for a bug.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.780
But what we have to be able to do as modern testers

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.180
is be able to drive that behavior and quality

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.810
before the crisis comes, before the bad bug comes.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:36.730
Right, we can't wait till, okay,

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.570
we'll just wait till they fail badly.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.930
No, that's ideal, that's ideal,

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.570
but it's those crisis things

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.970
where the principles are tested.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.370
Yes.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:48.220
And what I did is I said,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.340
wow, that's a really crappy situation.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.740
And here's a person attacking me as if I'm responsible

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.170
but I'm not.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:04.170
She wrote the code and so now I'm gonna ignore her emotion.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.490
I'm gonna use this as an opportunity

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:11.310
to redirect her effort towards something that's productive.

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.230
Yeah, I'm happy to, you know what?

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.110
I am a test expert.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.050
Let's sit down, I'll set up a meeting tomorrow.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.590
Let's sit down, look at your test

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.790
and figure out the answer to her question.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.390
Now, what really pissed her off

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.350
is because she was hoping to use me as a story

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.350
for it was Brent's fault,

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:32.870
but I had already covered all of those bases.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:35.250
Let me talk about how maybe it could be proactive there.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.190
Let's say you're working with a team and they have,

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:40.550
you know from looking at data,

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:42.670
you're looking around the teams you work with

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.110
because a lot of times the modern tester

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.790
is working with multiple teams.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.270
There's the quality coach for multiple teams

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.030
and you look at a team that from the unit test

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.150
has like 25% code coverage.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.990
You could be proactive there and just say,

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:01.030
hey Devlead, looking through my data across the team,

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.350
I see your unit tests only have 25% code coverage.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.510
Can we set up a half hour, an hour to kind of walk through

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:11.670
and figure out what the plan is to get the code coverage up?

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.150
That's an A approach.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.590
So, and again, I need to preface this by saying

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.380
code coverage is a wonderful tool, but a horrible metric.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.220
You know what I mean?

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.040
I do.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:22.880
All right, now so go on.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.720
That's one way, but.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.120
Anyway, what I actually, so my version of that same question

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.760
is, hey can we set up a meeting?

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.120
And I'd like to understand why you don't view that as a risk.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.900
So what I'm trying to do is,

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.540
because what I don't want to do is get them to think that,

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.280
okay, I am the guy, I'm God in the ivory tower

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.420
and I will happen to look down and say,

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.240
your magic statistic is too low.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.840
No, because I want them to own it.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.680
Like, hey, did you consider this?

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.430
Why don't you view this as a risk?

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.930
And, because generally that will just be a conversation

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:10.940
and it'll end up being, okay, this is a risk.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.860
So I like taking the Socratic method on that.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.440
But it may not, I mean, again, it's a leadership is,

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.350
a lot of leadership is just initially, especially,

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.550
is forging these relationships.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.150
You have to have a relationship where we can have

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:25.770
a frank and honest conversation about it.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:30.370
Because it may be, well yeah, but my manager is

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.350
really pushing us to get these features out.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.550
So getting those out is more important

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:35.450
than reducing risk right now.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:38.970
And then the other thing actually both of our examples

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:44.260
help with is teaching that dev leader,

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:49.790
hey, there is a way to measure this.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.830
There is a way to have a coaching conversation

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:57.850
around whether or not you're too low or at risk.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:02.290
And I think also, and I brought that up as an example,

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:05.610
but really I'd want to have a more holistic conversation.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.510
It's like, hey, can we talk about quality for an hour?

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.130
And I'm gonna come in with, what are your quality goals?

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.450
And if we can establish some quality goals together,

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:13.370
how are we gonna get there?

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.130
And co-coverage can come up and risk

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:17.370
can come up as part of that.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:21.760
Could also be other risks in the pipeline.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.420
Again, looking at everything from developer desktop

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.280
to deployment, what are some other risks,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.060
what are some other things we want to do to improve quality?

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.260
How are we gonna do that and balance the new feature work?

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.260
What's important for the customer?

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.020
How are we going to measure things?

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.400
The only thing you're missing so far

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.220
is what's important to them.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.220
Because one of the things I've actually discovered

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:44.430
if you go, okay, no dev team has enough engineering hours.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:45.270
That's just great.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.110
That is absolutely true.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:49.230
Remember the data scientist said that, so it's true.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:54.230
So how do you use what they care about

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:01.700
and help them to remove some of these brute force methods?

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.820
Right, why do they not want to do unit testing?

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.240
Because the value's not immediately clear to them.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.560
They need a way to connect the dots.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.180
And it steals their engineering hours

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:17.250
because there's this belief that feature development

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:21.070
is what builds business value, which it does,

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.230
but then there's more to that.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.230
Like my favorite example, you've heard it from me

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.910
a million times before, perfect code that no one uses

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:33.430
is lower quality than buggy code that everyone uses.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.530
Striking that balance and getting trust

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.690
and getting the guy going, no, look,

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:44.910
I'm not stopping being your test guy

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.430
because of anything with you.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.350
It's because the system is broken

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:52.960
and I'm a part of that broken system.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.040
Me, this handoff between dev and test.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.920
No handoffs.

00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.760
No.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.330
I would say no handoffs to operations either.

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:05.360
I don't like handoffs.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.380
Yeah, that's a different topic for a different episode.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.640
Different topic for a different episode.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.020
So I think there's a lot more to talk about there.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:17.020
I do think that leadership and developing leadership skills

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.890
and doing that via forging relationships

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.010
versus asking someone for a top-down mandate

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.890
is the absolute basis for establishing

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:29.570
any sort of modern testing.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:32.170
I think we're gonna go into more detail

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:33.650
on each of the principles.

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:36.290
Do you wanna start that next episode?

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:37.130
Yeah.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.970
Okay.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:38.810
So why don't we?

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:40.770
One of the things that I'm saying,

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:45.240
like leadership is a foundational basis of this.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.720
So we'll go into more depth on this topic

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.560
as we go through the principles.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.400
We will.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.180
So just for those planning their listening schedule,

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.400
one of the things Brent and I have been talking about doing

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.520
and I think we'll be ready to start it

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.560
with the next episode is we'll spend an episode each

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.040
on each of the modern testing principles.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.240
Maybe two.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.440
We'll see how things go.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.680
Yeah.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.920
And just diving deep with a normal amount of tangents

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.060
and fitting in some mailbags as needed.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.160
But one to explain to the listeners,

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.280
as anyone who's been listening to the last 10 or more

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:21.280
episodes, 20 knows, modern testing is evolving.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.940
We flush out a lot of our beliefs on modern testing

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.800
as we record the podcast.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.640
So I think that's what we do.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.400
We do as well as through the mailbags and questions.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.920
So keep the mailbags coming,

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.560
join the Slack channel, post questions there.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.200
The Slack channel is actually something

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.780
that I'm extremely fond of because now

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.880
people will post a question

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:48.040
and some other member of the three will respond

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.920
and I actually like a lot of these responses.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.240
It's grown into a self-sustaining community.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.080
It is, yeah.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.580
Which as a community leader is the ultimate goal.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:59.900
So very proud of that.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.520
Thanks Perzy for setting that up.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.080
And thank you all three listeners

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.440
for hanging out there and having the conversations.

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.880
Okay, we're out of time or more.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.720
I'm Alan.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.540
I'm Brent.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.380
We'll see you next time.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.220
Bye.
