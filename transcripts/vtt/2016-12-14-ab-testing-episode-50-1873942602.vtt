WEBVTT

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.940
I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we are here for episode 50.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.260
50. Five zero.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.820
Sequenta. The golden anniversary. Brent, I got you a present.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.500
Did you? No. Yeah.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340
By the way, before we go on, thinking of presents, like...

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.460
Why would we go on? You couldn't have even gotten me coffee.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.300
Like what the hell? How do you work in this building with a broken coffee machine?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.100
I use my little itty bitty legs and I go up the stairs where they have two coffee machines.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.300
That's a good solution. Yeah.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.660
Except for the whole going upstairs.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.980
I'll tell you what. The B and AB testing is not for brains.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.740
It is also not for burning unnecessary calories.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.780
So...

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.660
So, did you ever think, once upon a time, years ago,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.740
Brent and I would give each other crap in these test architect group meetings,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.820
which really kind of sort of touch wine fests and...

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.740
Which was really the start of this.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.420
It was like Michael Hunter or somebody said,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780
you guys should record your conversations.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.220
Said, yeah, we'll do a podcast.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.380
Those were amusing.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.460
And then we started one and then we...

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.750
And we still have one.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.790
So, let's get going.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.790
One comment we had after the last podcast, which was episode 49.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.110
That was essentially Debbie TF on the TLAs.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.670
Yeah, Debbie TF on the TLAs.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.710
TLAs, those three letter acronyms, those abbreviations that every corporation flies around.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710
One, I don't know if you changed jobs.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.550
It's been a couple of years now.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.990
But whenever you go to a new job, people start talking and they all understand each other.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.630
And you go, what the heck are they talking about?

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.750
It took me a good three months on the current job to get up to speed on the TLAs.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.070
Yeah, and sometimes...

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.230
Now I'm generating them.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.510
It gets a little ridiculous.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.270
So, let's see if we can remember all the ones we talked about.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.270
So, we mentioned SRE.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.150
Yes, Service Reliability and Engineering Team.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.980
Typically, Site Reliability Engineer,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.780
which is what the term came from, the role was invented at Google, where they call it a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.220
Site Reliability Engineer.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.820
And actually, I can really recommend Google's book on Site Reliability Engineering.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.300
That's the name of the title.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.900
I'll have to ask...

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.500
I say the name of the title.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.010
That's the name of the book, the title of the book.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.960
It's a good book.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.720
I have to ask my SRE team what he calls the S.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.680
Yeah.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.560
Pretty sure it was Service Reliability.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.760
That's the problem with TLAs, is they can morph, right?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.040
You know, the thing is, they can morph.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.240
Like WTF is...

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.080
But in this case...

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.840
It could mean what the fudge or where's the fire.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.560
Windows Test Framework.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.080
Yes, exactly.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.400
If I would have written it or if James Woodaker wrote in that book would have been called

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.220
How We Do Site Reliability Engineering at Google, but you know.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.900
Yeah, I have no clue.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.140
You have to speed on what James is doing, Lillian.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.060
James is a professional talker to peopleer.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.060
Yes, I know that.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.060
That's pretty much it.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.060
I had lunch with him last year.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.060
Once a year he writes...

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.860
He starts doing PR for a new thing of how to be awesome.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.860
What ifs.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.860
What ifs.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.180
He's being James.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.180
Yes.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.780
Another acronym we threw out.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.780
What's another one we...

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.260
There were DevOps, there were TSGs.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.620
Okay, DevOps is...

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.620
DevOps is pretty...

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.220
It's not really a TLA, it's just an abbreviation.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.260
I thought DevOps is pretty well known.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.430
You can search that one.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.750
TSGs, troubleshooting guides.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.030
I actually listened to them episode and put it on the Slack channel.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.030
DRI.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.790
DRI, designated responsible individual.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.550
Which is a dumb acronym, but it's caught on at Microsoft.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.190
It's the guy that answers the phone when the site goes down.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.950
Yeah, it's interesting though.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.830
Someone says DRI and no one calls it the DRI.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.630
Anyway.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.630
That's not interesting.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.690
It is to me.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.770
Usually when you pronounce an acronym people say crap.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.770
Oh, GA.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.650
Our product will go into GA sometime next year and that's general availability.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.880
We used to call that RTM, but it's...

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.240
We don't really release to manufacturing anymore.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.520
They called it RTW, released to web for a while, but now GA, the term is like, it's

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520
available.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.830
You can use it.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.300
All right then.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.300
Any others?

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.070
Did we get them all?

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.750
Yeah, I'm sure people will tell us if we have them.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.750
I know.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.830
I'm sure we'll fire a few out here.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.830
So we had...

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.870
Is this a mail bed question?

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.870
Essentially.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.190
So on the Slack channel, so the next topic...

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.190
What the f***?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.020
Mail bed!

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.950
Now you can go on.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.860
All right.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.300
Man, you are just making your editing job so much harder this episode.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.620
You know what?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.430
You would not believe how hard it is.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.110
Have you automated the scanning of the use of F words?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.990
No, but me dropping a few F bombs is nothing like editing out your coffee slurping and

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.010
sniffling and coughing and microphone fondling.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.030
You're not warmed up yet.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.470
Brent is now eyeing his microphone stand seductively.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.030
Whoa, Mikey.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.060
Hey baby.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.380
All right.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.380
Can we go into the topic?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.380
I've been waiting.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.540
All right.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.140
Salty Gunner and H.E. Gold.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.140
Henry, I believe.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.140
Yeah.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.140
Yeah.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:27.300
One of the topics that resonated with them on episode 49 is essentially your rant on

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.570
your PMs asking you, hey, when are we going to ship?

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.570
When are we going to ship?

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.570
When are we going to ship?

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:42.130
And the sense that only the front end shipping is the only thing that matters.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.320
And it occurred to me, and I wrote it in the Slack channel, I'm like, oh, crap, I was too

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:57.970
busy joining Alan in the man PMs or stupid party.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.690
And realize that, no, there's actually, there is a solution.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.320
It's not simple because it's a system problem, but there's a solution.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.000
And I said, okay, well, we can certainly attempt to talk to that on episode 50.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.600
Well, talk about your solution and I'll talk about mine when I feel like interrupting you.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.110
Okay.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.110
All right.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:28.940
So first and foremost, why are the PMs all hot and bothered about shipping the experience?

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.620
Is that a rhetorical question?

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.340
Like me to answer, go ahead and answer.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.380
He was expecting the answer rhetorical.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.020
I was expecting rhetorical.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.360
There's in general, it's because it's visible.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.120
It's that, and I'll go ahead and go into my part of the answer here is there's a

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.800
nice, I like quadrants and diagrams.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:08:00.440
There's a quadrant of visible and invisible and features and bugs or, or we'll call it

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.200
bugs for now, but you have visible features.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.200
That's, you can see it.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.440
It gives me new value.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.280
It's really cool.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.480
You also have visible bugs.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.920
Oh, this doesn't work right.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.480
Then on the other side of the quadrant, you have invisible features, which are

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.000
architecture and things underneath and how you do your protocol handling, et cetera.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.000
And then this whole pile in the corner of, uh, and actually, actually the services are

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.560
kind of there too.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.800
They're not visible features.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.360
They're super important, but they're not visible.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.240
And then in that bottom corner where you have invisible, uh, bugs is just where

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.240
your tech debt lives.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:35.730
Right.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.690
So, uh, but this is all an engineering perspective.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.330
What about from a customer perspective?

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:48.050
Customers don't care whether you have two services or 12 services or 150

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.690
services, they want their pretty little UI to work.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.080
More importantly, they want their problem solved.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.280
Like, and if the pretty UI doesn't solve their problems, then they're not

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.400
going to use the pretty UI.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.320
You are correct.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.640
Right.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:08.180
The, um, for once the quality from a customer point of view, it's, it's as,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.480
as all of our listeners are well aware is, is multifaceted.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.160
Um, but first and foremost, customers want their problems solved.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.990
Right.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.350
We were talking about teams, right?

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:30.830
What's some of the, what's the number one hypothesis for, for a customer

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:31.990
solution for teams?

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.580
Rephrase your question in the form of a question I understand.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.900
What problems does team solve for customers?

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.260
Uh, team collaboration.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.480
Okay.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.560
Or team digital collaboration.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.320
Right.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.930
Your product is an experiential product.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:56.690
Correct.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.250
Right.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:04.010
It is not like a SQL server or any actual server product where, where the

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.050
architecture itself is the solution to the problem.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:13.010
The architecture in your case is an implementation towards a problem solution.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:13.210
Sure.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.730
Right.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:21.580
Um, in a nutshell, why PMs are all hot and bothered about this is because

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.820
it's the experience that settles the product.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.620
No, I agree.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:25.980
Right.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:32.120
Now, the other thing that was talked about a lot in the Slack channel is,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.200
Hey, uh, they're cramming in a bunch of features.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.480
Uh, the architecture can't stand that up.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.420
Right.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.060
We have six months.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.300
I'm now making up stuff, but we have, we have six months of work to put

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:52.780
into our back in order to be able to handle the scale for, um, the front end.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:53.540
Right.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:01.020
And it's when I saw that, that, that longterm thinking around what the

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.340
plans were for the backend in the hypothetical example on, on the

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:13.940
Slack channel, I realized, Oh crap, this is a be def big design up front.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:23.940
What appears to be super common is still, uh, to design your architectures with a big

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.860
design up front with the architectural layering model.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.980
And what doesn't appear to be common yet is sort of how to adapt the system.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.880
Uh, the system of developing product so that you're delivering vertical

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.120
slices, uh, in an emergent design fashion.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.140
You are correct in the general sense.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.860
There are other dynamics on our team that for job preservation, I won't go into,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.860
but in general, that's why these things, that's why these views come this way.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.180
Yes.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:58.620
Yeah.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.060
So it takes a lot of effort.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:11.860
I like, uh, the, there's two real good sources, uh, combined together that really,

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.830
uh, help people understand the direction.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.190
It's a system problem.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:23.830
So, so there's no real magical do this and, and that stuff happens.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:30.690
Um, but if you, if you look at Eric Reese's book, something we've talked about a lot

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:37.570
here, we have as well as, um, pretty much anything from the pop and dikes.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.570
Oh yeah.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:45.270
Um, and if you can connect the dots between these two topics are these,

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:51.350
these two, um, subject matter experts, then and connected to the context of your

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.190
business, you should be able to move forward.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:59.110
I can go into more detailed examples, but you read Eric Reese's book couple times.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.390
Do you remember the concept of a concierge MVP?

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.190
Yes, I do.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:12.870
It's called a concierge MVP because the only thing that is solid is the front end.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:20.560
They, they bolt on the back end on a as needed basis, but a lot of the, a lot of

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.320
the stuff is literally the guy behind the curtain.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:31.360
So there, there will be people in some, I failed to remember the concrete

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.480
example from, from Reese's book.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.960
But essentially if you go to teams and there's something that's supposed to,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.760
there's experience acts like it sends an email, but that's actually not hooked up.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.760
Then there would be a physical person behind the scenes that sends the email.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:50.600
Okay.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.520
Now, why is that important?

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:58.210
It's important because when you ship these services, at least in Reese's concept,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.530
you're trying to come to a decision on, are we going in a valuable direction?

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:03.370
Okay.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:10.850
So having, uh, um, shipping an MVP to a couple hundred people and having one

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:18.970
guy for a couple of weeks forward emails manually is cheaper in the grand scheme of

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.570
things.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.370
It's a way of seeing if they want to send email, if they're going to use it.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:23.730
Right.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.250
It's a cheaper way to evaluate that.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.090
Right.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.090
Um, and it's the same thing with a lot of the data database

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.850
architectures are expensive.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.370
No, no, I get that.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.650
And that makes a ton of sense.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.730
You want to, uh, the part I like about that a lot where we've honestly failed

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.730
in a few cases is, which is a little, when you're doing this sort of a V one thing,

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:50.500
it can happen a little bit more, but we want to, I totally believe that you just

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.340
don't get value from your engineering effort until the customers have validated

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.620
and tried out what you're doing.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.180
And so if you need to hack together some things on the backend or have a guy

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.460
behind the curtain, given that experience, see if it works, it's great.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.460
Yes.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.280
There where we've, uh, there's a term I've used for that.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.680
Probably can't, I can use it on the air, but when you are building a product

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:22.450
and it's all for yourself and you keep on adding features and features, but

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.090
they're really things that you want and you've never validated them.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.130
You know what I call that?

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:35.620
What technical, we'll call it self-satisfaction because you really,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:42.340
you're just, and, uh, seriously, if you're not using the customer, if you're not

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.530
involving a partner, you're just playing with yourself, right?

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.650
It's, it's not the most appropriate metaphor, but it's the one that comes

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.890
directly to mind when you're just focusing inward on trying to make a product

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.050
and thinking just in your own mind that it's the right one for customers

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.850
without getting any validation from them.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.090
Yeah.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:11.450
It reminds me of the data phase that Steve Rowe, uh, invented on, on the

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:18.010
episode of a few episodes back, which is the, the data affirmation phase,

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.330
which is I only trust the data as long as it agrees with me.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.160
Ah, yeah.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.220
Right.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.800
Um, wouldn't you also call that confirmation bias?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.320
It's absolutely confirmation bias.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:38.140
Um, I just noticed that we, that's one thing.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.660
That's why to do it.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.140
That's what, that's what Reese's thing is saying.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.340
Hey, there's an ROI here, do what's cheap to figure out whether or not there's an,

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.260
there's a viable investment.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:55.480
Now the pop and dyke, um, principle that I want to pull in.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.080
I like that the pop and dyke principle.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:06.500
Um, is so Mary in particular lists out seven different principles around

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.780
what makes something agile.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.020
And, um, but her principles aren't, that's not quite right.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:20.730
It's, it's sort of principled rules of how to go about agile.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:25.810
And one of the ones that I'm most fond of that I, that resonates with me on this

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.790
topic of emergent design is something known as deferring commitment.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:40.510
And what that specifically means is from a, from a technical standpoint,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:51.010
you defer any major decisions until the last possible responsible moment.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:51.330
Yep.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:51.930
Absolutely.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:52.490
Right.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:18:00.510
And, um, an example, um, when I first introduced this to my first agile team

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:08.840
when I was in bank, um, I had a whole bunch of developers coming to me saying,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:14.450
Hey, Brent, I was thinking about this design and I would like to add this

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.850
thing because somebody might want to one day fill in the blank.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.930
That just then shivers up my spine.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:27.570
I actually, I actually, um, when I, when it had occurred with enough of my staff,

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.970
I pulled together a team meeting and I said, all right guys, from here on out

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:38.130
anytime someone comes to me with, with anything that contains the words, someone

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:45.130
might want to just realize that the answer is no, think, think about what

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.090
you're trying to, to actually ask for.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:53.530
And then here's more than likely my, my response.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.050
Okay.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:19:00.520
Um, I told them, um, pointing them out to the defer commitment and I said,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:08.900
what this means is we're not going to implement anything under the premise

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.580
that someone might want to one day.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:21.940
We, um, as I, as, as you know, anyway, um, part of how I do agile before I can

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.180
declare done, we do a process called customer validation.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:31.120
So we actually go talk to the customer and validate that we, that the reason

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:37.840
why we built it is, um, it's solving the problem that we intended it to solve.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.640
And we do that by not theorizing by actually talking to a customer or looking

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.640
at instrumentation, but I said, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, Hey, you

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.710
might be right, but you are not to implement it.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:59.890
What you are to do instead is re-arc the design of your, uh, what you're

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:07.640
doing right now, such that if you are proven to be correct, we can shift

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.880
to that design and moments.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.640
Sure.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.440
Right.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.520
So it's about making the architecture adaptable.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.080
Had a very similar conversation yesterday.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.840
We had someone come to our team and say, Hey, we need to do this feature by, uh,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.040
we own a little bit of the product features around, uh, how we deploy rings.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.360
And without going into details, someone came from one of the team said, Hey,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.720
we really need to build this feature.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.560
Cause customers are going to want it.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.240
And immediately my team's well-trained.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.990
I mean, even the most junior guy on my team says, what customers are asking for

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.560
this and they said, well, no customers are asking for it yet, but

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.440
they're going to want it.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.030
How do you know they're going to want it?

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.390
Well, because we think they need it.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.710
These are, I mean, actual quotes and it's so well-trained.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.830
He says, okay, let's do this.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:06.190
Let's, uh, go ahead and not do anything that will block this from happening,

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.910
but let's just hold this for two weeks.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.750
And we'll see if any questions come in about this, it's all ready to go.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.430
We can turn it on, but there's definitely more important work to do right now.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.830
So let's just not do this now until we know that it's really needed.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:21.050
Right.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.250
So it was perfect example.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.900
It's like, and in my case, it's like you have this mountain of stuff.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:33.660
I know you need to do, I know why are you even asking about how are you often the

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.300
weeds of, I, we think customers are going to need this because I have work.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.900
I know that is much more important.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.780
We don't have time right now for, for you thinking about what customers want.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:55.160
There is, um, wait, you don't want to, you don't want to completely shut down.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.560
Exploratory ideas.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.480
No, no, no.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.800
Which is not what you're saying.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.320
You're saying it remains in the backlog.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.040
It will remain in the backlog.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.220
And, um, what, uh, actually I'm glad you brought up backlog.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.660
So backlog grooming is, is a key part of being able to improve this,

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.020
this front end problem.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:23.610
Um, by, uh, by having it.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:28.650
So for example, there is this system called W S J F weighted

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:34.170
shortage job first, you can look at W S J F on the internet and figure

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:34.970
out the equation.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:35.330
Okay.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:42.480
Um, but it's very equation driven that then the key aspects of it is it

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:49.280
cleverly combines time, criticality, business value, and the cost of doing

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:59.430
the work so that you have, you can then order your backlogs by business ROI.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:08.620
Um, and dynamically the, um, in this particular case, when you go through a

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.790
backlog grooming, right?

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:18.680
Uh, the scenario you just brought up, um, we would revisit it in that couple

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:29.640
of weeks and plug in a new business value number if we have proof of some

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.440
degree that, that this is something that's viable.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.560
One of the advantages again, to echo what we talked about previously and Eric

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.710
Reese is now that we have customers and a few hundred thousand of them, we,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.270
it's much easier for us to make those decisions and see, is this really

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.070
something customers are asking for versus something I think they're going to want.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:59.880
And of course, uh, someone will always come back with, well, if your Henry

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.880
Ford would have worked that way, you just would have got faster horses.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:12.500
Henry Ford's quote is, uh, if we gave people what they wanted, what they

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.620
wanted or no, no, if we asked people what they wanted, they would have

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.740
said faster horses.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.140
Right.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:17.380
Right.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.060
Right.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.400
But, um, I get, so that's, that's used as defense for this.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.160
Well, we need to, we need to innovate.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.530
I'm, I'm a lot like Steve Jobs.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.170
So I want to, that's what I say.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.450
Yeah.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.210
Yeah.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:41.240
So customer data trumps intuition every time.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.240
Well, and the thing is, is that you don't have to make it in us versus them.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.680
Like the, my answer to that would be, Hey, look, we have a system in which

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:57.080
we are going through and we're building things in terms of a validated ROI

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.360
for the business and we're working on most ROI for the business first.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.240
So you know what?

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.920
Sorry, your item.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.800
Great idea, dude.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.080
Even if it's a stupid idea, it's always best to say great idea.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.520
However, the situation is this is intuition driven.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.880
These other ones that are data driven are higher priority.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:24.760
And one day maybe we'll work through and we'll only be working off of

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.360
intuition driven ones and yours will be top of the stack, dude.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.160
Um, but do you lie all the time to your employees?

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.410
Uh, that's not lying.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:35.360
Yeah.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.680
One day we're only going to do intuition based features.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.520
I said maybe.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.940
Um, it has never occurred in, in any period of time that I've seen in my

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:53.770
career, um, the, but the other thing too is, but you know what?

00:25:54.330 --> 00:26:03.750
One of the things we really need to do as a team is make it low friction to get

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.390
this data on these, these fantastic ideas.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.550
Like this guy's trying to come up with an argument.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.910
He's got an intuition.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.710
He's kind of using the old school waterfall way of getting this on the

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:23.740
backlog and you're basically saying, yeah, that, that ship don't sail anymore.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.380
You can't get to where we're going from where you're at.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.910
We can beat this dead horse a lot, but it was just, this one wasn't, it was,

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.400
it was a great idea here and I'm holding up my tunnel vision, uh, glasses.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.080
Uh, one challenge we talk about systems thinking a lot here and this particular

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.280
problem, um, particular solution, particular feature, looking for a home,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:27:00.060
uh, there were, uh, scale and distribution and test ramifications that were a huge part

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.580
of making this change that just weren't thought of.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.960
So there was, there was more to it.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.760
But the, the, the issue is, is that this guy is trying to get it booked in the end.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.120
Yeah.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.560
And what the, where I would have pushed back on that is say, no, let's figure

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.080
out how to do, um, uh, a spike in a prototype.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:30.280
Let's figure out how we do a, a low impact AP test of, of whether or not customers

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080
will actually value your thing.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.360
So this is where I would have, I would have take you have a hundreds of thousands

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:45.240
of users now, how do you, how do you AB tests with just a few thousand and do

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.680
something concierge to prove out this feature.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.000
Sure.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.840
And then the next thing is how do you make AB testing a feature for your product?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.360
And how can you tell via some sort of monitoring or what's your metric?

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.440
What's your KPI to determine the business value of doing this?

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.760
Is this, how is this providing value and how are you measuring that value?

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:05.600
Yeah.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:12.550
The, um, I actually have this discussion with, with my own team quite often.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:20.030
Now, um, we spend a lot of time building pilots and prototypes.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.080
Okay.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:27.770
Cause, um, much for the same reason, like I, one of my most used speeches is the

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:37.120
pivot or persevere speech, the, we will build prototypes and I have every now and

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.120
again, I have a couple of people on my team going, this, the performance of this

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.520
is going to blow and the scale of this is going to blow.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.400
We really should spend the next three months and I'm like, stop.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.040
We don't know anyone's going to use this.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:58.530
So let's get, I get that, that you want to build something that you're proud of.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:03.250
And I want you to build something that you're proud of, but let me ask you, if

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:09.090
I spend those four months and we release this and we found, found that no one uses

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.000
it, have you built something that you're proud of?

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.640
It just makes my heart sink.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.000
I'd be, I just feel like I would, that that's depressing.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:17.920
Yes.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:24.780
I'm like, no, let's, let's, um, get something out there.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.300
Let's be transparent in terms of what it is.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:35.660
Let's find a set of early adopters that are, that aren't allergic to, you

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.620
know, bugs or perf issues, and let's prove that this is something that, that

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.020
solves a problem before we go and solidify it.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:45.520
Right.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.640
And we will, right?

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.480
That's, that's the other thing.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.280
And you also have to be careful that you don't have too many prototypes in

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:59.000
flight, um, that you can't scale to solidify the ones that prove out to be

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.200
positive, right?

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.200
That, that ends up just creating this hordes of technical debt.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.060
Indeed.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.580
Hey, I want to go on to another subject.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.140
That's okay.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:10.940
Yes.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.660
You all right with that?

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.220
Yes.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.980
Let me just pause here a second.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:14.580
All right.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:23.290
So while you're doing that, what I'll say in a nutshell is concierge MVP realize

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.890
that the experiential stuff is important.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:33.090
Uh, on backlog grooming, one thing I didn't mention is, uh, I have a rule on my team.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:41.660
Whenever we go through a backlog grooming, no more than one third of the total cost

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.660
of the team can be on pure architectural.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.240
Okay.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.040
Cause pure architectural isn't what improves the brand.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.560
Correct.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.240
All right.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.720
Okay.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.360
Hey, do you remember?

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:54.680
No.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.120
Yeah, you're almost as old as I am.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:04.550
Do you remember, uh, a long time ago, I gave you some questions off

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.350
of a test certification quiz.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.880
I do not going to do that today.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:10.840
Uh-huh.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.160
But instead I have some questions off of a sample CSM certified

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.480
scrum master test for you.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:20.390
Okay.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.310
Looking forward to it.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.670
It's a 10 question quiz.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.590
I'm going to skip the ones that have long answers just for brevity.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.030
Okay.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.750
But, uh, we'll kind of go through this.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.910
Um, are you ready, Brett?

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:32.300
I probably play along at home.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:32.820
Feel free.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.500
Write your answers.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.300
These fill in the blank, multiple choice, multiple choice.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.100
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:37.940
He's a multiple choice.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.380
And we'll go over your answers and then we'll go at the end.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.140
I think we get, uh, like, uh, some explanation.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:44.660
Okay.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.220
Okay.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:45.940
Some are pretty easy.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.500
Um, involving the team in planning and estimating and providing early feedback

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:57.500
on delivery velocity is best used to mitigate what kind of risk schedule

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.500
flaws, requirements, creep, employee turnover, or poor productivity.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.090
All right.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.050
Do that one more time.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:12.610
Involving the team in planning and estimating and providing early feedback

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:18.670
on delivery velocity is best used to mitigate what kind of risk schedule

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:24.710
flaw requirement, creep, employee turnover, or poor productivity schedule.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:35.060
Question two, which of the following is the best approach for estimation?

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:43.550
Expert opinion, analogy, dis-aggregation, a combination of all of the above.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.350
Dis-aggregation.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.070
That's the word on here.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.780
Expert opinion, analogy, dis-aggregation, a combination of all of the above.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.390
I have no clue what dis-aggregation means in this context.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.950
So I'll just go with, uh, expert.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:04.470
I mean, the right answer is probably combination of all the above,

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.870
but I'll go with expert opinion.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:09.720
All right.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.550
Uh, this is a horribly designed webpage.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.930
Um, this question is too long.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:19.530
I'm skipping it.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:27.260
When forming an agile project team, it is best to use, I'm going to, I'm going to

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:32.500
give the answers out of order, uh, best to use top management officials, highly

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:38.300
specialized developers, generalized specialists, or all of the above.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.330
I'll go with generalized specialists.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.040
What was the first answer?

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.200
The top generalized specialist was the first one.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.400
So I know his top executives or some crap.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:49.600
Yeah.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.880
Top management officials.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.680
Yeah.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.280
On a scrum.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:53.800
Yeah.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.880
Uh, this one's fairly easy.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.080
Scrum would have you fire those people.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.680
What is the unit of measurement that is used to measure the size of a

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.640
user story for agile projects?

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.040
Function points, story points, work breakdown points, velocity points.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.960
Story points.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.160
Yeah, that one was pretty easy.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.120
I should have just skipped it.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.430
Okay.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:21.220
Uh, how is agile planning different from the traditional approach to planning?

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.820
Agile planning is done only once agile planning is non iterative.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.280
Agile planning places emphasis on the plan.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.360
Agile planning places emphasis on planning and is iterative.

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:36.810
It's the last one.

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:38.370
Yeah, but it's not on the plan.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.410
It's on planning.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:40.210
Yeah.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.420
That one's long.

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.890
Oh, so far, this isn't as funny as the ISQT thing.

00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:51.330
Wait, this is the one I wanted to lead up to.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:51.770
Okay.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:35:00.220
The process of testing delivered or quote, done, done stories is known as unit

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:07.040
testing, integration, testing, exploratory testing, or release testing.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.780
Given the non sequitur between the answers and the question, I'll

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:17.300
read the question again, the process of testing delivered or done, done

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:22.180
stories is known as unit integration, exploratory, or release testing.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.380
I will say in that list, it's probably release testing.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.280
And dear God, I hope the correct answer isn't unit testing.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.230
Now I'm going to skip the rest of it and look at the answers and discuss.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.750
All right.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.790
You've reached the end of the quiz.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.830
I'm done.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:44.870
Ooh, I skipped a bunch.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.550
We got 40% right, but I skipped a bunch.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:46.870
Okay.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:47.710
I think we did well.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.750
Um, the first one we got right involving the team and planning and

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.750
estimating, blah, blah, blah, is best used to mitigate schedule flaws.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:56.950
Well done.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.570
And for which of the following is the best approach for estimation?

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:08.290
It was an answer, the answer all of the above this aggregation.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:08.970
I need to look up.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.490
Does it, I see there's a lot of words there.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.930
There's a source that comes from a Mike Cohen's agile

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.090
estimating and planning book.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:16.560
Okay.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:23.660
This aggregation is probably the process of taking a large story and

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.220
breaking it into smaller pieces.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.820
So, um, at which point in time, I agree.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.180
Yeah.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.020
So when forming an agile project team, it is best to have general,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.860
generalized specialists as any listener of the podcast, any of the three,

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.540
all of the three know between those options.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.860
But what I didn't know is, uh, there's source for that specialized

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.220
generalists who would even be better.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.180
There's source for that is a book that I haven't read by, uh,

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.140
Michelle sliger and Stacey abroad, Rick called the software project

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.820
managers bridge to agility.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:52.270
It's in that book.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.750
Nope.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:55.870
I will take a look at it.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.590
Story points, of course are correct.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.190
That's also from Mike Cohen's agile estimating and planning book.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:04.870
Um, and the planning one also same book, same answer.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:05.590
Very good.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.000
Uh, we skipped that one.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.960
Now here's the one that this came up on Twitter and I thought, what the F,

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.080
cause I've read this book that they cite the process of testing delivered

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.160
or done, done stories is apparently known as exploratory testing.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.020
And so then this is, this is where the tangent happens.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.500
They cited, uh, James Shores book, the art of agile development.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.980
Which I have read.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:33.740
Okay.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.740
And I went back and looked at it again.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.020
Not well known in the ET world as a.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.260
No, no, no.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.620
He, that book is really good.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.620
Cause it talks about using expert testers for exploratory testing to help

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.780
figure out, to help with things and where they can plug in.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:55.340
And, and the authors of this test made this huge freaking leap that,

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:59.980
oh yeah, done, done is the, is the act of exploratory testing, which is this.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.800
Massive leap in kind of the wrong direction.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.520
So it's just a weird, again, the rest of the test wasn't too bad.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.760
It wasn't as crazy as the, as that test certification, but this question,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.640
no, it's, and that's just weird.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.120
It's just weird, right?

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.680
So luckily James Shore.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.160
Um, so what happened?

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:27.400
Uh, someone on Twitter posted this and said, this books, this book

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.920
doesn't get exploratory testing implying that.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.560
And I replied and James Shore was on the tweet and I replied back and said,

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.280
I don't think it actually says this.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.280
James Shore says there's no way in hell it says this.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:39.640
Yeah.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.160
That book is, I don't know if you've read the art of agile, his book.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.920
No, it's I like it a lot.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.160
I think it's really, really well done.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.280
It's a nice holistic systems approach to the art of agile development.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.480
The art of agile development.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.650
That seemed like a book that would be up my alley.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.090
Yeah.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.770
I should take a look at it.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:58.890
Um, easy to read.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.650
I like it, but explore it.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.290
Tori.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:01.850
No.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.600
So the, so first and foremost, like you just talked through like on,

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:13.210
on Shores book, he's like, uh, no, I should not be cited as the proof

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.690
that this answer is correct.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:15.090
Right.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:18.610
But the other thing from a scrum side, right?

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:23.210
It does the text there say, Hey, you should hire expert testers.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.530
No, not here.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:29.890
Uh, James shore talks about the, how the value of expert testers, uh,

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:30.330
okay.

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:36.010
In because agile development, anybody other than a dev on a scrum team

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.730
is sort of anti scrum.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.060
It's one of the reasons why I don't like scrum.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:47.420
Um, but, um, exploratory testing in this context, like telling a bunch of

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.860
devs to go do exploratory testing.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.220
Um, sure.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.140
It's useful.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:58.220
But how, how do you declare done done from that befuddles me?

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.980
So, but there's a logical foul scene here.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:08.620
I forget which one it is, but Prince having tea drinking problems.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:09.340
Yes.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:15.340
It started off with having tea, set a coffee, stupid building.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.380
Could walk up stairs.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.180
So earlier we're talking about Eric Reese's, uh, lean startup book.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:28.260
And it would be the equivalent of me reading that book, seeing something

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.100
about, I have to think of a good concept.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.060
I can screw up from there.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:38.200
Um, hummingbirds see what the hell.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.940
So I read about the concierge MVP and, and from that I make, oh,

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.960
services don't matter.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.520
We just hire people on the, what we're going to do is we're going to hire a

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.040
team of people on the backend to take care of everything on the backend.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.000
We're only writing a UI.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.140
Right.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.580
Like this massive, no, that's not what I meant.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:04.940
We are going to create the UI and connected straight to mechanical Turk.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.340
Oh crap.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.260
Yeah, that'll work.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.260
That's a good idea.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.580
It's like, yeah, you obviously glossed through here.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.580
And, and again, I, it's a sample test and I give the test writers a break,

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:25.060
but I feel bad you're taking the CSM tests.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.580
You get to that question, you go, what the hell?

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.220
Yeah.

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:35.280
I mean, the thing is, is that most of these as, as, uh, so you know, I'm

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.700
certified and so a lot of these certification tests are essentially how

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.700
well can you regurgitate the class that we taught you?

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:52.200
So it'd be interesting to find the slide deck, um, for this test.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.120
That presents the material in the first place.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.440
Cause I'm sure there's a strong chance that the ET that they've listed here

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.560
is not the same sort of ET that we think of in the test community.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:05.800
No.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.720
And again, having read the book, I know it's just like, it's mentioned a lot.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.440
It's, it's brought up in very good way.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.160
It's not like it's over abused or abused wrongly.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.160
Uh, it's just a weird leap there.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.920
And it almost sounds like they had different, because it's a sample test.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.400
It could have had different people running questions.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.490
I'm not sure what happened, but some cray cray went on for sure.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:25.330
For sure.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.770
I will.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.410
And we didn't answer any other ones, but I really wanted to lead to that one.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:32.800
So I, um, uh, I found the test, I found the testing question, which was not set

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.040
it on the internet, but I know how to use search engines.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.640
So I found the right test and I wanted to kind of get to that question.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.080
That was my, that was my goal for the day.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.440
Not as much.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.040
Well done golf club.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.640
I'm going to, I'm going to ask you one more question.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:43.920
All right.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.680
Then we're going to get out of here.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.680
Which of the following is not one of the five core risk areas

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.000
common to all projects?

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:51.760
Really?

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.960
I should have you list the five core common risk areas, but which one is not

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.920
specification breakdown, scope creep, strategic alienation, and intrinsic

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.720
schedule flaw.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:06.660
All right.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.620
Let's not one of the five core risk areas.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.060
So let's do one at a time.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.900
What's the first one specification breakdown.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.300
That is a risk area scope creep for sure.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.580
Risk area strategic alienation.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.740
Have no frigging clue what that is.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.980
Intrinsic schedule flaw.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.970
That's a risk area as well.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.090
The way I interpret.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:29.730
You're correct.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:34.450
The reason I brought this up, like if you are looking, if you're like, have a

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:39.110
nerd band, like, you know, a lot, you know, a nerd band, like angry weasel.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.390
No, no, a nerd band.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:45.690
Like, like you, it's like bad synth rock kind of stuff.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:47.410
These are your band names.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.290
Like Flakossegal.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.370
Ladies and gentlemen, specification breakdown.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:54.410
God, strategic alienation.

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:55.810
Rock on.

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.530
Everybody wears scope creep.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:03.570
This is called lover love radar booger knocker.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:11.380
What do you would that's the long ass blurb there explain what strategic

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.420
alienation is?

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.460
No, it's just a made up word.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.820
These, this is the disadvantage of multiple choice.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.900
What tests are there are, you don't have to know the answer.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.580
You just have to have critical thinking.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:28.540
Right.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:32.540
But in my case, I'm picking the thing that I I'm like, yes, yes.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.540
No clue.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:34.660
Yes.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.100
Okay.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.140
Let's go with no clue.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.740
And they picked like a, I don't even know what that means.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.500
I can't fathom what that means.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.870
So alienation means rejection.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:45.190
Yeah.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.150
But I'm doing it strategically.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.910
So I'm going to strategically reject like features.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.310
Like I'm using my strategy to reject this work.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:56.290
Reject.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:57.130
I don't know.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:02.690
Maybe customer pruning like, Hey, you can't prune the customers.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.680
No, but you can.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.680
It's not nice.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.600
You can target.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.920
You can say, Hey, we're not going to try to solve all problems for all people.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.760
We're going to solve.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.920
Um, some of the problems for some of the people.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.720
There's a phrase I use often nowadays at my current work.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:28.210
It is way better to make 50% of the people, a hundred percent happy than a

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.250
hundred percent of the people, 50% happy.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:31.210
Absolutely.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.450
That makes sense.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:32.730
Yeah.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.620
And that's not a risk.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.140
And if that's what strategic alienation is, it's definitely not a risk.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:44.800
It's a go forth and alienate strategy things.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:45.360
Cool.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.920
Hey, a question for you.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.320
Yeah.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.680
Have you ever taken electronics class?

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.120
I think the safest answer for me to say is no.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:57.920
All right.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.920
Cause I feel like mocking is coming.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.040
Yeah.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.440
Brent just laid his phone on top of the microphone wire.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.160
So that buzzing you just heard is thank is thanks.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:08.880
Thanks to Brent.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.720
Oh, gotcha.

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:18.710
You'd be great in a band.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.670
You should join strategic alienation and be like their sound guy.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.140
Right on.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:26.820
All right.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:27.620
Okay.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.660
We are done.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:29.940
We did 50.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.060
I think this is probably our, I think we do one more this year.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:34.580
Yeah.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.740
And we have to do, um, we will do our best of 2016 show.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:39.960
Right on.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:48.030
Well, we'll talk about our favorite podcast blogs and celebrity presidents.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.260
Yeah.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.340
Something like that.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.490
Okay.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.090
I am.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.250
Bri not Brit Allen.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.200
Yeah.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.280
And I'm Brent.
