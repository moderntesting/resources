WEBVTT

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:18.130
Hey, Alan. It's Brent. And we're back for another episode of AB testing. Episode number 78. We've

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.290
been doing this a long time and I don't think we're getting any better. Well, let me put it this way.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.280
We're, but we're, maybe we're not getting any worse either. There is that. Maybe. There's always a

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.160
Silver Lane. Maybe, maybe we're getting better. AB testing is a podcast about a lot of things,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.720
including testing, software quality, agile. What we've been talking about a lot lately is

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.520
our concept of the modern tester and what that means. Anything else I missed? Big topics?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.560
Organizational change, leadership, management, those all fall in here. Highly customer focused.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.120
The customers are you, the listeners. So we take feedback from you a lot, both in our topics that

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.720
we're developing that we'll talk about today, as well as questions for listeners. Send those in via

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.820
Twitter at Alan Page at Brent M. Jensen. Alan at angry weasel.com is fine. Anything else I missed?

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.700
Brent's laughing while he goes, look, Alan makes a funny face when he's thinking.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm thinking we should actually sit down and actually write this out and practice

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.160
reading it as if we're not reading it. You don't understand. This is what I'm doing. I am

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.520
prototyping intros until I find little bits and pieces I like. Just doing this

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.800
cold, I would get the wrong value for the customer. I need to try some things that eventually

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.400
will have something that's scripted for a while, then memorized, and then I'll change words and

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.610
then we'll morph into something else. Everything I do in life is adaptive. Everything is a learning

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.050
experience. I do it. I learn from it. I modify it as needed to make it better and better and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.450
better. That's why, actually, if that was true, I'd be a much better person.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.850
Yeah, I was going to say, that is a fantastic rationalization for the fact that you're freaking

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.500
old and forgot what you said last week. I'll go with it, because I'm all about

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.660
adapting. Didn't we agree that although I'm older chronologically, that you are much more the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.700
older fart? In certain contexts. All. In certain people.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.220
No, not all. For certainly not all. There is a lot of places where I'll tell people that I am.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.710
47, going on 10. All right. Don't tap the table.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.640
It's always something with you. Don't play with the microphone. Don't tap the table.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.560
Don't shake your leg. Don't pull your pants down during the recording.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.160
Fair enough. Okay. So, let's do a podcast. We've already, last episodes, we have gone all over

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.200
where is the weasel just reminding people that I am heading off to test bash next week. Looking

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.640
forward to it. Going to be fun. I'm giving a talk called Adventures in Modern Testing. In

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.520
the program as experiences, I've changed the title. I don't think it matters that much.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.080
Adventures in Modern Testing, where we will talk about what modern testing is.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.440
And if you were caught up on your episodes last time, Brent and I talked about modern

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.920
testing principles, which was a lot of fun. I had some sketched out ideas, some drafts.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.760
We vetted through them and changed them. In the week since we recorded on our Slack channel,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.070
one of the three.slack.com, contact us if you like an invitation. We vetted them a lot.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:09.490
We did. And there was a lot of activity on Twitter as well. That's the thing that actually really

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:17.090
surprised me was the number of pictures we got and presentations we got of people already

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.450
just incorporating them, which makes me feel a little guilty because in my view,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.490
I don't think they're fully born yet. They're not ready yet. They are in beta.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.290
I would say they're out of alpha. They're into beta. I think of it like a recipe.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.780
And I think it's like baking, right? And when you bake, you put all the liquid in one bowl

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.460
and all the dry goods in another bowl. And in my view, I'm still kind of looking at the

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.940
dry bowl. I'm like, am I missed? Did I put baking soda in there?

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.140
Does it need a little bit more salt? Here's some insight that may tell you and some listeners

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:09.460
much more about me. I love to cook. So do I. I do not love to bake. And the difference is,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.740
baking is chemistry and needs to be very exact. I'm an adaptive cooker tasting as I go,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.860
trying new combinations out. You can't do that baking or you have to have much more

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.100
patients to retry and retry and retry and get it right. And also like chemistry track very closely

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.580
your formulas and what you did. I like cooking because I can do two aspects of it. One,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.980
I love the experimentation. Well, what? Biggest three. I love eating. That's probably the biggest

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.380
thing. As do I. I love the experimentation part of it. I love trying new things out.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.130
I also like this is sort of the leadership orchestration project management part of it.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:59.170
I also think it's fun to create a meal of several dishes and cook them so they're and plan ahead

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.250
so they all complete about the same time. Oh, you like the timing aspect of it? The timing

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:10.370
aspect of it I enjoy as well. It's a conductor of an orchestra. I completely agree. So I do

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.970
Thanksgiving at my house and that is what is like I'll spend a half hour with a with a spreadsheet

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.770
going, okay, I want to do this, this. I need to start this at that time. I may take some notes.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.570
I don't do a spreadsheet. Now I do because I'll be so when I do Thanksgiving, I generally do the

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.930
whole thing and there's like 10 to 15 different things that I'm making all in that same day.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:40.820
Wow. Yeah, it's a lot of fun. Tangent. Oh my gosh, tangents are so rare on this show.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.660
I did not realize in all the years we have worked together that we share a love of cooking, although

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:57.780
I am not afraid to go and tweak baking recipes. But I take some confidence and experience.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.780
Alton Brown. Do you know that name? I do not know that name. Oh, you need to learn that name. But

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.340
pause for a second. If you tangent inception, you saw my technical testing talk where one of

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.340
the slides I showed a picture of a kitchen and talked about how I liked cooking because I like

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.940
the exploratory nature of it. Maybe you didn't realize that I actually meant it. No, no. So

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:29.060
generally when I get get your slides, I get your slides. They don't come with audio. So I have seen

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:39.330
your picture of your beautiful kitchen. It's not my kind. It's a stock photo. But anyway, Alton Brown,

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:47.890
I am surprised that you do not know who this guy is. He no longer does the show. He did like 10

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:57.170
seasons of a show called Good Eats. I don't watch much TV other than things that I would binge.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:07.250
But in the cooking world, he is absolutely my hero. And he's kind of like the Mr. Wizard of cooking.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:15.570
So his shows, he'll go through a recipe and he'll explain to you why the recipe works.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:24.750
And he is a massive hacker. So he like one of those key principles is he does not like single

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:33.280
tasking tools in the kitchen. So he'll go through and say this particular tool, because this

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.020
particular tool, you can use it for this, this and this other thing. Like Apple cores. I don't

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.940
think he would be a supporter of Apple cores because that pretty much does one thing.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.180
He doesn't even do it that well. I don't have one.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.340
Melon ballers though, even though the called melon ballers can be used for so much more than that.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:09:00.940
Little mini ice cream scoop. Anyway, so there was this one episode and this actually might

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:10.380
be relevant to you. There was this one episode where he smoked a salmon and he used a hot plate,

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:23.260
a pie tin, a cardboard box that he then poked holes in it and put essentially a small little

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:31.170
oven rack inside of it. And he created a little a temporary smoking oven outside

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:40.050
with just like crap you have around the house. Like I love this guy. I'm so surprised you've

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:51.980
never heard of him. There is, I have all of his books, one of them signed, I met him in person.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.660
Look at your little fanboy. Oh, I am totally like, I love this guy.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:08.540
There is one thing that we went and saw him in person. He came and he did a talk of,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:16.460
if you will, at third place books in Lake Forest Park. And one of the things he talked about is

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:24.690
there is a lot of people who will go out and spend several hundred dollars on stoneware for

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:30.350
the oven for like pizzas or things like that. He's like, don't do that. All you have to do

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:39.070
is go to your local nursery. And you know those terracotta pots? Generally you will find

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:47.140
a big, terracotta pots will also have a flat piece that you put the pot on top

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:55.250
to hold overflow water. He's like, sure, that's what it can do. But if you grease it up,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:05.730
that's a $10 stoneware piece. And if you take a flower pot, turn it upside down

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:15.710
on top of that piece, that becomes an itty bitty little stoneware oven. And I'll tell you,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:23.570
he taught me this, that little stoneware oven. This part you probably don't care. Nothing cooks

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:33.650
roasted chicken better than that thing. I have done actually roasted garlic in that

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:40.690
and it's fantastic. The difference because the stoneware creates a convection heat.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.980
When you just pop things in your ovens, you're going to have hot spots, cold spots. That's why

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:52.620
you have to rotate the damn trays all the damn time. But when you do this, all the heat emanates

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:58.220
all the time because ston- terracotta holds on the heat for a very long time. And so it

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:05.660
evens it out on the inside. I like the idea of, I like the hacking aspect of it. I don't like

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:11.900
following directions all the time. I never have. But he walks you through why it works. And once

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:22.940
you know why it works, then hacking or rather innovating what you're doing is so much easier.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.580
Yeah. And that reminds me of, and then we'll get back to the show people care about in a bit,

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:37.410
in music theory courses in college, we spent a year, a little over a year, a year and a half,

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:44.770
just studying why music works the way it does. Isn't it true that all you need to know is the

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:53.440
rule of fits? No, I'll go with yes. I'm going to go with no. So studying why music works

00:12:53.440 --> 00:13:00.400
through different areas and what and why chord progressions work and why things sound the way

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:09.040
they do. And you really, a lot of, well, now useless, but at the time, very interesting data.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.260
And then finally, like in the last quarter, quarter and a half, you began to learn how to

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.140
break the rules, but you have to kind of know the rules a little bit to break the rules. And

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:27.940
I'm okay with that. I think I've told you before, I'm a martial artist and does that mean you're

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:34.160
an artist? You draw pictures of Mars. What does that mean? It means I'm a black belt and take

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.440
one dough and you keep talking. I will show you what that means. Okay. Great. Great.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.040
The, but it is really true, but you don't, you don't really understand it until you get there.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:55.100
It is really true that martial arts studies actually start when you get your black belt.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:01.100
That's not the destination, but you don't, uh, all the other color belt stuff is necessary

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:11.660
so that you're ready to begin. That is a great way to look at it. So let's talk, just rewind a little

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.180
bit. I wish I had a rewind sound effect. Uh, I may be, I'm probably not going to. If I did,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:24.060
it would sound better than the sound Brett just made. Okay. So modern testing principles.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.060
We listed some principles last week and we're not going to read through them again. They're

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:34.300
in iteration. I can tell you if you thought they were in adaption, there we are iterating

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.100
and adapting, but adaption is the goal. Uh, if you thought these aren't very good, they're

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.540
better. Uh, not going to read them out again today and entirely because they're not done.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:50.700
Maybe next time, but they are getting much, much closer. I'm getting much, much happier.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.370
So that's cool. But first, and I want to talk about a couple in particular, a bit more

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:02.530
controversial in a minute, but I think first, one thing we didn't talk about, I think it's

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:09.410
actually better as a flashback is to back up a little bit and talk about why we have these

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:17.460
principles and why we started working on these and, and sort of the background of the modern

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.980
tester and why we believe there's a new way to describe a new way, a adapted way to describe

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:28.580
testing, which it really is. I didn't say just to please you and to be a Dick. No, it's really,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.540
you might think, well, these sound a lot like you're just being a good agile tester. And

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.140
that's true, but there's a little more to it. There's an, as an adaptation, iteration,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:45.330
evolution. There's some reasons to bring these points up. And so I want to start there and talk

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.690
about those. Does that work? Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Alan and I have been talking about

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:56.850
this. Why offline? And I've, I've written it down. I've promised Alan that I will not be reading it

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:04.430
on the show today, but it is, it is a work in progress and I'll release it, you know, soonish.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:11.980
So why, why do we think this, the modern principles are, or the modern testing principles are needed?

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:22.800
I would say in a nutshell is because the world has changed and the world has changed in significant

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:30.720
ways that we very firmly believe in. And I don't think it's actually just belief. I think

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.560
there's evidence. The world, I'm going to be devil's advocate over here. The world is always

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.480
changing. What's significant about the changes that you're talking about? Let me, let me, okay.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:47.010
So to finish the thought, I think the world has changed and the belief that I have is,

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:56.000
is that what got tests to be an important role inside software industry

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.100
isn't going to, you know, the phrase, what got us here, isn't going to get us there.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.060
I think most of the three have heard that before. Yeah, I think, I think

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:16.940
so. What's different? Number, number one, most critically with software becoming easy to produce.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:27.870
We have so much stuff on soft our services. There are a lot of advancements and techniques around

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:37.730
continuous delivery. Unlike any time in history before, customer, customers have a lot more choices.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:46.740
And whatever company you're in, it is a lot easier for another company to compete with you.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:58.050
I know of just a ton of stories of just single people, able to release something that takes a

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:07.360
chunk out of, of systems or software that large industries have gone on. A better example,

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:14.750
I think might be is Android, right? Ten years ago, I was having conversations with people going,

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:25.150
what Google's trying to bone OS dude, windows has, but you know, 18 trillion lines of code.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:31.060
Android is never going to be able to do that. Yeah, wrong.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.760
So to paraphrase, I think the big points that I would take out of that is

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:43.620
companies are shipping faster so fast that every day, I would say, is not backed up by fact,

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.500
but I think is probably true. Every day, more and more companies are moving towards continuous

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:54.290
deployment. It's not only companies are shipping faster, but they kind of have to. Because as

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.850
companies ship faster, I was getting there. Go ahead. I was getting there. Stop banging the

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:06.320
table. I apologize for my friend Thumper here. So I think in addition to people are shipping

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:13.340
faster, continuous deployment coming more popular. Now that breeds competition because you're,

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.140
I'm getting updates faster than you. And here's someone new, as you mentioned, coming to market.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.460
And again, just paraphrasing what you said. Yep. All these things are super important. So

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.080
when Microsoft hired their first tester back in the eighties, there's an article about this in

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.520
in the book that I wrote that I'm not going to mention the name of anymore.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:39.570
They hired a tester because the devs were spending, believe it or not, the devs were doing

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.690
their coding, they're spending too much time running the test. They wanted someone to come

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.680
help run all the tests for them. So they hired a high school intern just to come in and run the

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.000
tests. And I thought, well, this is pretty convenient. Have someone do all my testing for

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.080
me. And it grew and it grew and it grew. And the world of, and we lived in a world

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.400
for a long time where we built something for a long time. Then we tested it. When I worked in

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.160
the office org on, on office communicators later became link, which later became Skype for business.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.600
Uh, I was even at that time working, I had worked on windows before, but I was kind of

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:21.440
blown away in office. Uh, this was early mid early two thousands, maybe mid two thousands.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.420
But the schedule was a coding milestone, which was fairly short, maybe two months,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:35.250
and then almost a year of stabilization. And even at that time, I thought this is

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:42.420
massively inefficient. So I'm off on a tangent, but anyway, I fully agree that the points you

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:49.860
made around, uh, what is changing significantly recently are very obvious. Uh, and which is

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:56.190
why I think when we talk about these principles, we see head nods on most of them. Yeah. The, the

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:05.330
only important thing I think that you missed out on, on your synopsis was again, um, as in, and

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:15.440
it's hard for me to phrase this as a serial thing because these three items play off of each other.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.680
So it's, it's really hard to say which is the chicken, which is the egg. Okay. And that is,

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:31.060
we're delivering faster at the same time. Um, that is breeding strong competition. And at the same time,

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:39.940
I don't even know if it's because of the other two customer switching cost has gone way down.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.020
That's something I hear talked about a lot. The idea that, I mean, think about this on your app,

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.610
on your phone, you go, I don't like this one. Let me try another one. And I do this all the

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.690
time. I'm an app switcher and I go, I'm going to use this one to track this thing that I do.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:57.970
I don't like that. I'm going to go back. I'm going to try another one. It's a, it's amazing.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:06.100
It's amazing. Yeah. It is only getting better for the customer. So let me put it this way too.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:12.990
I think it's a loop things around is everything you talked about is we have this system of fast

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:23.710
releases of competition, of customer fickleness, uh, which brings it all back to how important it is

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:31.410
to have a team or someone on the team or a team with the goal of accelerating the achievement of

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:38.450
shippable quality. Right. Cause those things all that mission statement feeds into the system you

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:46.560
just described. Right. So what we described is a, is a, a business reality system. The other thing too,

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.040
is, is, is, as I set it off saying the world has changed and for test, what got us here

00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:01.340
isn't going to get us there. And what we're attempting to do is number one, create a guidance,

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:10.260
a vision, a North star, right. Um, document. And for you and me, it's not because we've gone through it.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:16.260
Yes and no, cause I don't think it's overly aspirational. It's not, but for a lot of folks

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.660
who are reading it based off of the feedback I've seen this last week, right. There's still,

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:26.820
there's still a lot of shock value in some of these. There are head nods on a lot of things

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.060
and to the end of being controversial, which I want to, I want to get to those in a minute,

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.340
but I want to finish this conversation first, this part of the conversation,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.820
the business is important. And one thing and going back to accelerating the achievement of

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:44.660
chipable quality and something that isn't reflected yet in the principles, which is

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.880
moving tests from a cost center to a cost benefit test is traditionally been a cost center. And I

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.960
mentioned, you know, books on reducing cost of software articles, papers test is a tax paid at

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:03.600
the end. The modern tester and modern testing, and in this system we talked about and accelerating

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:11.540
the achievement of shipable quality, there's a force multiplier that comes from applying

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:20.060
these modern testing principles that improve the business enough that the modern tester

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.100
is no longer attacks by any means. And not only are they not attacked, they're the opposite.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.890
That is, that is exactly what I think we're trying to do here.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:37.890
That is the big pendulum shift. It's moving from being a tax and a cost at the end

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:44.530
to something that makes the business more successful. And the other thing, and I think one

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:49.170
of the issues that we're going to hit as we roll this out and solidify it is folks are going to

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:57.440
view this as theoretical. I will say for me, I have done everything that I'm proposing in this.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.200
The talk I'm giving a test bash next week on adventures in modern testing.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.440
I gave a preview of it at a local special interest group and I've modified it reasonably

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.480
well since then for test bash. And normally I don't like to give the same talk over and over.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.340
In this case, given where we're at and the importance of this,

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:25.180
I have at least one other occasion where I am giving this talk. And that's going to be at PNSQC.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.580
I don't think that's announced yet, so sorry, in October. And then at the leadership conference in

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:39.340
New York in June, I am giving a workshop on managing the modern tester to talk about a lot

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.700
of these transitions, these organizational changes and how to get through them and what

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.580
it means to manage someone in an org like this. So I'm speaking at more conferences this year

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:56.780
than probably I ever have before, but more than I really want to. But I think it's,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.420
I feel like with what's going on with these modern testing ideas we're talking about,

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:06.860
it's the right time to try and get this word out and keep the momentum going. Because

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.820
what I love about this talk, and this is one of my goals I mentioned before when I give talks,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.740
I want to see some head nods, yeah I agree with you, and a few looks of shock.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.340
And I like being in that sweet spot because it gets people thinking.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.390
I don't disagree. Good.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:33.310
Right, when I went through this, like some of the feedback we've gotten is, hey, tone down

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:44.190
the controversy. And I'll say in a lot of places I don't agree with that because what I kind of

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:53.390
view it as, and I saw this at Microsoft when I went through this, is that right now is the

00:26:53.390 --> 00:27:01.150
opportunity. It was very clear in my head that what was going to get the traditional tester here

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:09.650
isn't going to move forward anymore, but that there was still time to save some of these people's

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:20.530
jobs. If I could get, convince them that there is a ticking time bomb, and if they acted now,

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:29.090
they could shift themselves to a better place. And to be clear, I totally forgot the point I

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.290
was going to originally make, so I'm talking about the talks, I want to come back to that.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.890
But I'm reminded first of a quote I use often from Ronald Heffetz in the book Leadership on the

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:45.170
Line. It says, leadership is disappointing people at a level they can absorb. And the shocking

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:52.940
things are just disappointing. My adventures in modern testing talk is of course filled with

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:59.420
tangents because that's what I do, but it's a journey. It starts off with the reflection of

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:06.380
the last few projects I've done and how what I've learned on those teams have led me towards a lot

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.900
of these modern testing principles. And then I talk about what modern testing is, and then

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:18.380
examples of how I'm walking the talk and doing those currently in my job and embracing change.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.940
In the very beginning, I have to give away the whole thing, basically say this is not a future

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.740
of testing talk, which are all theoretical, and I've given one before and they're all wrong.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:33.900
This is a talk about embracing change. And then it's all just stories, adventures, stories.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:39.840
I like, I'm not touting my own talk much, but when I watch talks, I like it when it's real

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.280
experiences. I hate talks that are all about theory. So I think it's really important that

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:53.460
at this stage, we are able to take the theory away from this. And what I expect is once we get

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.580
the principles sort of finalized, I think they will always be tweaked and edited,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:02.370
but they'll get pretty close after a while, is we should start, we'll start talking on podcasts

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.650
about stories that support the principles and what they mean. I and or Brent or both of us

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:13.570
kind of covered in that statement, we'll blog and write articles and give about individual

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:18.370
principles to show background to move that theory into these are real life examples of

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:28.210
what this means and what's different. Yeah. I don't like it. Again, I don't think what what

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:37.580
we're writing down is theory, but I do acknowledge it will be for several folks interpreted as such.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:46.100
Right. Again, I've I've I've done these. And again, I've seen enough head nods, we can get

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.540
stories from from the world as well. So I want to ask you a few questions for

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:58.800
sort of the fact, develop the fact here online. So question number one, these principles,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.240
as you guys have been discussing, and if you need to go review what the original ones were,

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.070
you can go look at the show notes for Episode 77. Pause your recording way, go get those. So

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:17.420
Brent, a lot of these sound like agile things that agile teams do. So why,

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:24.220
why are they called out separately in the principles of modern testing?

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:36.940
That is one of the foundational pieces that are important in modern testing. I mean,

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:42.860
as we just went through and talked, there's been a bunch of changes in the software world.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:50.140
I think agile and those agile principles are critical to it. In terms of the initial feedback,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:31:01.600
right, what we're trying to strike is we're trying to say, this is actually really important

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:10.560
in the test, the modern test context. I will just freely admit that in my in my own head,

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:19.760
some of the principles doesn't seem to have the recipe quite right yet. And it's more focused on

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:27.780
anything you could read from, you know, how to do Kanban and not sort of the, what does it mean to

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:33.620
the modern tester? Okay. So let me, let me lead that question into another. Yeah. So I agree.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.220
There are some of the principles which are like from the agile world, these are super important

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.260
because they help you accelerate the achievement of shipable quality and help the team adapt and

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:52.340
shift faster and better quality and more value to customers. Those things I think are worth calling

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:59.540
out. But then there's also an alignment. Yes. But let me, let me ask the next question, which is,

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:08.350
well, and then, so if you look at it that way, some of these sound more like a product or project

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:16.000
project manager sort of principles than a modern tester principles. That's going to be,

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:26.990
that's, I'll just say, one of the things that I'm, I'm thinking about is, is the question of

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:36.660
how do I describe crisply the role of the modern tester versus some of these other common

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:43.540
concepts, Scrum Master being one. Am I saying that modern tester is a Scrum Master? No. No.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.620
Am I saying a modern tester is a PM? No. Am I saying a modern tester is a dev?

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:55.810
Well, actually in that case, there might be an argument because I do think another thing that

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:02.850
we haven't fully talked about, but it kind of goes into the very last principle. And that is,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:11.580
as it comes to particularly code correctness, unified engineering team, in my view, is a vastly

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.580
better way to go. Yes, I agree. Having a engineering team is a much more efficient way to make

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:24.530
quality software and ship it quickly. And while we're talking about the noun modern tester,

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:31.250
I don't know, I don't, it's not clear in my head if I have a modern tester specialist

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:42.560
as a member of this unified engineering team. But it is absolutely clear that modern testing

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:51.760
activities are an active part of that unified engineering team. Yes, yes. And therein lies some

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:58.240
more confusion. So one thing I want to bring up on your last question is, as we've indirectly

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:06.060
mentioned before, the modern tester is a specialized in generalist. And they may wear that

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:12.620
PM hat sometimes. And that's, I think it's common for someone in what we're calling the modern tester

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:22.540
role to take on some project management, management ish tasks and responsibilities from time to time.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:32.510
No, I think we're saying that the lot of software has been developed with three individual disciplines.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:42.380
And while we're not making a statement around whether or not it's good to continue to have

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.580
three, I think one of the things that we're saying is we recognize that people operated in

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.460
that world today, and we're trying to help shift the change. But just like what we're

00:34:52.460 --> 00:35:00.270
saying is testing moves to dev for a lot of the work, right? Yeah, things are, it's going to shift

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:06.110
the interaction between a modern tester and the PM changes as well. And I'll just say one of the

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:17.250
things that I think a modern tester focuses on, or versus a PM as an example, a modern tester is

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:31.040
comparing and shrinking the hypotheses of the product, the assumptions, the guesses, aka

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.880
what you see in a PM docket with a list under the word requirements. Okay, these are all assumptions.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:48.140
The modern tester is going, okay, I am not only testing on the product's ability to deliver those

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:56.530
assumptions, but I'm testing on which of those assumptions are actually valid. So I do think

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.660
modern tester in this regard is a bit of an optimizer. Hey, we have these guesses on the product.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:10.900
Which of those guesses are correct? Which ones should we go all in on? I think one of their

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:20.020
roles is for an example is to inform the PM, who in this world is more of the intuitionist

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:28.900
dreamer, the guy who's trying to build new markets. Okay, that's a more, and I do view,

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.540
I may be downgrading the PM, but I do view that role is really important because I think the

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:40.670
modern tester and developer are working on removing waste while producing value. I like that.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:46.590
I think the PM's forward thinking. I think the PM's going, okay, once we kill this job,

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:52.110
once we kill this sort of product value, we can move into this other market that Dev and

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:59.460
test may not be focused on. They're trying to go, how do I build the business? Where the modern

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:09.310
tester is more around, how do I make the customers that are finding value with this stay? How do I

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:17.070
get them delighted? And what things aren't actually contributing to? Could you say the PM

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:22.190
role in that case is to build the business and the modern tester is to help or is to improve

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:31.790
the business? Is that too much of a summary? I would say, I like how you did that, but then

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:37.710
you made me think of architecture. And I'm actually thinking that the PM is sort of trying to design

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:46.880
the business. It's the modern. If you go back to architecture, yeah, it's the design architect.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.800
And then the modern tester, maybe the craftsman is making sure that the

00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:00.740
building is, the design is efficiently implemented. I don't want to go too deep into the metaphor

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:07.810
there because it breaks down pretty quickly. So I'm actually thinking of yet another one of

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:14.210
my heroes, which is Christopher Alexander. Of course. I know that name. Yes. And he was an

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:22.050
architect and he introduced to the world design patterns. Okay. And we've talked about it before

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:34.780
not going to go into it now. But he did two things. Number one, he showed how design patterns

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:42.590
improved the business, but his focus was around these things he called positive and negative forces.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:49.150
Because what he was trying to do was influence the happiness of the people who would live in his

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:55.550
designs. An example I use all the time is you don't install a toilet in the middle of your

00:38:55.550 --> 00:39:02.880
kitchen because no one's going to use that toilet. I don't think you need to go into the because.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:12.320
Well, yeah, but I think I think PMs are business designers. I think keeping the Christopher

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:21.940
Alexander example alive, like someone needs to notice which patterns are creating positive impact,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:29.630
which patterns are creating negative impact and drive the business to deal with those

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:37.870
in near real time. Unlike in the old architecture days where you had to have a full design up front.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:44.750
And this is one of the things that there's a kind of key change. You don't do big design

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:53.390
up front anymore. Right. You iterate. So there's the risk of being wrong is much smaller now.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:40:07.970
And I, but what that does is it creates a wide, a wide number of components. You have a lot more

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:15.870
options. It's a full time job to go through and say, which of these things do we improve in?

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:20.750
Okay. I want to fire off three more questions in the last 10 minutes here. If I can remember them

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:26.750
all throughout the discussion, the first is, okay, Brent, I'm bought in on modern testing.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:30.750
I get how the evolution works. It takes some experience to be a modern tester,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:37.950
yep. To be able to apply these things. How, as more of our people move into these

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:44.560
roles we're describing as a modern tester, what's the entry path then for new people in

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.520
modern time? I have some answers to this as well, but how do you, how do we then find more

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.760
people because modern testers grow from the test rank and they're growing into roles that are no

00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:01.060
longer test roles? Typically. How do we get new people into modern testing? What's the growth path

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:11.760
for a fresher as they say? I'll just be quite honest. I have been thinking about this a lot.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.780
I don't think I have a really solid answer. Part of me goes, you know what? This is a change

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.660
management role and this is a leadership role. I am not certain you can hire someone into this.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:33.940
And then another part is, you know what? One of the things that we're also saying is over time

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:44.820
we don't, over time this just becomes an activity that is assigned to a specialist.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:54.740
Right. And in that regards, it's, then you can hire someone new. I would start with hiring

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.300
dev or PM with traditional dev or PM skills. That's exactly where I was going to go. I think

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:05.060
I would add statistics to their training and I would add customer behavior analysis. And

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.060
yes, but I wouldn't be so prescriptive about that. You're not going to, they don't,

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.980
you're not going to grow it and nurture it like a plant. You're not going to go, okay,

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.260
you are going to be our modern tester. Here's how we're going to train you. And when you're done,

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.620
you'll be able to do this. I think I have known many, I would look, I would look, I have known

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:30.020
many developers who have, we hire them as a developer. They end up caring a lot about

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:36.260
quality and craftsmanship. And those people, even though they've never been a tester,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:43.780
would follow these modern testing rule principles without ever having heard them before. They just,

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:48.660
they're, those people will grow out of the existing people on our teams.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.940
Let me clarify.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:43:00.990
And I also think there's a, there doesn't need to be a modern tester on every team. In fact,

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:10.910
all, I can definitely see roles even in my org where someone, me or others, could just be a coach

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:17.390
of modern testing principles for multiple feature teams very easily, which is a different answer to

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.190
the question we asked, but you wanted to clarify something. So go ahead.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:27.650
So I agree with everything you just said. Like it's a reason why we're calling it the modern

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:33.890
testing principles, not the modern tester principles. Right. And if you look at our

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:40.210
last principle, we're, we're actually saying specialists with the title tester, we expect to

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:46.610
disappear. Yes. But what, so to clarify, I would not hire, include that line on, I know you're

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.050
interrupted, but we should include that line in the introduction for principles. These are modern

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:56.050
testing, not modern tester principles. Go on. Yeah. That clarity I think is noted.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:04.780
If I were hiring this person, I wouldn't be trying to hire this person directly. What I would do is I

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:14.930
would go, okay, what I want is someone who has the skills to work in this type of domain.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:22.800
So I would be attracted to people who had customer behavior, experience on their resume,

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:36.240
okay. Data stats, ML and dev. And I will say that one of the things that I've started having

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:41.600
conversations with my own team, like you and I are talking about, Hey, test is on its way out.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:51.790
I'm starting to see the beginning of the end of people in my role. ML work is suddenly become a

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:59.710
lot more commonplace. I think there's a generality there. The specialists, as we know, is a bottleneck.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:04.910
For sure. And we're starting to see with modern testing and with the democratization of data

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:11.070
science. Yep. We're seeing the specializing generalist and as a manager building a team,

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:16.350
you build the team of specializing generals with different areas of specialization within there

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.870
to help build the jigsaw puzzle of a good team. And that's how you build a modern test

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:25.310
100% agree. It may be one person with that big testing background, but it may be in the future,

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:29.710
more likely, it's a few different people that bring the different principles to the table on

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:35.890
the future team. Yeah, it is all about the team and it is all about what skills you have in the

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:41.730
team and how well you get the team members leveraging each other's knowledge instead of

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:48.370
trying to duplicate it. Right. So why call it modern testing? Why modern is next post modern

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:54.050
testing? Why is this modern compared to traditional testing? What's your, what's in my view, it's,

00:45:54.050 --> 00:46:01.330
it's, and I know the answer is, is it the fact in my view, it's simply, um, to force that comparison

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:10.100
between traditional someone else on a called it vintage. I, I kind of, I kind of liked that one

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:15.380
because it, it kind of gives a nice turn, but makes it sound really old. I heard someone else

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.140
call it Bass, Acre, 1990s testing. Yeah, that doesn't quite flow off the tongue. Not quite. Right.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:29.460
But the other thing I will, I fully realize we need to put this in, in our published documentation.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:35.340
Right. One of the key principles of modern testing is you constantly adapt.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:47.330
And as, uh, as new techniques and new software, uh, models come into play, we're going, uh,

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:54.290
we would hope that modern testing would persist by learning these things and incorporating into it.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:47:02.050
So it, it is in some regards, it is a living document. But if ever one of these techniques

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:09.490
comes into play that, that just essentially eliminates the need for, for, uh, testing in any

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:17.150
regard. Um, I think rightfully so, just like we're proposing traditional testing should be abandoned.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:23.810
So should modern testing. Yeah. And what comes next, that's going to be up to

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:30.370
whoever realizes this pattern and names it, I guess. Yeah. And like I mentioned earlier,

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:35.970
talking about the talk that I'm giving, it's not about the future. It's about embracing change.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:41.490
We could say in a way, modern testing is very much about that as well. It's not about defining

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:46.050
the future. It's about embracing the change that's going on and what it means to software quality and

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:52.580
soft, the software testing activities. It's about, I think it's more than embracing change.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:57.140
It's about it embracing and acting on that change. You know, the phrase,

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:04.740
when I embrace, I embrace deeply. So it acting is included. Anytime. Do you want a hug? Later.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:13.150
Anytime there is a change, it is also an opportunity. And what we're trying to do with modern testing,

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:21.410
and I, I mean, there's a lot of things in here and there isn't a single one thing other than

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:27.330
accelerating the achievement of ship of equality that binds it together. Um, but what we're

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:37.090
trying to do is saying, Hey, this is happening. It's not a matter of, of if it's a matter of when

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:44.130
it's happening, that the momentum is there. And when the universal tipping point happens,

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:52.420
it's going to happen fast. Now we see an opportunity for people who start preparing

00:48:52.420 --> 00:49:00.830
themselves for that time. And you don't have to, it's, it's not like you're not going to gain value

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:08.750
out of it immediately once you start doing this prep. But the people who I, I view it as the

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:14.350
people who really see this light, see that this tipping point is in fact coming and starting to

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:23.700
prepare for it. They're going to thrive when it hits. Yep. One of the controversial points,

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:27.060
there's, there's one, there's two controversial points in the principles. And again, you can go

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:32.340
read them on episode 77 show notes. There's one around where we may reduce or eliminate

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:37.540
the need for modern for, for the testing, a specific testing role. Uh, that one's like,

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.780
Oh, my job. But we'll talk about that and explain that about breaking change. That one was

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:46.180
obvious, obviously controversial, meant to be controversial to get people thinking.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:52.660
There's another one around the customer. And we said that something close to is in constant

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:59.300
evolution. The only, the customer is capable of evaluating the quality of the software.

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:03.860
And traditionally testers have thought about like, I am the customer. I'm the protector of the

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:11.620
customer. And, but both Brent and I believe very strongly in this one and we've had pushed to

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.420
remove the word quality and call it value. And we both kind of feel like quality is the right word

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:22.480
there. And I'm going to bounce this off some folks at test bash as well. We're going to get a bunch

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:29.040
of feedback. And as a teaser, the first ever AB testing cliffhanger, we're going to dive deep

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:35.810
into that next time on AB testing. I'm Alan. I'm Brett and we'll see you next time.
