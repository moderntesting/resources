00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.120
Hi everyone.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.120
Howdy.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.120
I'm Alan.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.120
I'm Brent.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.040
We call him Baby Brent today, but he's here with us.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.040
Baby Brent.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.880
Baby Brent, because in our previous attempt at starting the podcast, you pissed me off.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.120
Now you're Baby Brent for a while.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.300
What episode are we, Brent?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.370
Sixty.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.370
Gosh, dang.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.010
Sixty, that's awesome.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.010
Sixty.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.010
Nice round number.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.810
If we were a professional podcast, we would have like a special episode every fifth or

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.090
tenth episode, but Brent, are we a professional podcast?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090
We are not.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.330
Or are we?

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.970
Because we have, if you got into the website, gone to our Slack channel, gone anywhere else,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.970
we have a logo.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.370
We have a new A B testing logo that isn't something A, Alan, made into word three years

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.570
ago.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.690
I don't know that the logo, so first off, the logo is quite cool.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.890
The logo is very cool.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.890
But I would argue, right, we still only have three listeners.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.290
The logo is just lipstick on a pig.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.090
Fake it until you make it.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.290
But if you like it, it was done by a wonderful Alexa Horn, who also did my Angry Weasel logo.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.890
And so if you're interested in any graphic design work, I'm happy to send you her way.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.050
It's great, easy to work with, great job.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.650
I'm very, very happy.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.650
And that was not a paid promotion.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.650
Nope.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.650
I have in my hand as well some stickers that Alan has produced.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.650
Designed also by Alexa.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.650
Designed also by Alexa.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:59.870
It's intended for, if you're one of the three, we have soon to come the ability to proudly

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.870
emblazon your laptop.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.870
Or any place you want to put a sticker.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.870
Right.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.100
If you are a member of the Slack channel, Alan has already given those folks the opportunity

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.100
to get one of these stickers sent their way.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.100
If you want to join the Slack channel, just contact me.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.100
I can send you to Percy on Twitter, but I can just take care of it.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.100
I'll get you set up.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.100
And then in that, if you're familiar with Slack, there's a channel called I Want a Sticker.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.100
And if you want a sticker, you go to I Want a Sticker, put your address, and you get one sent to you.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.100
Pretty cool.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.100
And soon to come, we'll open this up on the website.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.100
We'll figure something out.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.130
Yep.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.130
We'll get our little A B testing shop going.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.290
But the process of getting the new logo first off, I am extremely happy with it.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.290
Me too.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.580
And the process of it was a lot of fun.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.580
It was.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.580
It was.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.580
I don't want to do like the total Alexa fanboy here.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580
But same with the Angry Weasel logo.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.580
She joined the Slack channel.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.580
She listened to the podcast.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.580
She got an idea of who we were and then used that for inspiration.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.580
And we bounced ideas back and forth.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.580
It was a super collaborative, really awesome experience.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.580
It was.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.580
It was.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.580
Okie dokie.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.580
So you know how else we aren't professional?

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.580
Well, we're riddled with ADHD.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.580
The equipment always fails.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.580
No.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.580
Well, it's because we're in this crappy Microsoft building where the power outlets don't work.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.640
How about you pay your bills?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.640
So we have this.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.640
We always make a nice little Kanban to do list agenda spur of the moment on the whiteboard.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:54.640
And I realize walking in here as with as much spit and vigor I left leaving 59 ready to continue it.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640
I don't feel very prepared today.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:06.640
But I think that'll probably change as soon as Brent says something that there's like a magic word or phrase you'll use that'll set me off and we'll be back off to the races again.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.020
Fugle horn.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.150
That's not it.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.150
What is a fugle horn?

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.150
I don't know.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.150
I know what a flugel horn is.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.150
Ok, that one.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.690
I don't know what that is either.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.690
Hey, I want to put this out there for all of the three and your friends.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:39.690
If you have a friend who can breathe and whose first name starts with the letter B, I will be accepting applications for someone I can stand.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.870
Oh gosh.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.870
Alright.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.870
One thing I want to talk about.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.870
We did negative one.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.870
So rather than reorder, we started going backwards.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.870
So all anger weasel.com, WAC A B testing where we host this the podcast.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:06.870
I put a I'm drawing with my hand, which is useless on the podcast, but a little web submission form where you can submit a mailbag request.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.870
No need for an email address.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.870
No need to join the slack challenge.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.870
I have a question for these fools.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.870
Just go throw it in there.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.870
So far I put it up unannounced and I've we've had three submissions to her spam.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.870
And one was a regular question, which will probably get to next week, but keep those coming in.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.870
If we get a lot, we'll just do an all mailbag show, which we have done once before, right?

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.870
Once or twice.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.870
Yeah, maybe.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.870
Wow.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.870
Yeah.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:43.900
But this is not technically an all mailbag show, but Brent has insisted that we start off with the mailbag.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.040
Yes.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:06:00.100
So we have been recently talking about what a tester's role is.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.100
And that Alan is what that could have been the magic word.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.190
Sorry.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.190
Go on.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.190
Right.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.450
So what's the testers role, Alan?

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.450
It depends who you ask.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.450
Ask 10 people, get 11 answers.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.450
Yeah.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.450
What's the testers role, Alan?

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.450
Accelerate the achievement of shippable quality.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.450
Thank you.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.280
Boom.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.280
I said, yeah.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:34.280
And Michael Rocha on the Slack channel asked, is it now I have to be, is it Rocha or Roca?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.460
He'll go with one of those.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.460
All right.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.520
Sorry, but the question is the important part.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.520
He's asked, can we break down what is accelerating the achievement of shippable quality?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:58.520
Now, last episode, we, towards the end of it, really started to get on a rant on, on,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.520
ish a little bit, on sort of what our view of modern testing is.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:14.650
And when considering this question, as well as how we ended the last episode, it occurred to me that in my mind, yeah, they're very much aligned.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:20.380
Can I share with you, Alan, sort of the thoughts on

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.380
what I think answers this question?

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.380
Well, because you asked to know.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.510
Okay.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.510
All right.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.510
So then on to topic two.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.740
All right.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:44.410
So at a high level, if we break down accelerating the, of shippable quality, as well as sort of merge it with modern testing,

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:56.340
the very first and important tenant on this is quality is only defined by the customer.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.340
I agree with that.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:04.660
It is not defined by the PM who wrote the requirements.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.660
And, but it's, let's just dive into all this stuff because, yeah, because the, I agree with that.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:16.820
But the way I've put that before is software quality is only what's perceived by the customer.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.820
That's fine too.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.820
The only reason I pause, I pause your definition is the customers don't know what quality is.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.820
So they can't actually define it.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.520
Right.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.520
So it's, so you have to read between the lines a little bit.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:38.520
And it's, I just know that whatever you do, whatever the way I've put this in the past is customers don't give a shit if you have 90 percent code coverage.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.520
Nope.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.520
Nope.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.810
Well, and I think I put that in a presentation.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.810
I, oh, I remember I gave a tangent time.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:51.810
I gave a presentation on metrics once and I, and I, I made a big deal out of complaining that customers don't give a crap about those things.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.810
But moved into, of course, telemetry and things like that.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.130
Anyway, back to the Brent show.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.130
To piggyback further on that one.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:08.130
So if quality is only defined by the customer, then what is quality in their point of view?

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:19.410
And I like Tom Popendike's guidance on this is quality is a problem solved.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:27.860
I don't want to go too deep on the, the, my view on the tenants of what makes up quality.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:33.860
If people want to hear that or they want to have a view to it, they can go to my blog site.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.860
I've written that up.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:44.890
And many, many, many philosophizing on the internet around what is quality, which we don't want to go into.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:58.080
Now, another point of the story where I came to this conclusion was, was back in the day and having multiple arguments within Microsoft around Google and Bing.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.080
Google, when it first came out, just shipped bugs all the time.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.080
And a lot of the people, this is when I was still in a test role, a lot of the people that I would be talking to,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.080
what had the approach that Google was just a fad.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.080
Look at all the bugs they shipped.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:29.820
I'm like, if bugs were important to customer quality, then I would be expecting to see Google stock price tank, not a skyrocket, which is what we're observing.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:47.070
It's essentially Google was, was an innovator in terms of solving a problem with respect to search and, uh, an innovator on leveraging their data instrumentation to identify what is causing the most customer pain and reshit.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:53.070
The second tenant that I'll say that this piggy backs.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:11:04.070
So don't you want, I know you have some, and I always worry when Brent writes things out because, because then Brent just kind of reads and we get lost, but I want to talk about that one.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.070
Okay.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.870
Because I think.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.870
Go ahead. Theoretically, this is your podcast too.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.470
I was going ahead.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:23.470
The visualization I came up with, like, it's like our brains have an idea we're going with, but these squirrels and trains and things go by and we look at them and go, oh, look at that.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.470
That's cool.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.470
Back to this. Yes.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.860
The reality is though, it is cool.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.560
Yeah.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560
Squirrels are fun to watch.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.560
They are. You mentioned a quality is problem solved.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.560
Yep.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:45.560
And bugs can get in the way if they block you from solving that problem or make solving that problem unpleasant or more difficult than it should be.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.560
Yes, for sure.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.560
And we all know that software ships with known bugs.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:12:02.620
Well, you do now and some of those do block problem solved, but many of them they never customers never see is a bug that a customer never finds a bug.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:10.840
The tree falls in the forest and no one hears it doesn't make a sound is a bug that the customer never finds a bug.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840
They never ever see it.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.840
Yeah, it's a bug.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.970
Is it one that we care about fixing?

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.970
No.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.970
All right.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:19.970
Depends on your definition.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.970
OK, I'm good with that.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.060
All right. Go on, Brent, with the rest of your list.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:41.770
In my view, so combining accelerating the shipment or the achievement of shipable quality and modern testing that one of the tenants is shipping and iterating is the best way to get to shipable quality.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.060
Say that again.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.060
Shipping and iterating.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.060
Correct.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.060
Is the best way to get to shipable quality.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:57.220
You will initially ship something that you know is not shipable quality.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.220
So my goal in working on a team that was shipping every week, I'm a little bit.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:17.720
So in the past, when I've worked on products that have shipped frequently, the goal was always not to make it bug free, not to nor to try and shove a bunch of crap in.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.720
The goal was simply ship as often as we can, but every release is better than the one before.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.780
Yes.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:33.540
Defined as defined how more, more customer value.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.280
Yes.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.660
I'm glad you asked that because that's really important.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.660
It's like, what is better and more value?

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.660
And that could be another feature.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:47.660
It could be some important bug fixes, either visible or invisible bug fixes.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.950
I think it's important to differentiate.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:14:00.950
The visible bug fixes can feel much more minor because it could be like a five or ten or fifteen minute fix on the engineering side.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.950
But they make a lot of difference in fit and finish to the customer.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:12.950
Whereas you need to balance those with fixing the infrastructure type things like fixing performance issues that may be subtle for customers.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.950
But the architecture change may be better in the long run.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:22.950
So you need to balance both the invisible and visible bug fixes and give them value with like, here's a new feature.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.950
Value isn't 50 new features.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.950
Value isn't just fixing 50 bugs.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:37.720
I want perceivable customer value improvement with every release can be subtle and they may not see it because it's so gradual because they're shipping so often.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.720
But that's always my goal.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.720
And then you need to end if you ship 50 times a year and every release is better at the end of the year, you should have a.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.720
Fairly good product.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720
Yeah.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.010
Yeah.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:57.330
I mean, the trick in those things is figuring out how to measure it.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.900
It's not the trick.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.380
It's to me it's it's it's the fun part.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.380
It's it's for sure.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:14.380
This is I know we're going to talk about modern testing in a little bit, but this is sort of a shift in what testers do.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.380
And maybe the test rule.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:21.380
What are some things testers do to accelerate the achievement of shipable quality.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.580
One of the things we do is to figure out how to measure those things.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.580
Yes.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.610
Yeah.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:34.670
I mean, let me so let me quickly go through what I think is the next most important tenant on this one.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.670
And let's just die deep under the modern.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.670
Sure.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.670
Sure.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.670
Sure.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.670
I just I think the train went by a squirrel on top of the balloon.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.670
I just kind of went with it.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.620
Yeah.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.780
I'm envisioning that now.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.780
What color balloon.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.780
Brett don't think of an elephant.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.780
I'm like look at the squirrel.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.780
He's carrying a balloon.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.780
All right.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.780
Calendar time.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.850
So the phrase is talking about acceleration.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.200
Right.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.200
So if we're talking about how do we get to shipable quality.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200
How do we iterate.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200
How do we measure.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.200
What is what is what is the key source of signal that we're going to measure.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.200
And that's some sort of heuristic around customer satisfaction customer quality.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:30.620
Then you got to realize that calendar time is the single most important resource to any engineering team.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.620
Correct.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.620
It's a clock on the wall.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.840
There's a clock on the wall.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:45.000
And there has to be a sense of urgency a sense of not just velocity that the customer is going to be able to do.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
But there is velocity.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:09.130
That's why it's acceleration because as you learn more your competition is learning more and you have to take that knowledge and feed it back into the system to be able to scale and increase the rate at which you're adding value to the customer.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.130
Yes.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:16.160
Now this is in particular in the services world.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.450
Right.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.450
This is one of the key problems in the modern world.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.450
It is particularly relevant in the services world.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.450
There is this item called switching cost.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.510
And no matter what you publish to the web.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:36.640
You have a competitor and your customers can go to it near instantly.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.640
Everyone does free trials.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:45.640
There's no onboarding costs for for most of these assets.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.640
It's really hard to be a monopoly in the service space.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.770
You only win by being better.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.770
Circle back to the customer quality.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:03.340
Now let's talk about modern testing in this light.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.340
Maybe a little bit.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.880
I've been thinking just about.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.880
I've been thinking while you've been talking.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.880
One of the reasons I think we have such healthy competition and so many.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:25.460
I'm going to give an example in a second across so many different things that we use something interesting.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:35.460
I've just come across tonight and I am pairing it with what you're talking about is quality is problem solved is why are there.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.460
I'll ask this rhetorically.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.460
Why are there six at least or 10 different solutions to solve my problem.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.710
Because all of our problems aren't the same.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.710
They're not.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.710
And it's interesting.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.710
So one story I'll share is I am.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.710
I do not miss outlook at all.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.220
It's very full features.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.220
Lots of lots and lots of features but very slow very much a pig and not that much fun to use.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.220
So when I left Microsoft I mail it.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.220
Unity is all Gmail based but I kind of like having a male class.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:14.220
I wanted a unified male client because I have four different male accounts I use fairly frequently.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.220
I'm not going to list them here but there's four and I want a unified male client.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:25.220
So I looked in there were half a dozen or so and some were paying some were free and I tried them all out and found the one that solved my problem.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.220
And I love it.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.670
It's been great for me.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.670
Just yesterday I was having some problems.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.670
So that's one example everybody's and somebody will say that doesn't work for me and that's fine.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.670
It's really cool.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:41.670
This is where this is why none of those programs will ever become a monopoly.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:42.670
I was having some problems with Evernote.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:49.670
I was looking for alternatives and coincidentally somebody who I've met and talked to a lot over the past.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.670
I met him when I say Yahoo and then he went somewhere else and then it went somewhere else.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.670
And now he's been it.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.670
He sent me a DM.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.670
He's at Evernote said I'm going to solve your problem.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.670
So a little little side tangent on the power of the network.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:05.670
But I got a lot of great suggestions on alternatives.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.670
One's practically an Evernote clone and others are even lighter weight.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.670
And of course there's one note from Microsoft.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.670
But again I'm not avoiding Microsoft.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.670
I'm avoiding fat things.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:25.670
I prefer to work in a web browser most of the time and I honestly I think the web browser experience and all of the other ones is better than the one note web experience.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.670
One note as a desktop app it's actually pretty fantastic.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.670
It's just a lot for what I need.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:36.670
It just made me I was thinking about as I've looked for like a new tool a new code editor.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:42.670
Why are there 16 different code editors you can use because they solve problems for different people in different ways.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.700
Well there's two reasons for that.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:56.700
Right. And we had this problem back in the day when essentially when you and I first met like one of the problems that was dominant around there.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:05.700
You bring 10 testers in a room asking to build a unified test harness.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.700
Oh God.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.700
You would walk out with at least 12 different designs.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.900
But none of those really could claim problem solved.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.900
No it's in a problem.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.900
The problem is because or the reverse.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:42.460
So we used to have a very vibrant internal tool submission system and multiple times I would find a tool that did 80 percent what I needed but I didn't have source code access.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.460
I would ping the owner and they would say no I can't add that feature for you.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.460
And if you were lucky and they were still at the company.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:22:11.170
Yeah. And because I worry about the code base morphing into two different versions I won't give you the source code so you can add this feature and because I'm busy I won't give you the source code and allow you to submit a check in.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:23.170
This is idiocy. The point of the story is the reason why there's multiple versions is a lot of times there's a current solution and someone realizes you know that there's one other thing I need and no one does it.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.170
And then they often get forced to rebuild from the ground up.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.170
I think it's different though and I want to get to modern testing.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.170
I think it's different.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:37.170
I mean internally at Microsoft especially and granted they're much better now at sharing and consolidating.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:47.170
But at that time it was more about I mean there was a checklist item on the career stage profile or latter level at the time for like a senior you've written a test harness.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:53.170
So there was a lot of career advancement motivation more than solving the problem.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:23:06.170
I think when with a code editor or a mail program or a note taking application I think the founders of those companies they I think we can solve this problem better than anyone else has.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:25.710
Or at least in a different way and they're going to and they create those things for that reason as a founder of a company or if I have an idea that already exists I'm not I think it's ridiculous to think I'm going to take over the market from all my competitors.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.710
Every note never set out to order to take over the world from one note.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:34.710
There's a whole bunch of people that need to take notes that I think our solution will be better for.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.710
Same thing with mail bird by mail application with sublime text.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:44.740
They solve the problem in a way in a slightly different way that's going to work better for some chunk of people and that's where their business comes from.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:59.100
I think at when you're talking about writing a test harness it's not they're not doing it for that reason that the reason people internally would write a test harness or a tool like that or a data pipeline crap is.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.100
Have I said here before that I'll drink here but the data pipeline is the new test harness for sure.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:19.310
So anyway although at least it in my neck of the woods that's tapering way back much faster.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:26.310
No I think yeah I agree. Yeah but you get where I was going so let's pop the stack a little bit.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:33.310
I could elaborate there but you know what I mean. Let me let me let me piggyback off of that and say great.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:39.500
What started with piggybacking is pushing onto the stack. Yeah. Hold on. Do you have a go to coming up. Shut up.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:45.500
Calendar dime is critical like. Oh yeah. We were talking about. We learn.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:58.500
We mean we learn this fascinating email story because I stated calendar time is critical and a big part is switching costs is super cheap.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:13.690
Alan can explore all of the email clients plus the other 50. He hasn't played with yet in easily a span of a day. Right. Correct. Now that's today's world.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:21.910
But what's the world we're heading into. And you can see this progression if you if you look at where we came from.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:31.910
So web 1 0 right. What was that all about. It was about connecting together knowledge content.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:40.620
Right. It was created primarily in colleges so that people could link together ideas.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:26:00.380
Sure. Web 2 0. Right. What was that. That's typically where the social media is. It's now also linked together not only the ideas but linked together people. Yes. Ideas that aren't written down might be a way of putting it.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:21.820
Great. Now web 3 0 mobile is the is the place where we're at right now. And if you look on the web people are already talking about the beginning of the end for smartphones.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:48.880
Right. The mobile situation is by some people's belief is beginning to already plateau. Right. So what was the point of this aspect is hey you can now connect with knowledge whether it's being linked or whether it's between the ears of your peer group anywhere you want to be.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:27:01.810
The next thing that's that's that is is already starting to be in flight is dynamic context.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:29.820
It's essentially Allen goes to whatever the hell he wants to go to and he says I want emailing services and in an ML world the system would just go oh okay I know from how Alan's uses pattern that these are the features he's likes.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:52.350
We have connected the dots to you like you need these features. These are all the rest APIs that that exist across the web space. We know how to integrate it together. We know from prior interactions.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:28:03.580
This is the the the UI that we need to tunnel all of this stuff too and it just works right now that seems nearly impossible today.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:11.580
A lot of it doesn't because I think machine learning could definitely look it's to be different for every person going back to everyone has different needs.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:31.700
There is easily you could look at the way I handle email the wet what I reply to what I delete what I ignore wouldn't take too much machine learning based on my behavior patterns to be very very accurate on predicting exactly what my optimal experiences.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:59.750
I think the next most important advancement that will exist in the testing world is breaking away from least common denominator solutions like the next big thing to come isn't is an active expectation that a vibrant personalization of what I as an individual care about is what's important.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:09.750
That's really interesting because we've heard forever and I've said it for myself when you try and solve all the problems for everyone you solve none of the problems for no one.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:33.750
I said paraphrase on there's many paraphrasements of that. Yep. But it gets away from that says we can use machine learning AI whatever and we can automatically customize your experience with these your software experiences to work the best for you based on how you work and what your problem is go back to problem solved.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:30:02.580
It's automatic machine driven customization of solving your problem. Yeah. Now easy the machine. How do you test that. How do you test that. And I know the answer. How if you're testing prowess is still based off of 80 percent based off of the learnings you gathered from 1998.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:20.930
How you gonna get there from here. It's not using your brain instead of 10 year old techniques. What is your test automation suite in that world. Actually a very good question because I ranted a little bit on this on Twitter recently. Yep. Because of all this.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:35.930
God I say the word the testing and checking stuff and I think to be successful in testing you absolutely have to be a systems thinker and be able to see the whole picture and know how it all fits together.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:49.930
I see a lot of narrow mindedness in some testing approaches or narrow narrow narrow mind that it sounds like an insult. I'll say narrow views. Many people in testing view test automation as pure test functionality and.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:31:06.930
It passes or it fails. Actually many people view test automation as UI testing and you do some actions that passes or it fails. I think and I think about most of the automation I've written I've written very little pass fail automation. I've written a lot of tests.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:29.930
I'll call them tests for now and we'll discuss that exercise the system in some way and then when they're done I examine the system in order to figure out if what I did change the state easiest example is all create and delete a thousand objects and then I'll check memory heat fragmentation etc and see if the cleanup things worked.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:49.050
Is that automation or is that a tool. The answer is it doesn't freakin matter. So I think when you're looking at and jump ahead here the answer is not. There's no there's no pass fail automation you're going to write for a system that Brent has described.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:32:04.050
It's because it's customized how do you tell it's customized. Well I'm going to. I'm going to write a eye to analyze Brent's brain and based on the output of that I'll create an Oracle that tells me whether this is no I'm not going to do that. That's stupid.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:33.590
That's stupid. I am going to go back how do I know I have to ask these questions. This is the fun part I mentioned earlier. How do I know that I'm solving your problem effectively and what can I measure what sort of analytics or instrumentation can I add that may tell you if there is if Brent is trying to do the same act for some examples and we can we could brainstorm these a lot.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:56.590
I want to know how quickly he solves tasks. I want to know how many tasks he tries to do multiple times. I want to know that that made me think of something else but I'll come back to it. I want to know how often does he use the system. I think if he comes back to it a lot he's finding it useful. I'm going to brainstorm a whole bunch of that stuff. I'm going to work. I'm going to design experiments.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:09.590
I'm going to work which ones don't but it's all about analyzing not just Brent but for every single user out there what are some ways I can measure whether or not there is business or customer value from this and that's my testing. That's my testing.

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:17.590
I had so I've actually had some experience similar to the world I'm forecasting.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:39.520
So I've mentioned multiple occasions my time in Bing and one of my mentees at that time also ended up working in Bing and before I joined he wanted to meet because he really respected me. He knew me from from my test management roles.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:50.840
And he was a little surprised to hear that I was moving into a dev role but he wanted to pull me aside and said look don't come here and I'm like what why.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.160
And he said bugs don't matter.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.420
And now he was a fantastic tester.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.420
But his view was his job was to find bugs.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:15.600
And in the world where everything changes and there's an ML driven a bug you find today just automatically magically fixed the next day.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.050
Right.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:43.650
He would find that he would open bugs like he had done in prior situations and it just wasn't worth Dev's time to investigate what they needed to understand what the services they needed from their testing at that time was what's the systemic bug.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:51.650
Like what are we doing wrong such that this bug appeared not what is the bug.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:56.650
That's an action you can take that does accelerate the achievement of shipable quality.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.710
Yes.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:06.710
And not that entering a bug doesn't if it's a risk to that goal to that goal of that role little rhyme there.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:11.710
But yeah you want to take we need to look at taking larger actions.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.420
Yes now.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.420
Yes.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:26.800
The other thing I want to talk about and then I want to spend some time and quickly go through what we think on a detail focus and testing is different.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.800
OK.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800
Tell me what to do.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:45.800
One of the things I want to say is that in the world that we're in today and especially in the world that we are going into I am going to state that the idea that the test job is to provide information is dead.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800
OK.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800
That is dead.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.800
Yeah I have the I think you've didn't I.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.060
I've pushed back on that before myself anyway.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.060
We talked about that on the on.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:04.060
I owe the three another shot because I mentioned that an episode or two ago as well.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.060
Yes.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:23.060
I want to say that so there is a model I am working this through for a presentation I'm doing in my job to explain the maturity phases of data and I realize given these topics that it it it falls here.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.060
Right.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:32.060
And that model is you collect you inform you recommend and you act.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.060
Now that's a maturity model.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:47.380
So if if if you are a inexperienced in testing then yeah maybe what you're trying to do is figure out how do I get the information so that I can inform others.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:37:16.060
But information is needed for a decision making process and what for the world that we're going into where we are trying to be experts in customer quality and experts in terms of adjusting the system to to make better code and reduce the number of times we need to iterate to achieve shipable quality.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:23.060
You have to be a master of recommending the next action to take.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.190
And I think that's the next step for maturity for sure.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.190
Yes.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:44.190
And just to hit a little bit on the tester as information provider I think again that model works when the test role is a completely separate and siloed and maybe even not even in the same org building or continent as development.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.190
Maybe that's fine.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:58.190
But if we look at I think modern testing involves a tester one who is so sorry to see a changeable quality being an embedded member being the quality and testing expert on a feature team.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:03.580
And I think in that role you cannot be just the information provider.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:12.580
It's it's for one just not pulling your weight but it's not leveraging your expertise to a to an extent that's valuable to the team.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:28.990
And number two in the world and the advancements that we are making on instrumentation and these ideas of a be testing in the cloud like if you are firm that that is test role and you aren't paying attention to what's happening.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:37.990
I am telling you right now today you are moments away from your business team realizing they can automate you away.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:55.440
If all of your role is to inform on what works and what doesn't once these guys realize you all you got to do is hook up an instrumentation stack and ship pilots and betas and hook in continuous integration.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.570
Your value proposition is over.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.140
And I can tell you that if I came in work for your company I could like that up in a month.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.240
It's not that hard.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:23.340
Pay attention if you think that that's what your job is. I think if for any knowledge work role any knowledge work role if you think what you do is only narrowly defined the same story holds true.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:32.660
Yeah I think any knowledge work and testers compare themselves to they think they're not knowledge work sometimes but it is it's like it's a creative role.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:43.660
It's a role that requires a specializing generalist a generalizing specialist a T shape persona tree shape so we ever want to call it if you are purely a quote functional tester.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.660
I know what that means but I've seen I've seen it written down before. Yes.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:54.660
But you have to be broad and I'm giving a talk and probably by the time this goes out it'll be tomorrow because this podcast would go out on Monday.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:11.660
The at the online testing conference on technical testing and what that means and at the plug is there only because like if you are only one thing and the talks really about how to be how to have some breadth in what you do and how to provide value to their team.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:26.660
In fact one of the points I'll make is that it doesn't matter how technical you are it matters how valuable you are yet you may need to be more technical to be more valuable and what technical means so box time is that you use the techniques of the craft.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:43.300
That's it. So you should have multiple things you can do to accelerate the achievement of shipable quality which in the way the world is moving means you're able to analyze and understand what the customer experience is.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.300
And if you can start by grepping log files that's the collection face.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:41:10.300
So the four phases collect inform recommend act and to Alan's point like if you are in this informed world and you are a technical tester by his definition great that's a useful skill set and I'm not articulating that the skill set is dead.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:34.420
I am articulating that the role of just informing using that skill set is dead. I fully agree. And this and the wisest and the smartest amongst you if you're in this world are going to start focusing on going to the next maturity level and say okay my technical skill set is now an implementation.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:42:00.710
It's an implementation detail no one cares what I need to do the way I add value is be the expert on leveraging this data to provide value bulls recommendations with proof like if we do this thing we will improve this thing that you care about by n percent.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:10.710
So it's data driven recommendations yes because that's the next place where you add value and where your specialty as assist greatly.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:29.940
Yeah and again it can be for those of you new to this it can be looking at like oh I wonder if any customers hitting this bug and you go to your Google Analytics and you look it up and you and if the data is not there you go recommend you add the instrumentation or analytics data to find out how many customers are hitting that or if you go.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:45.940
You really need to know these things go recommend that information is added them when you have the right information in order to make a conclusion based on data you can get don't just say here's the data recommend a solution that recommend make a recommendation.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:43:03.940
I'm just ranting on top of yeah but yeah you get it but the data is there that I don't want to make sure because I completely agree with Ellen's examples but recommend that you add instrumentation and bolster that with what they're going to get out of it.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:25.940
Yeah and as you have to frame your recommendations in terms of the ROI to the business and to be clear if I had and slight tangent maybe not tangent for test automators out there let's stop stop writing automation right you rather recommend it go write that analytics yourself writing adding those instrumentation points yourself is the new test automation.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:38.940
Yeah and that we've covered over and over and I know I know but I'm piecing it into this conference a test harness in my view in the new world is just a load generator all of your validation should be coming from the product instrumentation.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:44.540
Let's go quickly we don't do anything quickly but we'll go for it.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:44:13.760
So let's talk about something more tactical on what is modern testing. What's what's a key thing that that changes in my mind one key thing is code correctness is no longer anywhere close where someone of a testing skill set is useful to validate code correctness is much more effective.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.760
And the domain knowledge is within the dev team. They need to own that. Sure.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:29.760
And it may be a brief in a passing moment in building a team. Maybe it's a testers role to make sure it's being done. Then they're out of the way.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:40.820
When I look at I way I look at it is do you have not going to go into the agile quadrants but a lot of times it's the role of the testing quality expert to make sure it's all covered but absolutely not to try and cover the whole quadrant.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:56.820
Just one of those things that fits into it like I may need to coach my team and writing better unit tests. I may need to hook up some help them or recommend they hook up some static analysis tools or for code correctness recommend unit tests are needed to be done.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:10.820
But I'm going to recommend that hey the lack of unit test is causing us to have to constantly reshape this is causing resources. I'm just saying act provide the set of resources that brings us up and yeah.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:22.430
All I'm saying is the role of the quality and testing expert frequently includes making sure those things get done. Yes. But then it's not but it's never their responsibility to do those things.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:36.590
Yes, it's not their responsibility to do those things it may be their responsibility to make sure that they are done. Yeah, I think it is their responsibility to make sure they're done right and then going back to calendar time is the single most important resource.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:49.590
This this is that's the principle where I'm suggesting this like code correctness needs to be owned by the dev resources at this handoff to to to test.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:46:10.590
When when understanding how to do a unit test framework and how to do TDD or BDD is not that hard. Right. The the tester should not willingly pick up the codependency loop. We've talked about multiple times because that slows down and you're trying to accelerate.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:35.360
Two bug debt should be zero at all times. Yes bug debt is the single biggest cause of time being wasted in an engineering team. I agree. The second biggest one is dependencies but the number one is bug debt. So I have I'm not because I own like 50 zillion different services.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:59.130
They ever tell you my newfound definition of what services are unity. No, because it's traditional things that you and I think of like ads and analytics. But really it's any parts of unity that don't work when the Internet's down. Any parts of unity that don't work when the Internet is like the website. Anything that connects with anything like our anything in the cloud.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:23.480
Okay. So but so what that means they own a lot of desktop components too. And even in those couple down so far some to go working off zero bugs. If there are bugs active there are actively being worked on. Yes. So they are the bugs are basically on the Kanban board. They're being addressed and fixed. But otherwise they're either are there or they're not.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:52.740
You either have proof you need to fix the bug or you don't. If you don't you defer. When I got the team to really interesting they killed all these old bugs. The reactions were great. It's like I was really scared when we started this. It's like within like five minutes. I really felt bad killing all these. Now it's done. I feel pretty good. Yeah. I mean if they're important they'll come back. Anyway I wanted to show that little story. I fully agree. A bug removed from the database.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:48:22.220
Is easily 20 minutes. But I guess the point I wanted to make is a lot of teams doing just pure services. Of course they just bug comes in. They deal with it or they forget it. But I think it's absolutely an achievable goal for anything you're working on. I think it's it's part of I think it's part of modern testing is working from zero bugs all the time is part of how we ship. Yes. Absolutely. Automation. What do we automate. Not returning to the cloud.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:52.400
Not rhetorical. What do we automate. All the things that should be automated. A hundred percent of those. Yes. I don't automate anything that's pass fail functional testing. I don't want to automate. I'd rather I'd rather discover that through analytics. I want to or unit tester. We automate unit tests of course. Yep. That that actually is in my view the best high level answer. But we are not. Details of that depend. We are not in the world.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:49:23.260
We are not in the world where we we say we automate everything. Now unit tests. Yeah unit tests should be automated TDD type things where we're at a very low level code right as you write enough code. If you don't have unit tests to protect you then the is a very good chance that the integration in the

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:53.280
tracks between components will fall fall down or fall apart. That needs to be automated. But here's the deal. Dev does that. Of course. Yeah. Right. What other tests. So maybe the question is what do testers or testing quality experts automate. I hold it is no longer true. This this this dogma of we're tests we must automate. Or there's a whole role of I'm a test.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:23.180
Automator I'm a test automation engineer. What do we automate. What we automate up front is quite I mean the next drill downs we automate those things where the ROI of automating up up front is higher than the ROI of relying on our instrumentation systems to tell us where the problem is right now. That's very context sensitive.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:40.160
Yeah. The load tool I mentioned earlier I need to create a thousand ten thousand a million objects and delete them to make sure the system is going to handle this because over the course of a couple days in the real world this will happen. I want to do this tight loop so I can see if there's a problem before our customers eat after two days.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:51:00.920
You automate those things that would be critical failures cause data loss. Those are things that need to belong in a in a in a production or a preventative suite. You automate those things where knowing too late harms the business again.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:23.720
Calendar time is critical in this world. Got it. Right. But is that everything. No. You do spend your automation again much like what you were talking about the test harness that generates load. You spend your time automating validation off of the instrumentation suite.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:30.170
That's where your value really is in this new world is to understand.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:46.250
Here's a new term new data science the term for the podcast anomaly detection and you create these new signals you hook them up to anomaly detection is the is the current practice.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:56.260
Sure I get where you looking where you saying look we got all this instrumentation get all the signal I'm going to hook it up to ML to tell me where I need to focus my attention.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:04.530
Awesome. What's next tools tool building I think is the next big thing what tools do we build it. Yeah.

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:13.690
That I think that ties into the previous bullet pretty well. Depending on where you blur the line between a tool and a test.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:23.110
Well so first and foremost you do not build a test harness in today's world.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:39.490
No no there's a lot and a lot of things you don't build anymore. You don't like it's done it's out there you much like Alan's mail situation you go out and you find a test harness.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:45.870
If you think about what's the problem I need to solve yep and figure out what solves that problem for you the same thing.

00:52:46.310 --> 00:53:07.370
And there's a there's there is a solution out there for example we didn't talk about it looks like looks like our fine quality way of producing advertising may actually result in a in a sale for cobra ton now cobra ton.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:17.790
This is not intended to be a plug but cobra ton solves a big problem for for in the modern world problem people have right.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:37.230
It was next the last one the last one is knowledge sharing in community is critical in this world why because to reduce calendar time.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:52.980
You cannot rely on each individual higher coming aboard learning it soup to nuts every time they have to be able to connect.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.540
Very rapidly with the people who know.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:06.610
And I think it's also and that why of course was an elaborate why not I don't believe you why I think acceleration.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:22.130
Frequently requires innovation and innovation comes from ideas meeting each other and one of the most efficient ways for ideas to meet each other is through community and collaboration.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:35.390
But it's yes it's but it's also well it's it's probably the same thing I'll tell you that today in my job the number one thing that irritates me.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:52.200
Just is I know that I'm about to write code and it's going to take me about three hours and I know someone in this company has already written what I'm about to write.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:55:05.880
But I'm going to continue to write what I'm about to write because I cannot figure out how I find that guy I know that if I did he'd give me his coat.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:19.500
So what I want is in a world of in a world where maybe it's internal only because the code is proprietary but there are tools that have indexed and walked all the code.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:30.540
In the company and then as I'm writing the code figures out what problem I'm trying to solve and suggest snippets or blocks or functions from around the company.

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:48.400
Right but until we have that setting an expectation that you are not to know everything right but you accept for the index of who knows there's that sick feeling of I'm doing this work I know I don't have to I know I know it's been done before.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.260
But I have no way to know what I don't know so I have to write it myself.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:56:19.330
Yeah and then the other one the last thing I have on here is really more of a realization shipping small batches of independent code is in optimizing your test strategy around that in evaluating the customer quality around the small.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:37.790
Batches of code that are continuously shipping is absolutely the best way to accelerate and remove risk from your system interesting you mentioned that I know where is going to be one of our longer podcasts but I know of a team that was shipping a web service weekly.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:45.460
And they got some feedback from customers that said hey we're getting an update every week and it's and it's their buggy.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:57:00.600
And their response was OK will ship every two weeks my response would have been OK let's ship every day or figure or realistically figure out the what was going on there to slow down the right parts of the system.

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:15.060
To make sure they got a customer shouldn't let us a new feature shouldn't notice when they get these updates the fact that they were shipping they're getting more bugs never release made them think I think they took the wrong action I think it's.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:28.620
I think the problem just magnifies if you don't fix the root cause just decide you're going to ship every day that is a horrible decision because now what you have is you've given an additional week for PM's to add a bunch of.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:58.440
And it's not small batches I'm not attacking the problem right right it's a it's a very short sighted and very ill advised and it's going to snowball into further problems until they identify a root cause what I would do in that situation quit is I would say OK let's look at the customer feedback now let's go look at the telemetry and figure out how we detect how they are.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:11.400
How do we detect the signal that correlates to their feedback they say this constantly buggy so how do we detect this in our in our nation if we we look at.

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:20.480
The customer we talk to the customer that's actually something new in the modern world testers talk to the customer yeah they talk to the customer.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:31.940
And you figure out what path there is and you look at the instrumentation to figure out how you detect this number one number two you add instrumentation of things are missing.

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:45.230
Number three you release daily until you see the signals falling down your releases are only bug fixes and until you see that stable.

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:51.650
And it's that zero in there is what talk to the customer what do you mean by buggy.

00:58:53.340 --> 00:59:05.180
Absolutely I mean that was part of the talking to the customer and you want to look for what are the bugs we can detect in the signal and what are sort of.

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:15.750
Aesthetic preferences with the customer and the both are important but I'm imagining in your scenario buggy means things I don't know.

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:30.400
Slow or I actually don't type this it could mean it can mean it can mean a lot of things right but there are better modern approaches to this then taking the risk.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:45.650
In if there's anything that I could say that is to any business leader like it is I didn't expect it when I tried it out I was surprised.

00:59:46.430 --> 01:00:08.870
And then I now understand why like you dramatically reduce the risk of your product by having a strategy that that reacts to instrumentation and by shipping all of the time yes small batches for the win absolutely.

01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:13.110
All right so thanks for listening.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:19.200
Yes we appreciate that hey I am Alan.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.380
And I'm Brent see you next time.
