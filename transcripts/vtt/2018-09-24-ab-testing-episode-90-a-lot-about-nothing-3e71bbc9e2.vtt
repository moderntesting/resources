00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.730
Hello, everyone.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.730
Happy.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730
You all right, Brett?

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.970
Yeah, not enough coffee for you to already start hitting on me.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.050
Well, you know how things go when you're having fun.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.970
I'm Alan, and that's Brent, as you can tell.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.050
We're here for another episode of AB Testing.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.050
Number 90.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.050
Okay, so...

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.650
Hey, so what is the AB Podcast all about, Alan?

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.650
I...

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.650
It's...

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.650
I don't know.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.410
And to your financial report of political views, AB Testing is a podcast by Alan and Brent,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.330
and we talk about making great software.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.170
Sometimes it's about software testing, sometimes it's about data science and other fancy buzzwords.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.290
Software engineering, agile, leadership, most importantly.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.130
Lately, this thing we've been talking about...

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.130
Shift left.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.370
...nonstop, shift into my pants.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.920
Modern testing.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.520
And man, I got to tell you, it's weird.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.000
We've been talking about...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.760
We talked about the principles for a couple episodes.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.480
Then we deep dove into the principles for a while.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.880
And then we took questions that came up during those discussions for a while.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.340
And it's been a long time since we had a podcast where the topic wasn't specifically

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.940
modern testing, even though we always...

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.940
Will come up.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.100
For sure.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.740
But it's a little weird, as I was driving here this morning, there's a weird thing that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.710
happens if you don't live in the Northwest, in the tech center of Washington.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.350
There's a vortex where...

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.230
Maybe it's a vortex, I'm not sure, but you can tell how close you are to Microsoft

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.160
Campus by how bad the driving is.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.640
And there's a correlation, and maybe you can do the data science on this, it's expensive

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.960
cars driving poorly.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280
Oh my God, I must be near a Microsoft building.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.380
Are you sure it's Microsoft?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.800
I'm pretty damn sure.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.930
Because I think it's the tech center.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.250
It's not like there's a lot of other tech companies buried around here.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.250
They are in the Northwest, but around the Microsoft Campus, it's Microsoft.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.930
Oh, so yeah, if you come closer to the East side, yeah, it's definitely...

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.730
Yeah, as I get closer to the Microsoft headquarters...

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.130
There's Google on the East side as well.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.690
But they're up in Kirkland, they're not here in this epicenter.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.650
And they may drive poorly there too, but I can tell as I...

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.890
I'm fairly certain they do.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.450
All right, well, I want you to go do the...

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.650
And then I would also...

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.410
Do the proofy proofy data science stuff on that.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.450
Yeah, I will get right on that.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.970
All right, so that's my hypothesis.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.530
My hypothesis is that if I see an expensive car driving very, very badly, I'm near a Microsoft

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.130
building.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.970
I think it's also going to be heavily correlated to your latitude and longitude at that moment

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.180
in time.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.700
Because I think if you worked at or near Amazon and you had to drive there on a day-to-day

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.940
basis, you would find the same things.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.940
Perhaps, perhaps.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.260
Although that is also just because driving in Seattle blows.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.860
Near someplace that had...

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.060
Well, at least if you work there, you have a reasonable public transportation route to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.060
get there.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.190
Yeah.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.580
Okay, so anyway...

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.420
Which also blows.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.740
For our next number, we'd like to play the soothing sounds of boss gags.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.290
Okay, go ahead.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.810
Okay, we have...

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.810
It's weird.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.570
We have sort of an agenda on the board, but we're not going to do it right away.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.370
Well, maybe not in that order.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.090
Actually, in terms of soothing sounds, like really buzz?

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.830
I was trying to pick something that I didn't like in the 70s.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.830
Oh, okay.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.830
Fair enough.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.830
It was sarcastic.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.830
Yes, it was.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.550
I'm like, why would you pick that?

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.550
There's so many better...

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.550
Okay.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.630
I immediately started thinking of Miles Davis.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.820
I like Miles Davis.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.780
That's because he's awesome.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.100
Well, really, he did all these relaxing, cooking, all these albums with this great band and

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.500
John Coltrane.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.180
Those are the best.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.180
People always go to the mainstream.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.100
They go, oh, I'm into Miles Davis because they have Kinda Blue.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.760
I go, fine.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.640
Check out the better stuff.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.040
Kinda Blue's good, to be clear.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.120
But relax and cook in all, which I just said before, but that whole series of stuff.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.520
Remember there, at that time, putting out an album, they'd put out like three a year,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520
four years sometimes.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520
That's impressive.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.560
So these guys in different bands, all the time.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560
I saw it.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.560
They were great players.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.560
They could improvise.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.160
Record companies were making most of the money from that.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.120
Those recordings are so good.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.220
Anyway...

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.110
How about Leon Redbone?

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.830
Never was much into Leon.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.110
I introduced him to my...

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.270
I think there's really only a couple of songs.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:39.210
I introduced him to my son the other day and he looked at me like, what is wrong with you?

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.610
Oh, my daughter and I had a weird moment that we don't speak of anymore, but we actually

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.140
found out that sometimes our musical tastes overlap.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.420
I was listening to something and she goes, wait, I like that song.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.380
I said, all right, let's just move on.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.320
To be clear, she listens to a lot of stuff I don't like.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320
She's into K-pop.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.970
I'll just leave it there.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.970
What did I do wrong?

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.020
I was just like, oh, I have that on my playlist.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.660
I could annoy Alan right now.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.180
Oh, God.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.660
Some of those songs is extremely fun to keep on your...

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.460
What is it?

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.540
K-pop band 21, I think, or something?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.540
I don't know.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.500
They have the song, I Am The Best.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.980
That sounds like a Pokemon song.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.980
Pokemon song.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.980
Don't most of them...

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.980
Yeah, shucks.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.980
Okay.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.660
But any time my middle-aged son, or not my middle-aged, but my teenage son, middle son...

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.140
Fred's so old he has a middle-aged son.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.260
No, I kind of combine middle and teenage inappropriately.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.800
Wait, what did you do in a pro...

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800
Never mind.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.360
Any time he's misbehaving, I could throw that one up, or pretty much anything from Taylor

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.300
Swift immediately...

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.380
Don't be harsh and untate.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.380
I'm not.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.380
She's fantastic.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.520
I find her music extremely useful.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.420
Say what you will, that woman can write a pop song.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.980
So on that front, it's actually interesting because my son, the same son, he's now at

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:52.300
a point where he's starting to express that he likes dad's music more than dad.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:08:00.180
So he'll find some obtuse band from the 80s or the 90s, and he'll go, yeah, this freaking

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.180
rocks.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:07.840
I'm mostly into what used to be called alternative rock.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.340
Our local radio station, The End, is mostly what I would listen to, although...

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.340
Are they still around?

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.340
They're still around.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.620
I haven't listened to anything on the radio in so long.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.620
Anyway...

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:30.860
The radio station that I grew up with, which was KROQ in LA, they're now streaming on Radio.com,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.260
and that's pretty much all I listen to now.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.500
He'll listen to some songs that used to have a lot of play, and I'm like, who the hell

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.500
are you listening to?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.500
He's like, dad, oh, this is...

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.310
What is it?

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.310
Social...

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.310
Distortion?

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.310
Yes.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:54.140
And I'm like, oh, yeah, it is.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:02.580
He's way into Foo Fighters, he's way into Green Day, he's over the top into Red Hot Chili Peppers.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.620
Are those considered alternative?

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.620
I never paid attention.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.620
Alternative rock.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620
All right, whatever.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.180
I was done with Red Hot Chili Peppers about 10 years ago, and the fact that it's come

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.700
back as he's full on addicted to them, I know he's a crap out of me.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.900
Give it away, give it away, give it away.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.410
Now.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.410
Give it away now.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.330
All right, there was...

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.330
Oh, quickly, Weasel is heading to changing the subject, is that okay?

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.330
Just interrupt me.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.780
Yeah, you know, it's funny, because I didn't pick up on the change, and I'm like...

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.780
I interpret...

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.300
Speaking of LA, I'll do a segue.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.060
Speaking of LA, I'm heading to Anaheim next week.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:49.300
I interpreted your statement as Weezer, which by the way, the Africa song is fantastic.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.900
Oh, did you see...

00:09:51.900 --> 00:10:00.100
But everybody's seen, I mean, lots of play about Weezer covering Africa by Toto very,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.100
very well.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.260
Did I see the Toto hash pipe cover?

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.700
Did you know that Toto covered hash pipe?

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.260
No, but let me finish my freaking story.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.820
Did you see it gets better?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.860
Imagine what is better than Weezer covering Toto's Africa.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.860
What could be better?

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.690
Imagine when Weird Al joins them on stage to play an accordion solo during the song.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.690
I have not seen that.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.250
That is worth checking out.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.370
It's not just Weezer playing Africa.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.890
It's Weezer playing Africa with Weird Al, not coming out to be Weird Al, not coming

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:35.300
out to do a parody, just playing a rockin' accordion solo.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.580
Did he take over the keyboard solo part of that song?

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.460
It's a moment that I'm glad was captured on film.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.660
Usually I hate it when I go to a concert and there's like 50,000 people, I guess I

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.660
don't go to concerts that big.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.060
I go to concerts that are in very small places usually.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.300
But when everybody's holding their camera up the whole damn show, their phone up the

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.740
whole damn show, it's like, just watch, man.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.740
Use your eyes.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.740
All right.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:05.380
It's very easy to find on the internets.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.820
Brand has already bookmarked that.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.340
That's my homepage now.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:14.730
So anyway, I'll be at Star West coming up here.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.010
Kids and I are going down early, going to the Disneyland thing.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.010
I'm going to send them back.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.010
Hopefully they make it home.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.850
Then I'll do my tutorial.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:21.850
I come back.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.850
I'm back for a week.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.310
I go down to Portland for PNSQC.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.310
Really looking forward to that.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.990
I kind of need to finish my presentation for that.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.390
So go ahead and ask your question.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.390
Star West?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.390
Star West.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.390
Is this because you had that prior commit?

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.390
Yes.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.390
Okay.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.390
Yeah, I'm just doing a tutorial, nothing else.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.430
And then I'm flying back afterwards.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.630
And then PNSQC, I am working on my presentation.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.870
So for those of you that have seen my modern testing thing, which would be just those of

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:57.370
you at Test Bash, hello, everyone.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.650
Welcome to the cast.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.650
Yes.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.530
I kind of ish some of the same stuff, but so much has changed.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.890
So at Test Bash, if you remember, the one listener, one of the three that was there, if you remember.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.130
You're talking about Brighton or Philly?

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.130
Brighton.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.130
Brighton.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.130
Philly was like a year before.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.130
Everything was a twinkle in our eyes.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.930
And I was working on Microsoft Teams.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.960
Oh my God.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.520
Is there a story that you can tell me off the air?

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:34.690
I don't think it's inappropriate to say on air.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:41.070
So I'll just do it this way.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:56.300
Teams, lowercase teams, some are being forced to be on capital T teams instead of Skype.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:10.700
Honestly, I don't really care except for, you know, forcing people to do exactly the

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:16.220
same sort of crap they've been doing on a totally new interface.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.420
But it's the best.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.560
Defined by who?

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560
I can give you a name.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.340
I know the name that you would probably name.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.570
And I just, so yesterday I loaded up Skype.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.290
I needed to talk to one of my PM's.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:42.050
Skype had the little green indicating, as you know, hey, my PM is there and he's available.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.230
So I started typing, wrote a long ass thing because I knew he was in his office, not in

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.920
the meeting.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:58.060
And I think it's absolutely rude when people go, are you there?

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.060
And then you respond yes.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:10.750
And then you write a 15 minute diatribe and their attention is captured the entire time.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.470
So here's a little tidbit I do on these things.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:18.870
If I'm going to ping you with some long ass question, I'm going to type it up in notepad

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.190
first.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.470
Then I'm going to say, hey, Alan, are you there?

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.990
And when you respond, I'm just going to copy and paste because I don't want to waste your

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.150
time.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.280
Okay.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.840
So I pinged, I wrote this long question, sent it.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.560
Then I got a response.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:44.150
Oh, this guy is exclusively on teams and cannot see your message.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.430
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:55.870
Could you not have told me that before I spent five minutes typing this goddamn essay?

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.230
Can you just copy and paste it from notepad again to someplace else?

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:04.030
Turns out actually in the middle of me typing, it turns out this same guy was actually walking

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.110
to my office.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.610
So literally like two minutes after I hit send, he was at my door.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.960
And I'm like, not even two minutes, like the 10 seconds.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.000
But I'm just like, this is dumb.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.330
Why don't they?

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.930
What I love Alan is our Slack usage.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.170
Slack is like teams.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.570
It's another product that lets you collaborate and communicate across your team.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.250
It's just so natural.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.570
It's just such a natural part of our communication.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:39.130
But I think Microsoft grew up embedded in email so much, it's hard for people to get

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.890
out of there and find another place to do it.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.090
And what's weird about Skype is I have to do a Skype call later, which sucks

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.890
because I had to install Skype.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.560
Sorry.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.630
There is a web interface.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.270
There was something, oh, I was telling a story about test, my presentation coming up.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:03.110
There was a story, if you remember, back on our regular schedule program, I'm modern

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.910
testing talk.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:12.110
If you remember at Brighton, I talked about modern testing, kind of how we got there,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:17.110
how my journey through software made these things make sense.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.270
I thought your deck was like Adventures of a Modern ...

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:26.310
And then we had just sort of finalized the principles.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.510
I knew they'd be tweaked a little bit, and I think they maybe haven't been tweaked

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.510
since then.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.750
They've actually lasted like seven months.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.990
But I didn't go into them in depth at all.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.630
I just showed them one by one, kind of walked through them and said, stay tuned,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.270
listen to the podcast, learn more about them a lot.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:47.950
I think what I want to do in Portland, what I'm planning to do in Portland, is actually

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.870
have a slide each on the principles and kind of talk about what they mean.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:57.710
So it'll be the one minute version of the last eight episodes at that part.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.670
So I'll take 10 minutes and talk through each of the principles and why I think they're

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.670
important.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:09.050
And then it leads up to the potentially controversial number seven, which is interesting.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.050
I'll bring it up there.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:15.370
I love bringing it up in test crowds because it's like, but what's cool about number seven,

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:20.250
and I don't have it in front of me, but number seven is the one where the tail end says,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:25.130
it may reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:31.600
And if a team is just starting on the modern testing journey, or they're not even there

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:39.120
yet, they're making software in a very predictable, traditional model, that principle is like,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.880
these are, it's usually the reaction.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.960
If I can quote the air quotes around that.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:52.560
But once you start moving down the modern testing journey, you look at that and you go,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.280
oh yeah, I could see how that makes sense.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.120
That's been my experience in both my team and talking to people that have looked at

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.120
these things.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.960
I think it's only controversial until it's not.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.980
And the way it becomes not controversial is that you start to realize, you begin to

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.940
realize that, okay, I can see, yeah, I could see that.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:21.800
So you and I talked offline in terms of one, we'll probably weave this into podcast

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800
episodes.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:33.440
But one of the things that I think is needed is sort of some tactical scenario discussions

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.200
around problems and how the scenarios weave together.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:43.320
Because I think the other thing that we need to talk about on MT and come up with sort of

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:53.320
a cogent way of doing it is these principles do not operate alone.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:04.200
And it's very similar when I go and talk about Agile and I go and talk about Lean, or even

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.200
Kanban.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.440
And now the sort of operational principles.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.120
One of the common things about Agile, as you know, is it's principle oriented.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:19.160
If it were rule oriented, then you start, it's just a matter of time before you have

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:25.850
an inability to adapt, which is the point of Agile.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:32.080
And that's probably where, just thinking quickly, where a lot of the fragile approaches fail

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.280
is they become too prescriptive and rule-based.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.000
They turn Agile into something it's not.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.680
And another part of it is also simplification.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:50.300
People at the very beginning, they will look at, what's an example, Lean I think has seven

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.690
principles.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:20:00.130
And until you practice, it's hard to keep all of the principles sort of in your head

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.370
and see how they sort of interact with each other.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:10.050
The issue with the principles is that if you do one to the extreme and ignore the others,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.330
it can absolutely take you into the weeds.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.890
And it's another principle that balances that.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.530
It's a check and balance system.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:23.010
It wasn't intentional in the original, but as they evolved, and actually as we discussed

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.530
them, I'm sure I mentioned this a couple times during our previous discussions, but

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:32.850
I was pleasantly surprised on how well the principles did interact with each other and

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.250
support each other.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.810
People need to practice the principles.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:41.210
This is why I think the scenarios are critical, so that they see how you connect the dots between

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.210
them.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:47.090
And I do think that as you connect the dots between them, I don't think, this is not

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.210
a belief.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.250
I've lived this.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.290
It becomes fairly easy for people to see how it works.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:21:01.620
I think the issue is it's still kind of too new and they don't see how the dots

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.620
connect.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.500
We're not being prescriptive.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.880
Of course not.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.880
Yeah.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.960
So I think, yeah, we have definitely plenty of future podcast fodder there.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.250
Cool.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.170
I have a couple things I wanted to...

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.770
One, sometimes Brent and I have conversations over Slack.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.770
Not over Skype, that's nice.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.370
Over Slack.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.020
And it ends up being interesting enough.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.780
Well, one, I'm too lazy to type it.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.660
And then two, I think, we can just talk about that on the podcast, because that'd be a

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.500
fun one to share with the three.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.880
And remembering back to our roots, the original...

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.240
The reason we have a podcast, it's not because we like each other, because that's not it.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240
No.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.120
He used to have these test architect group meetings and Brent would crash.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.920
He wasn't like a good tester or anything, but he'd want to hang out with the smart people.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.280
Yeah, that's it.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.120
But we would have these discussions and then I think it was Michael Hunter who said,

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.720
you guys got to record this into a podcast, because we just...

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.620
We're happy giving each other crap, respectfully.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.100
I respectfully think you're full of crap, Brent.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:13.620
I don't know about respectfully, but yeah, everything else in that sentence was accurate.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.780
I'm mad at Twitter.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.900
Okay, tell me about it.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.660
I saw you change your name on Twitter.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.820
My protest name is Twitter hates me.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.010
Twitter doesn't like me?

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.010
What is it?

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.010
Would they go on?

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.010
It's something like that.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.010
All right.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.530
Really, are you really surprised?

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.530
No.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.950
Can I finish my story?

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:36.950
It's an interesting story.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.560
I don't know if it's a good story, but I'm going to tell it anyway.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560
Twitter-ter.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.280
Oh, because you can't have Twitter as part of your username.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.150
So I put a hyphen in it.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.800
Nice.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.990
Doesn't like me.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.990
Yes, yes.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:58.350
I tried and also, Twitter also has a crummy password policy where your passwords can't

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.790
have spaces, but I'll save that for another rant.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.350
Oh, nope, I didn't.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:07.950
Anyway, as I've mentioned, maybe on here before, but there is a...

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.870
My current Twitter handle is Alan Page.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:15.160
You're welcome to follow me or block me.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.000
Many times I've gone to the Angry Weasel Twitter handle.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.560
Twitter.com, like Angry Weasel, hoping that it would just show up as a 404 at some point,

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560
but no it doesn't.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.450
It's there from a person who tweeted once nine years ago.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.450
That's it.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.970
One tweet nine years ago.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:41.870
So I read some stuff on the internet about how to...

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:42.870
What do you do?

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.390
How can you reclaim used accounts?

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:48.910
Some people have had some success just reporting it as an impersonation and explaining it

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.430
as not an impersonation.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:58.890
I can prove this is associated with me and had success in getting unused Twitter handles

00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.890
from Twitter.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:00.890
So I did that.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.450
There's a crapload of Angry Weasel.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.140
There's only one spelled correctly.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.760
Loop back into the conversation here.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:19.000
So yes, I can change the spelling of Angry Weasel and get another handle, but I wanted

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.360
the regular spelling one.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.280
So anyway, Twitter told me to F off.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.380
We don't do that.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.860
And so that happened.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.300
So then I thought, I wonder if modern testing is available.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:39.780
And modern testing is also one tweet from 10 years ago and then, or maybe an account

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.780
but no tweets.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.780
I think that one was one tweet from nine years ago as well.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.260
And then I also checked for AB testing.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.420
No, AB testing podcast.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.730
One of those.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.370
And it was created and it's never tweeted.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:25:07.150
So modern testing joined 2013 and you look at their, no, this dude is all about us.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:12.450
No, I appreciate spelling.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.610
They have the modern testing account.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.060
There's no I in testing.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.060
That sounds like a, oh, that sounds like a quote for a t-shirt.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.220
There's no I in testing.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.220
Oh wait, there is.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.220
Seven.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.460
But not this one.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:32.100
So anyway, that's my Twitter rant that, and Brandt doesn't care about reading, so he doesn't

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.780
notice that this letter is missing.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.780
So my wish for our, none of the three who work at Twitter is that we could reclaim accounts

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.740
that haven't been used in a decade.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.250
Yeah.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.520
What did you means to similar, right?

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.720
You have to, you have to pay for your domain, right?

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.070
You have to pay to renew it.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.350
Oh, right.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.580
And since there's no, yeah, they cost money.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:02.040
I wonder how long it'll take before Twitter has to do something on that front.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.560
So it's not, they don't have to do anything, but at some point in time, you would imagine

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:18.330
that, that certain decoration for redundant handles, uh, becomes so fricking obtuse, it's

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.810
becomes harder to use.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.810
Yup.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:22.890
Okay.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:27.330
Let's do, let's go, we'll go up that way.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:32.290
So I have, uh, in my hand for those of you not on the video feed, Oh, you know what I

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:40.610
want to do by the way, in this all tangent episode, uh, we should just for fun do an

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.610
episode.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.690
Why is your leg twitching like that, man?

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.690
You're freaking me out.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:49.650
Listen, ADD guy, move forward.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.170
I'm trying, but man, like the roof's shaking.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.650
What was I gonna say?

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:54.650
We should periscope it.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:55.730
We should periscope one of these.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:00.660
So like most of this stuff will get edited out that you don't even hear it, but we should

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:06.120
just live feed a podcast recording for the three.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.740
Sure.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.700
Not a tangent episode.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:15.100
Oh, and, and, uh, I just wanted to point out, this is the first podcast recording I remember

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.250
in a while where branch has not been wearing his AB testing shirt.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.050
I thought about putting it on today.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:26.810
So you can go to cafepress.com, whack AB testing and pick up your own AB testing shirt.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.770
But in the meantime, I have some questions for you that were thrown to me and I think

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.090
I have answers for them, but I'm going to check them.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.090
These aren't mailbag.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.090
I'm actually supposed to answer these at some point, but I'm just going to work through

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.330
you and see what you think of my answers.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.590
Okay.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.420
By me listening to your answers.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.060
This is a good one.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.820
I actually think that that model is one thing that makes our partnership work well.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:59.950
You're very good at writing concise language and I am not.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.990
I'm going to edit that as just says you are very good and I am not.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.690
A couple of questions about AI, ML.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.610
That's artificial intelligence and machine learning.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.290
For those of you not into the, the name game.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.250
Do you think AI and ML will replace the, replace the traditional tester?

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.960
As is a loaded question.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.760
Cause I don't even know what the traditional tester is.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760
I do.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.680
But does the question asker mean traditional?

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:35.420
I do think, I do think automation will replace the traditional tester and automation techniques

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.300
will include AI, ML.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.300
Yep.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.300
Yep.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.300
Pretty straightforward.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.880
There's a couple of companies right now using, it's interesting.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:51.820
There are companies like Testem and Mabel who use ML to improve automation and

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:58.500
actually make, I've always hated record playback, but they make some test generation tools that

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:04.460
look so deep at all the different ways that items can be selected that even if the, on

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.420
a webpage, that even if the item name or class or location changes, it can still figure

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.740
out what to do.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.980
Which again, which is solving a problem that could be solved just by having an approach

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.050
that makes like adding data IDs to those things.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.770
So just think of how the, how the market's moving.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.690
I don't know how much you're paying attention to it, but I actually had a one-on-one with

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.970
one of my employees just this week.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:38.490
And I actually think we're going to start to see the fall of the data scientist over

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.350
this next decade.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:50.030
And primarily, so I was talking to an employee and this employee, there was a bit of AI I

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.760
wrote.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760
He picked it up.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.000
Generalized it.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.760
He doesn't under, he doesn't understand data science really, but he does understand how

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:08.760
to take an algorithm and turn it into code and pass it inputs and evaluate outputs.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:17.190
And what I think is going to happen is number one, with computing the cloud, it kind of

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:27.280
raises, it kind of changes the definition of brute force in parallel.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.480
So there are a lot of techniques that can be done brute force.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:37.280
So when you have the cloud, you can do them really fast.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:43.960
So old algorithms will come into play that just couldn't scale because you didn't have

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:49.480
enough hardware resources in your lab or didn't have beefy enough machines.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.080
That kind of all just goes away.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.520
It can scale as much as you're willing to pay for.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:04.870
We're going to have AI techniques in APIs readily accessible to developers.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.630
So you drifted off my original question a little bit talking about data science in

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:09.630
general.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:20.960
No, but this, as these come up and as people solidify specific contexts, there is an old

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.960
tool.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.760
So AI has been in the industry, in the test industry for a long time.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:35.270
We've, there's a tool that I know Alan's familiar with that was, it's probably been

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.710
dead for 10 years now.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.350
And Genesis, right.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:47.750
And it used genetic AI to hunt through and find test cases.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.670
And it was very effective at finding bugs.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.430
What it sucked at is finding bugs that were important.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.430
Yeah.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.470
So what I've discovered so far, I spent a chunk of time.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:01.270
In fact, I just wrote my, some of the three notes I've shared from a few of these on

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.990
the Slack channel, but I do a weekly newsletter for my team.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.910
And I wrote up one this week on ML and AI.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.070
And I just got a lot of screws on my mind because I was looking at these questions.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:18.510
And what I'm realizing is while there's a, he, there's definitely a buzzword status push

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:25.420
for AI and ML in testing conferences are filled with talks about AI and ML tools, getting

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.260
massive funding.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:32.700
They use AI and ML, but they're not doing things particularly interesting.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.740
Like I mentioned the tools that I think it's really great.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:42.140
If you don't have access or the ability, like when we talk about software development, it's

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.940
not an us and them, it's just a we.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.940
That's the way I put it.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.580
And these tools are designed for, I need to write a bunch of web, a UI automation for

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.740
a web page.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.340
And I can't get the developers to change their code and add accessible IDs and they're not

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.340
writing automation.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.020
We've got to get something put together here.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.340
Those tools are excellent in that situation.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.970
I just don't want to be in the situation where they excel.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:08.050
Or I'm that last line of defense tester trying to write automation at the very end.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:12.330
These tool, these, these AI solutions, if you're in that situation, if you have to write

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:19.480
a bunch of a web automation and you can't work with the dev team or, or you're unable

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.200
to or they're unwilling to work with you and you just have to get this done, these

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.800
tools will accelerate your ability to do that, but they're not solving the root problem.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.440
That's what bugs me about them.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.120
Not yet.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.880
I think, but also in looking through what's out there in ML and AI, and there are some

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:44.400
tools that do some test generation based on examining the page, based on, based on learning

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.040
about the product.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.040
But I still feel like everything that I've seen out there is scratching the surface of

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.920
what's possible for improving quality using AI and ML.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.440
For example, oh, I just looked at this thing called sourced.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.040
It's sourced with a D in curly brackets.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:08.360
It's a static analysis tool, but like the things you've internally at Microsoft uses

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.360
an abstract syntax tree to break things down and figure out how things work together.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:19.560
But it has models and does a bunch of ML analysis to try and figure out where bugs

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.760
may be in the code based on a bunch of heuristics, which is, which is again, a start.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.600
If we could look at, if we could have ML and you might have this at your fancy data

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.040
science stuff that looks at customer usage patterns collected and then uses those to

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:40.560
figure out where risk areas and or what problems they need to be looked at by the

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.960
internal team using ML to help figure out pinpoint where things should be done.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.360
Better test selection, which we've both done, are all great things.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.680
I guess the point is, without me listing examples, there is a big push for AI and

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.680
ML and testing.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:02.160
There's a lot of it out there, but I feel like it's just barely getting started of the capabilities

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.010
of what we could use those things for.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:12.770
In that, I would say, and therein lies an opportunity.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:22.620
The Alan, I'm sure you're tired of this question, but where do ideas come from?

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.540
Ideas come from other ideas, Brent.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:31.120
So we've talked at the story like where air conditioning came from, right?

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120
Yeah.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120
Did that turn on?

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.040
Did air conditioning get it?

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.400
Did it land on, ooh, what we need to build is air conditioning overnight?

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.960
No, of course not.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.350
I will tell you that I know.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:50.710
So for example, we have AI here at Microsoft.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.470
So to the prior question, this customer usage data?

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.470
Yes.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.470
Do I have it?

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:02.480
I have lots of it, tons of it.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:10.600
What we still have work to do is connecting different data streams together and then coming

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.160
up along with an approach to context.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:22.680
So we here in Azure, we have the ability to, when we see, so we can use AI to sort

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:29.890
of cluster common failures together.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:37.820
We've had a similar thing in Windows for a long time where we get like call stack telemetry.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:43.860
This is actually, no, we're clustering similar signals based off of multiple different failure

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.420
classes.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:57.940
For example, hey, the network blipped, meaning it had a momentary loss of packets.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:06.260
We now have the ability to sort of group a bunch of different signals together, then

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:11.940
do what's known as discrimination analysis and go, okay, which set of signals really

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.000
is important for this cluster?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.720
And then go and pinpoint a root cause.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.480
Now what we're doing right there is essentially, if you think about it, what we're doing

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:30.650
there is using AI to find system integration bugs.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:42.080
Now because there's a lack of testers inside Microsoft, Dev's really interested in these

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.400
type of things because it helps them to scale.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.280
No one inside Microsoft, to my knowledge, and I think it's also because there's a lack

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.680
of testers in here, is trying to really apply this towards a test context.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.680
Although I'm on the compute team, like the one thing I would be interested in doing

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:08.000
and I haven't done is go and talk to some of the UI folks and see, you know, what,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.920
if anything, they're doing in this.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:16.100
Because a lot of the times on the compute team, you can view it as sort of a system

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.940
integration bug almost all the time.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.580
On the UI side, do you have another question?

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.740
Yeah, we've actually, interestingly, we've actually already answered the questions

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.810
that are coming up here.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:34.530
So we've actually talked through the other questions in talking about this, but one,

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.410
just to get your thoughts, I had a little bit of rambling, but what are some other

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:42.770
ways you see AI and ML supporting testers?

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:46.130
And this is weird for me because when I see a tester, I think, I don't want to do that.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.390
Supporting quality.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:54.070
You want to frame it as pre-production quality?

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.390
I mean, there's a whole bunch of existing techniques.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:01.090
It's essentially where do we move the needle?

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:13.300
Where I found AI is really effective is in scaling calendar time.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:18.650
And so if I had known we were going to talk about this, I would have done a

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.410
particular research, but there's something that I'll share with others.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:30.170
I did this a couple of months ago, and this is probably a deflection of your question.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:36.170
I don't focus, as I think I just, I am not focused day to day on how to use AI,

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:39.890
ML to solve the test problem.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:46.330
I'm focused on customer quality, which hopefully if you're a long enough time

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:52.370
listener to this podcast, you realize we view as a separate topic.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:40:03.060
But if you go to scholar.google.com and you do a search for test testers,

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:10.170
software testing, as well as AI and machine learning, you'll see that there are

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:15.650
a bunch of published articles already and that they're beginning to increase.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:21.450
So what's happening right now is academia is definitely doing research in a bunch of

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:29.350
different places, and it's not going to be, it's still going to be a few years

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:35.910
before any of these things hit something that becomes really useful for the masses

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.150
or really productized.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:44.100
But to me, this is absolutely on its way.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:52.330
Test prioritization, that might be one place where it would be an obvious

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:59.680
relationship between testing and the user data.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.080
So if you have test cases measured under code coverage, if you had,

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.080
if you did an experiment where some customers, you know,

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.680
interacted with an instrumented build, then you can start bridging the gap

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:21.610
between what are common sequences that customers go through and associate that to the test cases

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.440
that can validate that.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.000
Going to a world of how we do continuous deployment, right?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.100
Sure.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.000
You could run all of your test cases in five minutes by leveraging a million dollars

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.400
worth of cloud compute resources, right?

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.760
Probably is not effective.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:47.760
But you could also mitigate your risk by using historical data on both sides,

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:54.160
your test cases and your customer data to sort of prioritize what these cases are important.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:01.760
And then, like a very simple AI technique would be to use AI to decide the stopping condition.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.960
When is the risk minimized enough that you can just ship it now?

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960
Yeah.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.690
Okay, cool.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.590
All right.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.990
A little more long-winded than I wanted, but I'll take it.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.790
Oh, sorry.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.790
Hey, we are...

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.890
One thing, this is definitely last but definitely not least,

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:21.990
one thing we haven't brought up here is, but worth bringing up now is,

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:27.790
we lost one of our heroes last month when Jerry Weinberg passed away.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:32.290
I was looking through his list of books here and I realized,

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:36.470
I didn't realize that I had all of them.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:39.170
I recommend Secrets of Consulting a lot.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:45.370
It's a book about leadership, which is a good book about leadership.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.970
I recommended a lot to people.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:49.270
I forget who.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:52.170
Someone on Twitter asked me the infamous,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.830
how do you measure quality question?

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:59.080
And we started off with a little bit of,

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.780
well, what is quality and da-da-da-da-da.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:09.280
And I recommended that he take a look at the quality software management series by Weinberg.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.380
I think I might have recommended it started with book two, but maybe book one.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:20.280
Anyway, because the book is 20 years old, maybe 25 years old,

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.780
I can't remember, he asked if it was still relevant.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.980
I said, yeah, I think it is.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.280
And I hadn't looked at it in a while.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.480
I have it on my shelf at home.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.380
And he got back with it a couple days.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.980
He had already ordered it and got it.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.580
He goes, oh my God, this is so good.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.780
This is so relevant.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.740
It's helping so much.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.340
Yeah, it's really timeless work.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.540
I reread Are Your Lights On probably every other year or so.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.440
Just a good book to remind me how to frame problems

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.240
and to think about solving the real problem,

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.840
not the problem that appears on the surface,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.740
but taking a step back and solving the real problem.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.340
Well, I'll miss Jerry, but his written works live on, which is great.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.240
He just gave a lot to the software community.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.040
I wish I had never met him personally, have you?

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.280
No, I never did either.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:16.720
But based on his writings, I don't know if I'm going out on the limb,

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:28.100
but I wonder if really Jerry was continuously the ultimate modern tester.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.300
Could be, could be.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.400
His approach on things, it was timeless

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:41.360
because he had done it with a set of principles that don't die.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.210
And the guy could tell a story too.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:53.860
Yeah, you know, RIP Jerry, you've had a lot of impact to us for certain.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.620
And I'm sure he's well aware of.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.560
He's changed probably millions of lives.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.810
Yep.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.010
Okay, man.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.810
So I'll miss you Jerry.

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.910
Well, if we had our drinks here, we'd raise a drink to you,

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.710
but I'll do that tonight when I get home.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.210
And in the meantime, we have finished another episode of A.B. testing.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:18.540
So thanks for listening and we will talk to you next time.
