WEBVTT

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.580
Hello again, howdy, hey, I'm Alan I'm brit and we're back with another episode of a B testing

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.670
Does it have a number are we up to?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.830
87 we are

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.490
87 welcome to the 87th episode of a B testing if this is your first time listening to a B testing

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.650
Welcome, please go back to episode 80. You may want to back up

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.390
We've been diving into the modern testing principles on you can read those on modern testing org

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.550
We've been spending this is our sixth episode going through the seven principles will hit the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.270
the last one in two weeks, but this podcast in general is your

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.010
guide your gateway your information Center for a lot of things about software testing a lot of software engineering

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.870
Quality and of course the aforementioned modern testing. Yes

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.950
It's all that so that's the plan for today if you'll hit the fast-forward button now you can avoid our chit chat or

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.390
Since we don't work together anymore. This is our chance to catch up, too

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.270
So what's new with you? Mr. Jensen? Oh

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830
The biggest thing that's new is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.510
Baseball seasons over

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.900
Not for the professionals for your children. I assume yeah from my son although that reminds me

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.070
I need to sign them up for a fall ball. I keep forgetting that you want to stop and write yourself a note. Yeah, he actually

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.230
Totally going to do that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.290
Like yeah, cuz if I miss the date

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.100
let's see

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.280
Okay, then yeah, talk some amongst yourselves the Bellevue which is also called the Seattle

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.220
Unity office because outside of the Seattle area. No one knows where Bellevue is. We are

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.080
moving offices we are vastly outgrown both the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.480
Physical space and power and AC limits of our current space so

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.040
Another month or two and we'll finally be in our new spot pretty excited about that. It'll be pretty and nice. Where you going?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.440
Six blocks away. We're going to Lincoln Square South. Oh, okay again for the locals everybody else like shut up and talk about modern testing

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.660
Lincoln's is that the same building you used to be? No, no South it's

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.060
Three blocks south on the it's the newer one that went up on the corner of fourth and Bellevue way again more local trivia

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.820
Okay, we'll move on here has a lot of restaurants

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.460
Had they put anything into that Toys R Us yet? No the toys our s space is still available

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.300
Okay, so anyway, so anyway, I thought I'd just cuz I was thinking about it on the way to work

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.620
I have a bit of a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620
Where is the weasel update? Oh?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.380
I'm I mean I'm at the I was I was waiting for the song but oh we'll come back to that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.860
We'll go back to that, but you weren't done. I forgot that you just took a pause to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.500
Write notes on your phone so that I can read that we now return to a quick update from

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.340
Brent Jensen yes, so the the next biggest thing that's happening is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.180
So my oldest has been home for the summer

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.300
He's got an apartment where he's he's gonna move into his apartment on Saturday in Pullman in Pullman

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.210
He's already pre-warned

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.170
Things like he may not be home next summer. He may not come home for Thanksgiving

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.730
So I actually think even though he's not willing to say this and he may not know but just because you know

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.250
I've gone through the college experience. I actually think this is

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.530
It I think this is him actually moving out

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.200
That's congratulations on a successful early launch

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880
Yeah

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.160
It I I hope I hope I and all of our listeners with children have the same experience with all of our kids

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.680
Yeah, no, I don't think I'm gonna have this same. No I can't wait. I can't wait to get rid of them

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.920
Move out they're obviously not avid listeners to the podcast

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.000
No, but they have heard me tell them that as soon as as soon as the younger one goes to college that

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.680
The house is being sold immediately and we're not leaving a forwarding address just a PO box

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.100
That's you know that's not a bad strategy

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.350
But you can mitigate it. Just you know if you if you'd like where you live you know just change the locks

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.590
Thought about that thought about that, but I think it's better just to actually I don't like

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.990
The house is fun. I like the house. It's a nice house is beautiful

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.270
I am I have not adapted well to suburbia

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.000
We became suburban to get the kids in better schools and all that but I I would like

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.240
Living this cookie-cutter house. It's nice

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.360
And it's big in the three-car garage and lots of room and have a huge home office

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.720
And it's awesome a great place for a dog and everything that's cool, but I

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.720
I

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.320
Suburbia takes attacks on me

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.040
I need I need a neighborhood or a building with character that sometimes only a more urban

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560
Environment can provide yeah

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.630
You and I are so far apart there. I can't even see you from where I'm saying

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.390
I want a house with so many acres. I don't even don't even know which direction my neighbors are

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.870
Yeah, that actually would be pretty sweet

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.670
Yeah

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.170
Yeah, not cool for me not cool for me

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.330
I want to go outside and run naked in my prairie. Oh god you that God confidence

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.750
Could you move to Russia and do that?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.640
No, okay. I don't want that happening within a thousand miles of me

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.500
Too late

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:21.460
All right, so yeah, so that's that's a that's a big deal and then the next thing that I'm

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.460
So school should start back up for me on August 20 you get a finally finish

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.050
You didn't go for it get the home stretch done

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.320
You know

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.970
I'll just I'll just submit to everyone on there. I just don't

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.820
Want to do it?

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.820
I want to be done with this thing and I don't want to do one final burst of pain

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.400
but yeah, so I'm kind of

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.660
Constantly flipping that coin in the air and picking it up and re-flipping and picking it up and re-flipping

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.940
Yeah, it's it is the last time but the idea of

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.470
Going through another four months of all of my nights and weekends

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.660
gone

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.740
No pain no gain. Yeah, but I am thinking first you've already got most of the game. I am yeah, I've gotten all of the game

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.100
That's the other thing too is I'm so wired for for return on investment

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.580
right yeah, I am too old I am too old and

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:45.330
Not from the the weariness part, but I'm at a stage in my career no one will actually care

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.500
About this degree the only reason to do it is to be done

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.620
It's not gonna get me a job in the future

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.110
Right. Gotcha. It's not it's it's I've gotten what I wanted out of it. Yeah

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.670
Anyway, there you go. So

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.830
School may start for me in August. It may also start for me in January

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.460
All right. We'll see how I will finish

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.080
I have six years from the start to finish

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.000
And I still think I have five or six semester starts left

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:33.450
Alright, excellent. That's now I'm done. Okay a quick update of my fall travel schedule because it just got a little ridiculous

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.050
In fact, I just in fact, I haven't sent the mail. I just made the choice last night

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.450
To turn down I almost went to a conference in November because in Korea and I really wanted to go there

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.790
But there's too much else going on. I'm heading off to Iceland next week

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:57.350
Shouldn't that next week? No, not the week after and then in October. I thought I was going someplace in September end of September

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.290
Very beginning of October over that weekend heading down to Anaheim to give a workshop at Star West

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.850
popping back up north be home for about four days heading down to Portland for a couple days to

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.290
Give a talk on modern testing and also a workshop at

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.850
PNS QC which is one of my favorite conferences

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.170
I think the size and caliber of presentations is usually pretty good. So I'm excited about that in

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:27.030
Later in October. No. Yeah later in October. I'm home for like two weeks and then I'm going to

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.770
Copenhagen and Helsinki on a work trip

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:38.700
Home for about three more weeks and heading to Sweden for a week for a work trip and that should close out the weasel

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.860
2018 travel schedule I would have had to shove that two more weeks later hit that Korea trip

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.700
But I was like that's I think it's enough. So doing that

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:56.300
So shall we you have a sub in Korea or is that a no? No, the Korea trip was a conference

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.620
request speaking speaking request

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.550
And I thought about doing it because I actually I am trying to

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.840
not

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.360
speak at any test conferences in

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.080
2019 I may speak at

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.080
Given the right opportunity. I'm trying to get out of

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.130
If I've talked to you about this before I want to get out of the test. I

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:29.050
Want to get out of the test conference speaking except for rare occasions. I will always speak at ministry test because it's like

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:36.210
The test batches because they're really good and the audience actually gets it. It's it's a proper audience. But I

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.410
I think I want to

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.450
If I do more speaking I will do it more at

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.160
Development center conferences. I think that's where my mind and content is is what improving

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.480
software quality through better engineering and development practices

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.520
so I think I may start focusing more there when I speak and just speaking a lot less in general because

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.560
It's fun and it's great and people clap at you and they ask you questions. You feel all validated and stuff, but

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.750
I think I want to focus my efforts elsewhere. I think I think that makes sense

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.990
based on my

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.970
My knowledge of you and your passions. I think you're done

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.520
Sort of teaching testers how to test

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.860
Yeah, right exactly. It's kind of not where we're going with modern testing

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.640
I think it makes sense to start you going through and say okay

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.880
No, we need to start teaching devs how to test

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.720
Although I don't I think that may be premature quite honestly like I would suggest to you

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.190
that

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.590
No, there's still value in you going to the test conferences and teaching testers how to lead

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:56.270
I think yes, but I'm gonna do that selectively test leadership conference in the one I did in New York

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.630
That has some validity to it test bash as I mentioned before

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.990
like an agile testing conference I could do but

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.470
Again, I'm gonna be much more selective. I'm I'm

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.120
I am done talking to

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.120
Junior testers about how to get started in testing and test careers and all that stuff

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.480
I want to help I and I think a

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640
Lot of what we need to do with testing is about

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.640
Being a modern tester and someone just asked me on Twitter Jim Holmes. Hey Jim about

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.160
Give a description of what it's like to be a modern tester. I like given the tautology answer of

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.120
Well, actually it says no such thing as a modern tester

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.560
But we do recognize I spoke for you. So we do recognize that

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:46.870
Someone who leads the team towards following modern testing principles. I'm okay with calling them a modern tester

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.800
Yeah, it's a leadership position and it's a position that I am happily grooming

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.640
Most are all people in my team towards I mean they're they are

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.000
Whether they know about modern testing principles or not. They're all kind of in a modern testing role right now

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:11.480
In terms of like the the tipping point I I I don't think we're done here on this topic

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.070
until

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.640
We get a sufficient amount of the test community

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.930
to understand that

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:28.480
The content after the semi-colon in principle 7 is not only a good thing

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.100
But something they should be working towards. Yeah, I want to walk

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.580
Yeah, there is a lot of fear and people see it as it's like the controversial part and we'll talk will

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.300
We're all the good time talking about that in our next recording. Yep

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:50.380
But yeah, yeah, I think so. All right, so we do this week. Yes, we shall we shall and let me start let me start by

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.540
Saying that I slapped I don't know if I CC'd you on this or not

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.860
Maybe I mentioned it in slack

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.060
But I did slap a creative commons attribution share like license on the modern testing principles

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.900
To encourage people like it's totally yeah do whatever you want with them. It's so people have asked like can we copy these?

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.060
Can we translate these? Yes attribute the source and do whatever you want change them for your team

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.180
If you want attribute the source, it's totally fun

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.880
Took out the middle man. No longer need to ask just the licenses there follow along

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:25.540
I would be careful about changing for the team though, right? Some people could change it and turn it into something and that supports

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.140
Traditional then it will yeah, it wouldn't really be modern testing anymore

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.860
It says that would attribute the original they would go. Oh, okay, you've you've changed this

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.620
There's a license give us the right to tell somebody to take it down if we discovered

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:46.860
No, I don't want that. I want people if somebody wants to bastardize. I don't think they're going to I am a truster

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.900
All right. I'm a truster and an enabler

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:57.540
Maybe that last doesn't sound right. Okay, let me read to you modern testing principle number six. Oh my god

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.020
It's been so long since the podcast started. It's about freaking time. Okay

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:09.450
Number six we use data. Um, he thought I was gonna start didn't you you can read these at modern testing org

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:17.130
number six we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.590
product hypothesis and business

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.450
What does that mean? Well, we'll dive into a deeper

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.370
Give it to me

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.370
How would you

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:38.410
Paraphrase that back to me. What does that mean? We do or and we meaning teams following modern testing principles or teams

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.250
delivering software in this way

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.970
Why is

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.670
Actually, let's talk about why why is this important?

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.700
Before I go on to that, that's a great question and we will get to it

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.950
I want to read you a tweet

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.630
that that I

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.140
Don't know how I got it

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.470
Follower of a follower of something and I'm gonna tell you

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:11.440
This is relevant. Okay. Okay. I am listening to your tweet reading

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.240
exploratory testing is

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.440
the key to high quality software

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.300
semicolon a highly intellectual and

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.060
time-consuming activity

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.170
Often pushed off to end users. How do you feel about this tweet it?

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:44.190
And again, it's relevant. It is relevant and I had a similar tweet

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:52.200
Exchange that just to continue on this morning about the same topic it reeks of ignorance

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:59.370
To me. I am NOT first. I am NOT against exploratory testing total value in that

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:05.250
Using data to understand customer usage and to close the gaps and monitoring etc

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:10.770
Has nothing to do with shoving buggy software on to customers because you don't give a shit about them

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:16.960
And there is a and I'm gonna get on my soap boxes. I'm pissed off about this because there are people in the industry

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:23.560
Some with loud voices who tweet about the new tweet saying that or speak saying that

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.800
Having customers, you know letting customers find bugs even if they're not actually finding them directly

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.480
It's monitoring that's revealing these things is a horrible thing and it's lazy

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:39.320
I had I saw one author. I can't call him an author one article writer

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.960
Because in the internet, I guess everyone's an author

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.080
I had an article where they mentioned testing and production as a last quote

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:54.520
Maybe I'm quote me. I'm not quoting but as a last gasp resort to find bugs using the customers as testers

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.310
so so anyway, that's why you triggered me because I see a

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:09.030
very big lack of understanding on how to use monitoring how to use data and how freaking valuable it is done, right and

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:15.370
They think it's just this lazy thing teams do because they don't want to do testing where that's not the case at all

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.190
Was that the answer you wanted or did I kind of go?

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.070
close

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.070
You know if if

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.430
If this

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:29.930
Tweeter

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:38.900
Had not used the words pushed off to end users. I would have had no problem. I

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:46.120
Actually, I totally agree with the first half of that. I mean again to be cool. Yeah, anyway

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:52.730
I'm gonna I'm gonna you talk I'm gonna breathe. Okay, it is not pushed off the end users

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.540
So the the principal talks about validating the hypothesis

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.410
Actually the way we word it is better than the way I'm remembering how we worded

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.340
We close the gaps between the product hypothesis and the business impact. What does that mean?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.800
means when we wrote code

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.240
We had a theory around what is valuable to be clear

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.480
We had a hypothesis

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:24.850
Right. Yeah, right. Well, I'll just say yes, right?

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.530
Well, no, I'm a data scientist in my world

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:33.330
Hypothesis is overloaded but I'll just say yes because it's not worth going into but

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.000
There are for the record I win. Yes

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.770
We have talked about this before in that is

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.660
the problem with ET

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.370
Now is it the key to high quality software?

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.140
Probably now, but they're saying exploratory testing

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.860
Okay, if this is something that's pushed off to an end user

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:06.820
Then I'm gonna say it's not exploratory testing anymore. It's actually this clever thing that we call

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.300
using the product

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.290
Now when a customer is using the product, is it highly intellectual? Maybe

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.680
Now I will say most products if it require highly intellectual

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:28.130
You probably have a usability problem like customers don't want to have to think too hard to get their solution solved

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.360
the time-consuming activity I also have a problem with a

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.460
traditionalist point of view is we try to

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:46.220
We try to prevent harm to the customer and we see it as as us

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:54.860
Again, it kind of is like the the champions the champions of quality slide that I keep referring to that Alan has produced

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.300
Right. We're a superhero team. Why are we letting that poor pregnant pregnant mom?

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:09.500
Take the bullet instead of us. We should be doing it. That's not actually the reality

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.960
today, I will let me share a

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:20.800
Story and then I'm gonna go into a lot more on the the what why and how after you do you share your story?

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800
We'll comment actually have another tweet thread

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:30.770
Highly related. I want to read to you. Okay, so we should do a whole episode of Alan and Brent read tweets

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.490
No, actually would be fun

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.570
I'm already vetoing the idea. Anyway, go on story time. All right

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.400
it was my last week and bing and

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:50.510
I'm sorry. I need to interrupt just for the the new listeners Bing is like Google. All right, go on

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.360
All right, but Bing Bing Google's things really well, it's fine. It works

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.200
moving on

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.720
It was my last my last week in Bing

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.840
my

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.560
Executive had set up in all hands on the Wednesday and we had

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.840
We had an individual from a partner team come in

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:26.480
And they did a presentation because we had worked we had done a co-development project with that team and it and

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.620
Finally shipped it well

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.100
It was best essentially shipping a Bing app in in the Windows Store

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.700
at the same time

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.080
Google

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.480
Was shipping an app into the Windows Store?

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.090
in and this person told a story about

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.970
about how

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.810
We finally got this thing across the wire

00:22:53.170 --> 00:23:00.930
and one of the things that they owned producing was a sort of a documentation on how to streamline and get things into

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.800
the ecosystem and

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.960
They decided to produce us a slide deck around what not to do now

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.620
they decided to use the Google app as an example because

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:25.420
a month prior when they were first onboarding the Google app, they went through and they just found bugs everywhere and

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.160
Much like I think this individual

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.250
Would have done is just mocked how crappy the software was

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.140
There were just bugs and bugs and bugs

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.440
everywhere in the Google app, okay, so

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.840
I

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.840
Again fast forward a month later

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.320
She's she's producing the streamline thing and she wants to get screenshots of what not to do

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.420
so she's like aha, I will load the Google app and

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:05.600
She loaded it. It of course had updated by that time and she failed to find

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.740
any of the bugs

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.510
that she had found earlier and

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.060
She she actually commented on

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.820
Yeah, it was amazing how how quick

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:29.070
they were I do not understand how they did that and I pulled her aside and I said

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.800
That is why Windows is having a problem

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:39.160
The traditional point of view when you're in a world where you have a lot of software in

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.940
your reaction time

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.830
Like when you and I grew up in this company in this company

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.000
Windows shipped every three years

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.040
Everything shipped every three years, right? You did not you had to get it right the first time

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.580
Did we ever?

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:07.890
No, do we have any idea of how much we got it right the first time that didn't matter

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.770
We have some like a

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:18.210
Episode or two ago. I talked about kin right that was last time. Yeah, that was a traditionalist

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.230
That started off in a traditionalist model

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.130
Right and it was an unsuccessful product

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.990
right

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.270
Would the company like to have had?

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.910
That time and that development money back you bet

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:46.050
We talked multiple occasions about lean startup and the metric that matters and the decision to pivot and persevere

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.270
This is what data brings to the party data

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.250
allows you to

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.810
Understand what parts of your product is being used

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.930
What parts of the product isn't being used?

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:16.090
And it allows you to scale the team by focusing your limited resources on

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.930
The parts of the product that matter. Yes

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.160
Yes. Yes

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.160
there is a

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.520
12 minute answer to your question. Why?

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.490
Data is critical to scale now

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:38.730
If you combine these with the other principles, right?

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:45.330
So this the the individual I was talking about before was amazed that she couldn't find any of the bugs in Google

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.370
Right. I'm not

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.410
Because I know Google instruments the crap out of everything

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.070
They worked through

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:02.370
When they saw errors coming in I know because I interviewed with Google years ago

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.140
Right. They have a two-week release cycle. They go to or at least back then. I don't know what they do today

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.740
Yeah, and again not Google in general says Google apps

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.900
Mobile apps in this case. No, but this was this was this was the Google philosophy all up

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.900
I don't know if it is still today

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.630
but back then

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.490
What they did is after the initial release they had

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:30.590
They would have an individual or team of individuals after the release

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.150
They didn't start working on the next features

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:40.430
They the after their release the deep dove into the telemetry and go what is the problem that we have now?

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.520
they're even smarter right because they

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.410
they follow the practice of

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:57.030
Continuous integration which means the number of bugs so you you you do end up shipping bugs

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.940
But when you do continuous integration you have as long as you have the right monitoring in place

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.500
As long as you have the right telemetry you end up turning around and fixing that bug the next day

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.500
I think that's the piece that's missing from the mindset of people who see it as pushing things off

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.660
Quick story on data then I want to read a tweet stream to you is

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:25.080
When I worked on the project that I refer to as a stupid science project to make Android app. Yeah, my windows phone

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.780
We had an offshore team of five maybe testers who?

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.940
We just gave them who would test apps just

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.220
Various Android apps they'd load on they'd side load onto windows phone

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.980
They'd run them reporting about they found so we could figure out what was up with our system

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:49.410
It got to a point to very very quickly where we said actually just stop entering bugs

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:55.580
Run the scripts overnight because we knew from the data every morning when we come into work exactly what bugs they hit

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.700
We knew where every single incompatibility was yep

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:04.380
It was faster for us to look at the data and figure out what the problem was and dive in and and fix the bug if we could

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:12.540
Then it was for them to enter the bug report. Oh, this is I know we have talked about this on multiple times on

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.000
Before we actually even started talking about modern testing, right?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.040
It is absolutely my belief that the best way for testers right now to write automation is

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:32.240
Write the automation as low generators. Yes, and you their validation from the product telemetry

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.520
Let the telemetry be the Oracle

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.200
Yes

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.960
And I've always said in fact this may even be in how it does offer at Microsoft the Oracle is the hardest part to write

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.620
The part that figures out whether the test pastor failed let the telemetry figure out what's going on

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:52.260
Yeah, it's much easier because what I often ended up doing was but I remember having a whiteboard conversation in

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:57.860
1997 to discuss whether I could use get pixel to test set pixel and

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.100
I thought and what I ended up

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.620
You know taught at least whiteboarding would never doing was we whiteboard it out basically an implement a new

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:10.780
implementation of get pixel to test set pixel and and luckily even in my

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.300
Niamhiti was smart enough to think that was stupid

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.730
And you know why?

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.770
Because it was stupid. Yes, because it

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.850
Exactly, let me read you this is actually it's interesting you brought up that tweet because

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.730
To read to me because I don't know if you saw this tweet for me last week

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.920
Or I said I did see something relevant

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.480
Just because a team relies on customer data to understand or evaluate customer value or quality

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.960
It doesn't mean that the team is relying on that customer to test the product

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:47.470
To the people who keep saying the quota part of that sentence, which is the last part stop saying that then someone said

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.750
Analytics are great, but they don't reduce the need to verify correct system under test behavior before shipping

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:56.910
Unless your software doesn't matter much to people like a free game on your phone

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:01.660
And I said actually in a lot of cases example web services

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:08.140
It's much more efficient if my monitors detect changes and reject new code appropriately than if I took the time to verify correct

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.540
Behavior before shipping. Yeah, and

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.140
The reply I got back was how is it more efficient to break customers?

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.780
All the information is available to you before shipping. You just have to look and be smart about looking

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.220
what services do you ship broken and

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.530
All kinds of the point I want to focus on there is no you

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:34.590
Have all the information available to you you you don't know how the customer is gonna use your product

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.870
You could never know that and to quote Eric Reese

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:42.430
Show me a product that ships zero bugs and I'll show you a product that shipped far too late

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.200
Brent we will not be able to show Eric Reese a product that shipped with zero bugs

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.560
number one period

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.800
right

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:03.720
I'm sorry even even you know the simplest stupid tic-tac-toe app. I can guarantee you it shipped with bugs

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.380
right the and the reason why and

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.080
I'm bet you the developer knew it

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:16.340
The reason why is because they made a decision these bugs don't matter oh

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.890
Oh my god, really shipping a bug

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.950
So the Google thing so here's the secret here's the secret

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:35.400
customers want their problems solved and they want the least amount of time spent on

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.670
friction due to bugs

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.630
Okay, so code paths that customers don't use

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:52.270
Guess what they don't care. It's not shipping a bug

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:59.670
It does not mean the customer is broken. I know I know I know this reminds me actually I gave them presentation on metrics

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:05.710
Well at least ten years ago if not longer and one of the joke slides. I made was a

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:11.350
This is back when product is I can tell how old it was because remember had a mock-up of a product box

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.910
when used to buy software in boxes yep, and

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:21.150
For the bullet points in like bullet points of features like you know twice as fast as our competition

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:27.650
Whatever I wrote like a bunch of stuff customers don't care about like over 20,000 test cases run

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.640
76% code coverage

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:37.960
No customers don't give a crap about that stop thinking that customers give a shit about your testing effort

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.200
They don't they don't care about your testing effort. They want their problem solved

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.680
Yes, God and just get out of the mindset. I don't know why people think that

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.030
Again, this was ten years ago back then when tests last

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:58.390
Software and functional test teams were much more common still they didn't customers

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.430
Don't care what the testing effort was as long as the software

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.350
Allows them to solve their problems without making them want to throw their computer against the wall

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.710
Yeah

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:14.750
Right the reason why in the old days we would do all of this testing upfront is

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:22.020
Because we didn't have the ability to react right today. We do right we had we would wait

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.320
I mean the ability to react was wait for the bug reports to come in from the enterprise customers

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.320
And then eventually build a service pack

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.290
Right or a hot fix. Oh, yeah, if important a hot fix

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:36.910
me um

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.830
and

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.310
Here what I'm essentially saying is

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.180
Treat every release as a hot fix

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.400
Yeah

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.840
the

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:55.440
Ship frequently ship small look at the data to to describe to you where to go next

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.720
Let's get back on track here. I see you referring to your notes. So we're of one mind

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:07.430
So the angry part is over for now. So the key it start no, no, no the key why is

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.840
The data tells you where to focus. Yes

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.220
Yeah, and as we've talked about many times before

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:25.360
Speed is what's important in today's world. Mm-hmm. If you want to compete you need speed now

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.720
caveat just like everything else

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.020
We're saying this is the general rule

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.100
There are exceptions

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.770
Right even even in your current product, whatever it may be

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.850
There's going to be a set of

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.930
Hey

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.930
even in a small

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:54.930
Flight environment like with continuous integration you're shipping the prod constantly. I still recommend flight rings

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:02.230
Where you're looking at monitors and then you you you then slowly widen the number of customers that can get it

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.390
Let's move on and talk about a little about a little looking at the clock

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:13.430
What is how does the modern tester lead a team to do this? Like like, how do you?

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:17.270
How do you make your team use data in a way that that?

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:24.180
Closes gaps. So we we did episode 82. Yes, and that was actually a good prequel

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.220
So at this point you could pause go from the 82 and go. Oh, that's a good idea

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.060
Huh, so the how is actually covered really well in 82 you're right. It is in terms of

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.740
evaluating

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.320
Your your your product hypotheses and the in

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.320
That's what's important like we would rather

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.320
Test focus on how to improve the business

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.160
How to improve let's say the value or the revenue of the business

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:58.460
Rather than what they're accustomed to which is how to reduce the cost. Okay, but that said

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.560
You know

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:09.060
I don't know that any test team would ever do this. I think it would be really freakin smart for test teams to do this

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:17.020
But then so once their product ships, so let's say they want to go through and do the prescriptive and preventative testing model

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.230
once

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.430
Now go back and look at the data and

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:29.760
Try to evaluate how much of your time was wasted. How much of your time? Did you spend testing enough?

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.750
Testing a feature that got three users

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:42.670
still, you know go look at the place that got a thousand users and see what problems they're having because

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:49.870
That's probably what's more important. But if you go back and you go what miss if you take the product telemetry and say hey

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.230
Where did the

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:57.510
So but let's pretend well, you actually you're a test director. Okay, so

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.180
Our quality director

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.780
So yeah, cuz I don't care about testing. I care about quality. Yes

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:09.500
so but you still and I don't know if it's changed but as of

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.040
What was it a year ago when I came and presented to your team?

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:19.900
Right you had testers sure. Okay from a management point of view

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.610
You're accountable

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.890
For where your team invests its time. Yes

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.420
I

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:37.120
Your philosophy is to sort of delegate those decisions, but ultimately you hold the accountability

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:42.320
Like because you made a decision to delegate those decisions. Sure. I'll not disagree

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.900
It'd be worthwhile to go. Okay, where did your investments pay off?

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.280
Right. It's a few had a month-long test pass that was scheduled

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.380
I

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.380
Just I just threw up all over the conference room

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:06.940
It's hyphen never never again in my life. Would I do something like that? How dare you even mention that? Yeah, you may continue

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.340
All right. It's worthwhile looking at the data and then

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:19.220
Okay, so maybe maybe you're gonna go done down this this this path, right? Maybe we've opened your eyes a little bit to

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.940
Hey, there is a better smarter way

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:26.400
Maybe you're in a position where you're like, hey, how do I convince my executives?

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:30.540
Right the data helps you make this transition as well

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:37.220
You go look, you know what? I don't think this is the right way. I don't think this is the efficient way

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:43.820
For us to deliver quality software. I think we need to get continuous integration going

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.780
I think we need to get I did the data

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.430
right

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.910
This month-long test pass cost our business

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.990
Depending on the size of business like it wouldn't be uncommon and

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:03.470
For a month-long test pass that costs well over a million dollars just in payroll let alone the hardware costs

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.900
right and

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.880
Look, we got three customer clicks on this feature

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.210
Right. I don't think we're using our resources efficiently

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:20.920
The other thing is

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.980
Customer it is

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.000
not

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.020
true that

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.500
Shipping bucks of customers is breaking the customer

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:38.740
It is also not true that it's a violation of some unwritten test law

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:46.140
Also true in in the modern testing thing we want devs to be held accountable for code correctness

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.100
We want QA to be held accountable for the quality culture

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.900
and the delivery of quality and

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:03.420
It is definitely not the case that if is I could see someone responding to this effect is like

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.420
Hey, if just one customer hits the bug

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.200
Then it's a big, you know catastrophic problem

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:21.330
Catastrophic problems are things like customer does something and it deletes their data store. Mm-hmm, right or it corrupts their OS or

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:24.210
It publishes their credit card

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.400
Numbers to the dark web. These are

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.040
catastrophes and you

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:37.120
It is absolutely true that you should still continue to prevent though that type of code from going up into the wild

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:44.840
But a lot of the times the the product hypothesis is wrong. We've we have talked on multiple occasions

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.440
that

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:55.590
Who values your product often isn't even like in a v1 situation. This is very often the case who values your product is

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.790
Often not the customer you're targeting

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:05.740
Yeah, and again for the third time probably on this podcast will refer you the chapter 8 of the lean startup

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:12.420
With the pivot or persevere chapter with all the different kinds of pivots you may make based on what you learn from your customer

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:16.420
About how they use the product you learn from the data

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:26.100
Who your customers really are and what's important to them? Sure completely agree now going into

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.620
Into data I'll add

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.460
You know one one caveat

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:40.420
Right once you go into the data, there's a whole rich rural infrastructure on on this right privacy

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:47.160
You can go too far. I think once you start getting into the data world. I think we need to start talking about ethics

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.520
Yeah, right

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.830
We want from a quality world we want to

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.420
benefit the business by making our customers happier

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.100
doing things with the data that they generate that

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:14.140
If they knew about it wouldn't make them happier is a likely ethical problem

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.020
Yeah

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.780
But there are other requirements and then we know you know we

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.300
GDPR

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:28.500
Government requirements. So going into the data space does come with its own

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.020
bureaucracy

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:38.300
But it is vastly better particularly when you combine it with the other principles we talked about the theory of constraints

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:45.100
continuous integration it ends up being a less risky in a much better way of

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.320
of

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.600
building product quality. Mm-hmm. Let me our

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.680
Conversation so far reflects a lot on web services

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.240
Now we can ship multiple times a day and get this data very quickly and hypothesis driven

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.720
I want to talk a little bit about how these things apply to

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.720
slower

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.920
Shipped products. I don't think there's much of anything that ships every three years anymore

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.440
No, but if you're a product that ships I mean there is

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.400
Download fatigue from customers even with apps that they're seeing

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:24.040
updates every day for your app, although it can happen in an area in if you're having some bad bugs coming in but

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.200
There's a level of fatigue or ship

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:37.650
There's a level of download fatigue users can go through. So aside from that let's say you're gonna ship your product every two months

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.180
Two weeks. It's okay every two weeks. Thank you

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:45.130
You may

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:50.850
Have a brand new feature you want to get out because customers really need this and it's really easy for people to

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:58.540
Sort of hand wave around solving a customer problem by just saying a customer asked for this. They gotta have it

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.060
I gotta get into I'm gonna ship it and I say great ship it to them

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.780
Do you have how do you know if they're going to like it? We're gonna call them and ask them

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:13.430
Yeah, I would say if you're shipping every two weeks or especially if you're shipping everything

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:14.390
three months

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:20.170
But if you're going to ship something new because you think it solves a customer problem

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.530
You better damn well have the data to help you figure that out

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:31.950
I think what you may not be able to so on the data front, right? Sure call the customer. That's the data point

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:38.870
Another common thing is is either a proactive or a reactive survey

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:45.550
Sure, just understand that both of these things are considered to be very low quality data

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:48.750
Yes, and the point I'm getting to is

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:56.110
Sure, all this stuff works in a lot of the examples you see from talks on the internet and articles are around shipping web services

00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:00.790
Or websites things that can ship and update where you can react very very quickly

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:06.790
But the point I want to make is even if you have something that can't react very very quickly

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:14.150
You still need to use your better serve to rely on that data to help you understand

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.790
much much more about

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:19.370
customer usage customer quality customer experience

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.990
Right and the other thing is I find

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:28.450
we started the podcast off with this sort of concept and I find that people take a

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:34.430
Take a strong stand on on a principle basis. So for example

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:39.900
You know shipping bugs to customers is you know, apparently

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.380
Just natively evil, right?

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:53.700
But even if you're in the situation where you where you only ship once every three months

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.040
That doesn't mean you have to accept

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:06.190
That that's the way it should be the next time we ship right? There are always ways to improve this

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.870
so for example, I I my phone is

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.100
an Android and

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:19.180
I've noticed that there are two different sort of update models. There is the

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:27.220
There there appears to be a model where an app will indicate it needs to be updated and

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:32.140
Android will will just silently handle that update for me

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:38.900
But there also appears to be a model where the app itself you launch the app and it says

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:47.280
Hey, I need to be updated and it didn't signal to the Google app management system

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.600
To do the update for me

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.530
right am

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:56.990
that in place app that in app update

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:03.230
That irritates me it should right the one where the app or the

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:09.470
Update happens, maybe you tell me after the update that hey I updated right

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:14.640
I got that one of these this morning said 14 apps were updated. So you're all cool. Yeah, then my

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:21.580
But then for me it seems like four out of five of the times I have to do the in app update

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:28.020
It's then a Wi-Fi required. Oh, I haven't and actually I've never seen that one. So

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.860
I would imagine it happens when the app needs an update, but the Google Store hasn't

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.100
propagated the update yet

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:43.990
Yeah, so in that particular case if I were an app developer and let's say it was Google's problem if it wasn't Google's problem

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:48.030
Then I would I would be looking at our code and going okay

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:55.470
How do we make it Google's problem because it is a better user experience in my humble opinion to just let Google manage the updates

00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:03.010
but if it if it is already Google problem and so maybe

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:09.270
Maybe Google only does the update, you know once a day or does that check?

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.730
Once a day and and the app just updated three seconds ago

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:18.030
Right. The app is telling me hey, I need to be updated

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:26.430
That situation what I would do is is is talk to Google and say hey, how do we make this experience more seamless?

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:29.960
right the

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
You're right

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.040
customers have update

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.360
fatigue

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:42.330
But what I'm saying is that doesn't mean you stand on the principle and say we don't do updates

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.450
No, we figure out how to do the updates and we remove the fatigue

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:54.500
Absolutely, and you see all kinds of apps do that. It's pretty common now for apps to have an update or

00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:01.920
To just download silently or and install patch style updates in the background. I think it's totally expected

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:09.760
It's okay, let's hear on Windows and every damn single one of them requires a reboot and that's annoying, too

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.320
Yeah, okay. Get my windows jab in. Okay

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.460
Let me summarize

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:23.940
Data is important. It it means you actually care more about the customer not less about them

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.540
It's actually a more efficient way to evaluate

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.620
the customers perception of value or customers

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.970
Yeah value of the product

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:35.970
one thing to bring up here is

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:41.290
People ask me what's different about modern testing versus agile testing and this it's a lot the same

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:46.010
It's a lot about whole team delivery. One of the things we really call out that's

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:53.850
not called out explicitly or at least not that much in the agile testing books is this use of data and how important it is because

00:50:54.210 --> 00:51:00.730
You and I and people who believe modern testing principles and a lot a lot a lot of engineering teams around the world

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:04.490
realize that data is critical to

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.530
Understanding and using data is critical to understanding

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:11.290
customer quality and production

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:14.130
Using data, so you just made a point using data

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:20.970
It I forget how you say it but some of the lines of it is not actually harming the customer

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:25.010
It is actually better for the customer. Right, right? Am

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:29.890
And still and just because it allows you to

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:37.740
Scale up your let's say it's a pure traditional testing

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:46.310
Facility it allows you to scale up your testing resources on the things that actually matter to the customer. Yes

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.270
Right, you can help you target your testing. Yes

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.370
absolutely

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:58.150
Yeah, and what might maybe let me add this metaphor

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:04.190
Well, if you have time is in the old days way back in the 20th century

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:10.560
We may look at code coverage and we'd figure out where we had missing tests

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.800
And we still do this today in our unit test and go make sure we have tests for the areas that don't have coverage

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.020
We can use data in a similar way to understand if you look at customer

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:27.140
Usage patterns as a method of coverage. You can look and see where they're using the product and make sure

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:33.180
We have and actually that may help you target. Okay customers are really using this 30% of the product

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:39.600
Let's go invest some of that time-intensive intellectual exploratory testing there. How about this?

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.810
How about it? You set up an experiment that

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:53.850
Routes 10% of the traffic to a co coverage instrumented build. Yes. I've done that before

00:52:54.690 --> 00:53:02.310
Right, and then you compare the co coverage of your test suite to the co coverage coming from your usage suite

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.250
Yep, fantastic

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:12.270
Now that means now you have a decision, right? Okay. Should you solidify where there's existing co coverage or

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:16.230
Do you fill the holes?

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:19.300
right, so if you see that that oh

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:24.520
This one one class is just used like freakin crazy

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:32.470
But there's a couple of lines of code that don't have testing right you maybe you you bolster up that unit test before you

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:40.070
You cover the test suite that that usage doesn't even hit right?

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:46.600
Matter of fact, I would I'll tell you what I would do in that particular case. I'd like hey

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.480
Do we have this feature turned on?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.760
Right. There's this whole library that's not even touched

00:53:54.690 --> 00:54:00.330
First off is it is it actually instrumented? Do we screw up when we deploy this thing? But assuming it is

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:04.630
Right. What is this code doing? Is it turned on?

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:07.600
if so

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.270
Okay

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:13.470
There's something wrong with it because customers can't find it customers aren't using it

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:20.590
Let's figure out if actually this is something we should continue. Yeah, that's an example of we're gonna look at the data and and

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:25.310
Prove or disprove our hypotheses on how we think the product works and it's being used

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.430
Yeah, the

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:30.610
You know another way of making

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.710
higher

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:36.990
Quality code here and talking about code correctness another way of making high quality code

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:42.390
one of my employees says and I like this the difference between a a

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.160
four star and a five star developer

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:48.420
five star developer

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:53.770
Doesn't add code. They remove it. That would be one attribute. Yeah. All right

00:54:54.130 --> 00:55:00.930
Okay, I hope we have beat our opinions and thoughts on data and it's important into your heads and next time

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.650
We'll cover the to some not all slightly controversial

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:12.080
Principle number seven. Okay, I am still Alan and I'm Brent and we'll see you next time
