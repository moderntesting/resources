WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
What I want to do, let me just talk through how I turned the corner on this.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.040
Which was 100 and 100 million billion

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.280
kazillion percent in agreement.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.520
And this is a man who knows his numbers.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.640
Welcome to A.B.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.720
Testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.560
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.680
on testing, leadership, agile and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.880
Now on with the show.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.720
Hey, everybody. Howdy.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.790
Alan, you're lovely.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.390
I'm love.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.790
I'm lovely. Yeah. Who are you?

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.590
I'm Brent.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590
Brent, you're a lovely host.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.360
Yeah, I'm uncomfortable with the term lovely.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.360
I like this.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.840
You know what? You're going to have to go with it.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.880
You know what we're going to do today?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.960
No, make a podcast that's better than the one we made last time.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.360
Continuous improvement.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.320
Yeah, that's that's that should be an easy to achieve.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.240
Yeah. Retros are important. We retro.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.640
We say, you know what? Let's do better.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.400
So we're going to do that. We're going to do better.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640
So how you been? What's new? What's exciting?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.600
It's just coming up.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.400
Not a thing for me, but whatever.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.350
Chocolate Bunny Day.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.310
Is that what it is?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.110
Yeah, I think it's chocolate Bunny Day.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.750
Well, if you if you play Animal Crossing, then it literally is.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.990
Bunny Day coming up.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.670
I don't play Animal Crossing.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.750
Oh, all right.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.550
Do you Animal Cross?

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.590
I did. I'm not currently.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.350
We got a whole community at Unity.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.670
It's like they have a shared spreadsheet of what they make and everything.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.830
And it's they're into it.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.350
Yeah, we've talked about this before.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.310
Anyway, go on.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.990
Do you even have a switch?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.870
No, there's there switches in the house.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.150
I don't have one that I claim as my own.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.830
Like Nintendo switch.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.910
I know what you're talking about.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.270
Yes, a Nintendo switch.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.750
No. So so there's like a bunch of I'm not as dumb as I look, Brent.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.950
What data do you have to back that up?

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.530
All right. Well, we'll just go for it.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.690
All right.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.490
So that'll be a continuously disproved or not yet proven.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.130
All right.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.450
People are doubting our opening statement of doing a better podcast already.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.730
No, but it's going to be higher energy, therefore, just by definition better.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.330
How can two old farts like us have high energy?

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.410
Coffee. Oh, yes, I did.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.250
Yeah, yeah. So were you I have stuff to say, but I can't remember

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.130
if you were saying anything or not.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.730
No. So, and I'm a long story short, I played a lot of Animal Crossing.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.610
There's really I've now played it enough that there's really no more sort of goals

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.730
to achieve, like there's not any sort of like achievement points.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.770
Like there is an Xbox.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.930
There are all these other little sort of achievements you can do.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.850
And I've kind of done them.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.210
So my my my game of today on the switch is one known as Hades.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.410
Oh, yes. This is a hard game.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.490
I've played this. You've played Hades.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.160
Yeah. On Xbox. Yeah.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.200
Yeah. So like right now I'm on my 150th run.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.200
I have yet to beat Hades himself.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.840
I have I was bummed by the last time because I almost got him down to the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.120
to the second one and I'm like, oh, I'm going to do it.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.800
Oh, I'm dead. Yeah.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.040
So for those who are not as nerdy as us,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.800
Hades is a game where you start off your character.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.840
You're you are the son of Hades, who ancient Greek God

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.960
who controls essentially the Greek version of hell.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.440
And you are tired of living in hell

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.520
and you are trying to get out.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.720
And Hades has insisted that no one gets out.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.440
I am playing a game where I'm continuously trying to just prove this

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.240
and continuously fail anyway.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.640
One bit of news for me is kind of hilarious.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.520
I think I mentioned last time I was traveling to Montreal for a team offsite.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.340
Yes. Yeah, that's not happening.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.620
Montreal got nixed for some reason.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.100
I can't remember.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.780
I was out so I can't remember what I went on a bike ride last week.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.220
We're right about 200 miles.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.740
Anyway, Montreal was canceled.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.020
I came back. It was going to be Miami.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.020
And then we found out the Miami Grand Prix is the weekend.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.300
The week were there. So I talked.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.380
I think I think I think I think I think I've talked my manager

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.580
into doing it in Los Angeles, a much closer plane ride for me.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.180
And I don't care about anybody else.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.740
So I go somewhere, you know, travel somewhere, go and travel on a plane.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.260
So that's kind of it for me.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.900
Work, work, work, bike, ride, bike, ride, bike, ride.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.900
Yeah, that's it.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.780
I have a question about work.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.180
If you want to get into the podcast proper in record time.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.180
Just sure.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.100
But I'll just do one last thing.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.940
I just looked it up and apparently Fallout 5

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.100
won't be out until at least 2025.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.180
Oh, yeah. Anyway. All right. Let's go.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.340
Should I? Should I preorder it now?

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.340
Um, I don't know. I don't think so.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.260
If it's anything like Fallout 76, the answer would be no.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.220
I played 15 minutes of Fallout 76.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.180
And when like not when it came out, like maybe it was over winter break.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.770
Oh, just like three months ago or whatever it was.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.770
Oh, so the news I haven't tried, but the news is saying

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.560
that it sucks way less.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.800
Yeah, it wasn't too bad. I just I just lost interest.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.360
So I have a question.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.750
It's actually hearkens back to a few of our earlier podcasts.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.350
For those of you that may remember, at one point I worked at Microsoft,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.030
small little software company in Redman where Brent remains employed,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.630
as far as we know, and probably while we were there together,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.950
Microsoft went through at least three, if not 12,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.790
different iterations of employee performance programs.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.090
And they still use the Connect.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.290
Is that today's thing still?

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.050
That's a record for how long they've used that.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.530
Because I've been around for about three or four years when I left.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.770
And I don't recall anything being used that long.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.170
But yeah, they they haven't changed Connect in a long time.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.370
This year and literally in the last month, it is the first time

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.650
they released. I don't even know the name of it.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.930
It's employee. I think it's employee signals is what it's called.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.050
It's the dramatic replacement to MS Polls.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.450
Oh, we use a third party culture thing called Culture app.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.210
We just finished up our poll today.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.890
In fact, I will let you know confidential unity information.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.050
I'm going to get busted by comms for this.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.930
My team had 94 percent participation.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.330
Wow. Looks like that's as far as reading it.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.730
So not bad, huh? Not bad.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.450
That so I did not.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.370
All right. So anyway, the Connect is the the employee review thing, et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.450
We talked about the toxicity that can generate when people are more concerned

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.330
about getting their own goals done.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.170
We used to joke at Microsoft around peak in May because that connect you do

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.170
because all the pay stuff is done in June.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.130
And and then the straw, one of the straws that broke the camel's back with me

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.130
was my manager making up stuff in my connect that never happened or he never told me.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.570
I said, OK, I'm done. But so all that happens.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.250
It's very awkward and weird about I can't remember how long ago.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.130
Maybe I won't get there yet.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.610
I've talked before about Unity's three Q system of feedback.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.570
So three questions, three times a year.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.810
What is your mission or why is your mission important?

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.570
What are you doing to achieve your mission?

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.470
And how's it going?

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.950
Just sort of the framing for a reflective one on one,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.270
looking at the work and opportunity for feedback.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.590
As we grow, we're seeing the need for more opportunities for feedback.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.910
And so we're building in we're building a goal setting system

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.590
and which set off my Spidey sense and red flags at first.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.950
I was furious.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.270
I can share that.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.670
I do not want a performance management system.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.990
My organization gives feedback just fine.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.300
As I've lived with it, we haven't visited a soft launch.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.940
I'm an official thing to like forever from now.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.500
But as I've sat with it and thought about it and talked about it,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.300
I'm feeling a lot better about it.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:52.920
And I think it's possible to have a healthy culture and organization

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.120
and still have these goals you can work on.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.520
In fact, you can even do better if you do goals in the right way.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.680
But the reason I want to I'll talk a little about my ideas,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.360
but we want to bring it up to you because in our conversations

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
in the past, you have said that Microsoft is getting better

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.880
in some of the toxicity that I experienced when I was there.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.880
And of course, there's pockets.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.140
It's a huge freaking company.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.260
Can you talk a little bit from what you can?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.780
And we'll both have to be a little bit nonspecific in some areas, I'm sure.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.660
But I think I think we can be fairly transparent on

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.100
how do you approach that goal setting with your employees?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.620
And I mean, how do you come up with good goals?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.940
What makes up a good goal?

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.500
And I'll jump in and add some flavor as we go through.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.500
But let me let me kick off with that question.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.780
Oh, what was your first one?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.860
So you said what makes a good goal?

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.220
Well, there's a good goal.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.540
And really, how do you approach setting goals with your employees?

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.020
Oh, what I will do is I'll share with you.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:01.450
So there's a bar that I have set very high for the principal band.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.770
So at Microsoft, we have multiple bands, but the most popular,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:13.890
most populated bands are in order, just simply a one.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.930
So you could be a PM one or a software engineer one or a data science one.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.250
Or you could be a two.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.010
Or you could be the natural that is a senior.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.930
And then after that is a is a principal.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.610
And then lastly, after that is a partner.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.290
You weren't a partner when you left, right?

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.610
You were still principal.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.610
Yeah, I was 67 in Microsoft terms.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.770
I was a principal.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:40.810
Yep, I am.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.450
I am a principal myself now.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:49.810
And so when I have conversations with and I'm not entirely meandering,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.850
but when I have conversations with my seniors

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.730
who are who their next promotion would move them into the principal band,

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:06.330
I start off with a setting expectations on the principal band as follows.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.620
OK, so you want to go to principal.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:16.250
What I want you to do is think about what KPI

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.220
that the business cares about that you want to own.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.280
And then they look at me befuddled.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:26.860
What do you mean?

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.820
Own like I'm already I'm already driving a bunch of KPIs.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.100
I'm like, no, no, no, no.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.620
Here's what own means.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.860
You're going to you're going to say, Brit, I want the food KPI.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.020
And then I say, OK, great.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.000
Start working through.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.760
I want to I want you to start working through your strategy

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.840
around how you're going to move it.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.880
And then I'm going to be basically hands off.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.440
That's what own means.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.800
I want you to practice moving needles.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.280
Yeah, that's I'm going to jump in because that's a it's not

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.230
I don't know if we've got into the setting goals part directly.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:07.030
Maybe we're getting there, but yeah, that's I've had a very similar conversation.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:14.590
So the levels that every company has a very similar growth of or leveling system.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.910
They're not all identical.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.590
For example, if I look at levels, not FYI, I see that it's about makes sense.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.630
What we call principal or director

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:30.350
is the top end of sixty six, sixty seven and all of sixty seven at Microsoft.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.890
And when I'm talking to those folks, a little little higher up.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:41.080
But I tell them at at that level, you have to run your business.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.360
Yes, that your business could be small. Right.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.120
But that's and that's what I'm kind of trying to drive them to

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.000
is basically understand, no, when you're the owner, you are

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.520
essentially part of the business team

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.440
and you are going to specifically drive improvements in this thing.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.250
They're like, well, but wait a minute, that KPI multiple teams are like, no, no.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:17.570
Scope it down and and to something that is drivable.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.170
But getting to goal setting.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:25.170
So the at the very top level, the reason why I told the story is at the very top level,

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.570
I'm very explicit. What's the KPI? You're going to move.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.210
You're a senior now.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.970
You should have everything you need underneath your belt.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.810
Like one of my expectations around the senior band

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.010
is that they have learned to master leadership.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.390
Right. And leadership is the ability to get people to follow you,

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.830
not do what you say.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.950
Follow you. Very distinct difference.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.270
You should also at that, depending on your role, you should also have at that point in time

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.750
has sufficient skill set in whatever band you are.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.790
If you're a developer, like you probably know all the coding

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.140
you need to know at at 64.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.740
Sure, there might be other things that are that would be fun to learn.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.540
Always learning support.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.580
But it's enough to give the team trust in your ability to lead them.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.020
And I keep on thinking when you say followers, I keep on thinking of the Maxwell

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.780
levels of leadership and there's you're put in a position of leadership

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.340
and then people give you permission to lead them.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.340
And I really like that. It's like, yeah, you can I trust you.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.420
I trust you to help me figure out the path.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.540
We just had a reorg and and I picked up a couple of people

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.540
and part of my first speech because you shrunk it last time we talked to you

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:49.570
and shrunk. Yeah. And it's it's back up and circle of life still growing.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.290
Yeah, it's it's a headache because

00:14:53.730 --> 00:15:00.210
right for me, Brent needs the right balance of talky and dewy.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.050
And right now I am over pivoting on talk.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.730
I'm too much talky right now.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.890
And it's it's I'm working on it.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.810
So I want to jump in and I like where you're going.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.250
But I'm going to I realize I can be more specific here and help out here.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.810
So by talking about you want to talk about commitments?

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.090
No, I mean, you commitments goals.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.290
So here is the deal.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:27.090
And I can compare Microsoft and kind of where some of my my rage flare up came in.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.890
Like, oh, we're going to have goals.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.770
And I'm not saying goals are bad.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.970
Goals are good. But things change so quickly.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.010
At Microsoft, the commitments were they yearly, twice yearly.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.490
It's really hard because stuff changes super fast these days.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:50.330
So what would happen is people would either set very vague goals,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.380
which you could morph into success no matter what.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:16:00.020
And it's hard to tell if you're hard to coach on those or very specific goals

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.060
or or more, I think very even more specific goals that may become irrelevant

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.660
a few months down the road.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.620
So how do you go about setting goals or commitments?

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.100
With your team to to avoid falling into either of those two traps

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.340
or those traps, OK?

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.140
Enumerate again, the two traps.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.140
So vague that you can't tell if you've made progress or not.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.380
So you can make shit up the the what I thought was the canonical Microsoft model

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.100
or an amount of specificity that if anything changes,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.500
that goal is irrelevant, just just becomes an A or not done.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.070
So nowadays with goals,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.940
here is what I here is a major difference,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.900
I would say, about the current Microsoft thing.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.660
OK, Microsoft doesn't care about goals.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.420
We have these things called commitments, but we don't care about goals.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.100
You get reviewed on impact.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.740
And I think that's the key. Go on.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.020
I like that better.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:07.940
The problem is, as it stands right now, the term impact

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.460
is kind of because there's still too many, you know, old timers here.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.380
The term impact is just becoming a synonym for for goal

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.220
in in in the old world that existed when you were still here.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:31.490
OK, the like this idea of of of committing

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:38.220
to something, to committing to something that you've written in your connect.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.700
That is something that has died down.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.100
And for me, it makes more sense.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.540
But this idea of committing to

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.260
shipping this feature by this date, right, you go and look up smart goals

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.460
and they'll tell you, oh, yeah, that's a fantastic goal.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.940
But committing to it, and at least in my world,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.100
is just absolutely nonsensical.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.940
I heard a great quote about smart goals on a podcast today.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.780
The quote was everybody knows about smart goals, but nobody's excited about them.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.180
Yeah, because smart, the smart goals and I

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:24.580
actually you've been long ago, a manager of mine, Damien.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.540
Ah, Damien Lindauer.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.740
Where can I sit on LinkedIn?

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.340
I just doxed Damien. Sorry, man.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:35.220
No, do you remember there was a there was one time I called you in

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.780
to do a presentation at a at a Damien team meeting?

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.820
And then I at that same meeting, I presented around

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.060
smarter goals like I've done.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.340
So I created my own acronym Smarter Goals.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.820
So anyone can go up and look up smart on the Internet.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:59.460
I had a measurable, actionable result oriented and time bound, something like that.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.940
Relevant and time bound.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.140
Yeah. And then I added an E.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.400
So everyone know a

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:18.660
the A stands for actionable in some places or attainable in other places.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.260
Or astonishing. The E.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.460
Or sometimes Alan.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.020
So the E I added was exceedable.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.660
Though can you get past it?

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.500
Can you can you overachieve?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.420
Right. Right.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.540
If if if you are because one of the big problems at Microsoft at that point in time,

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.070
if you had the goal that wasn't exceedable, then right.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.350
Your goals are setting you up for a three.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.030
OK, tell me the R that I want to react.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.000
Reasonable set.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.080
OK, so you smart has you go through these goals.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.240
Right. But if and you could create an individual

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.160
goal, but if you have too many of these goals,

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.520
then you're diluting your effort.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.720
Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.880
You can't have multiple.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.920
But let me give you some reaction because my the part that doesn't sit well

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.920
with being the part I will ignore and fight and do my own way

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.440
is tying those goals to pay.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.940
We can tie the impact to pay.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.700
So what I want to do, so let me let me just talk through my

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:30.580
how I turn the corner on this, which 100 and 100 million billion,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.820
gazillion percent in agreement.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.460
And this is a man who knows his numbers.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.140
So what I want to use the goals for, and this is where

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.100
the Connect stuff comes up three times a year, sometimes two.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.140
Is that right?

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.220
It doesn't matter.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.500
What I've decided is I will get goals from my whole org,

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.340
starting with my direct reports, and we will check in on the

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.500
and we're going to get some wrong.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.780
We're going to practice doing it because it takes some practice

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.020
to get it right, as you know.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.740
And we're going to check in on them regularly.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.500
Maybe not every one on one, but at least once a month

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.620
because they provide a ton of coachable moments and times

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.540
where you can give specific feedback.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.900
Here's a challenge with feedback.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.300
If I go to my manager, actually, my manager doesn't know how

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.500
to get feedback, bad example.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.940
But if I were to go to my manager hypothetically and say,

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.340
do you have any feedback for me?

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.620
He'd be like, uh, yeah, when you ask for feedback,

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.820
it should be around specific things.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.340
Do you have any feedback on the delivery of component A to team X?

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.500
And then hopefully we can get that.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.300
Then what this does is having goals that we work through

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.220
can give us some opportunities for feedback.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.250
And then my model here is I'm not really into smart.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.090
I am time bound, not worried about smarter,

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.090
but remember the unity three questions.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.570
Why is your mission important is the first one.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:51.090
And I find I'm a disciple of Dan pink as much as I am

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.330
of Eric Reese.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.810
And if people have autonomy, mastery, and purpose,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.650
and I give people autonomy and I balance that

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.290
with accountability and transparency,

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.480
but I give them freedom to run their own business.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.400
I make sure they have the skills to do

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.360
what they need to do, mastery.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.800
And purpose is so important.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.800
I want everyone to feel like their role and their job

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.360
and what they do is important.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.840
So we start with that question.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.320
And then from there, move into what are some things

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.100
that you want to accomplish to help achieve this mission?

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.860
And we come up with two or three goals sometimes

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.100
and it kind of depends on level and experience.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.420
Someone more junior, they may be shorter term,

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.580
one month goals.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.700
Someone more seniors like by the end of Q2 or Q3

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.460
or by the end of 22, they need to accomplish this.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.220
And then they'll go through and break it down.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.300
Like what are the milestones?

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.780
It's almost like objective and key results for the goal.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.060
We'll have a goal, like what are the things

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.100
I need to accomplish to make sure I'm working toward this?

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.660
And those are the things we can check in on.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.740
And then finally, after we kind of get through

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.340
that little exercise, it doesn't take long.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.620
I make sure that those goals represent both

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.740
what they want to do for the business

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.140
as well as their personal growth

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.180
and or growth in that, whatever they want to do.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.340
Does this feel like it moves you forward?

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.300
Remember the old ACB model.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.300
A certain amount of your work is above you

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.460
and stretches you.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.060
Some is just stuff you're good at that you do.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.780
And then there's a little bit of grunt work.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.220
We want the below work.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.300
We want to minimize that and find the right balance

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.980
between stuff that stretches you

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.380
and stuff you're just good at.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.740
What happens if you don't have any stuff

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.970
that stretches you, Brent?

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.730
You burn out and die.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.740
You're bored as fuck.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.580
Yeah.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.140
So remember Microsoft used to accuse me

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.060
of changing jobs every 18 months,

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.140
which I deny, but it turned out being kind of true.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.780
I didn't accuse you.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.220
I was just putting out the facts.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.700
Damn data people.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.060
But what happened was in every single one of those cases,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.780
except for the last one, which is special,

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.220
I was bored.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.500
There wasn't really anything challenging left for me

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.580
to do in that role.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.060
So I wanted to do something else.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.060
I, in hindsight, I have found

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.960
that there were two primary reasons for me leaving.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.840
One of them is, yeah, bored as hell.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.200
Bored, bored, boredy, boredy, bored, bored, bored.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.200
The other one is not bored, love what I'm doing,

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.790
but there is a critical problem within the organization

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:35.590
that I have attempted to do my part to fix.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:41.510
And just not only is it done on track to get fixed,

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.230
it's not going to be fixed.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:49.230
And I have a big problem staying in broken orcs.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.870
I'm like, oh my God, it's gonna drive me

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.270
incredibly insane on a daily basis.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.750
It depends how broken and how much ability you have

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.790
to fix what's broken.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.910
If it's a hopeless cause, yeah, I would get out.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.870
I mean, we are so fricking lucky to be able to work

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.710
in an industry where we can have jobs

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.430
that are fun and challenging.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.150
I am sharing on my screen right now.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.130
For those of you not watching the closed captioning version

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:23.130
of this podcast, Brent has a screen full of Venn diagrams

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.630
and other charty looking things.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.470
I'm going to explain it to you,

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.190
my beloved listener in a second.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.450
And Alan, I'm gonna focus his attention on this.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:40.450
This is a diagram that controls 90% of the time

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:46.090
of my one-on-ones with my staff.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.890
So can I attempt to describe this for our listeners?

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.890
Cause I think you are on the money.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.970
You have found, you have the diagram close at hand,

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.730
which represents what I just mentioned.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:01.730
So this is a three circle Venn diagram of what we do well,

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:07.220
what we want to do and what we can be paid to do.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.700
And smack dab in the middle of the intersection

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.790
of those three circles is hooray.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:15.630
Right.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.030
And we should all, I mean, knowledge workers rejoice.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.550
Knowledge workers have the ability to seek out

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.970
and find that role.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:23.950
It's not always easy.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.270
And sometimes it's a little bit in the outskirts,

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.230
but we're lucky.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.670
And so I will talk to them and I will go through

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:35.150
and say, okay, we can talk to them.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.110
Or like I just picked up a couple of employees.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.870
I know I've erased it now.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.950
Otherwise I'd prove to you that right over there

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.430
on that whiteboard where it says,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.510
predict risks and mitigate, I had drawn the circle.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.810
I've been using this thing for years

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.800
in terms of my one-on-ones and say, okay,

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.580
so where are we?

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.920
Where are you with this particular task?

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.400
Where are you on the task of growing your career

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.180
in this diagram?

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.180
Now, circling it back to the goals, right?

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.380
The reason why I brought up that top level KPI

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.720
is that's what I do when people are going in

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.340
or are part of the principal band.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.660
And then you would imagine that at the lower bands,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.580
I'm basically training them up to get to the point

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.180
where I can have that conversation

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.760
when they're principal band.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.260
Like at the level two, their job,

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.260
in my view, their job is execution excellence.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.220
You have to get shit done.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.340
At senior band, your job is to figure out how to lead.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.380
And in this case, I don't even care how you're leading.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.740
It could be a technical leader, it could be a people leader,

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.700
you could be a strategic leader.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.100
I don't care.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.980
My only bar is that you have evidence

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.320
that there are people following you.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.380
And as you correctly called out,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.550
a follower is someone that's making a choice.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.590
Like they don't have to choose to walk your path.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.590
Now, on goals, I particularly,

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:17.830
now I am lucky to be in a space where I can do a lot,

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.980
I can go a lot of different directions, right?

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.060
My space is customer analytics.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.580
Like we've talked about that before

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.700
and I can go deep on a lot of places

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.660
because it turns out in the software industry,

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.220
it turns out a lot of things are about the customer

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.770
if you look at it right.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.930
Right, Am.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.050
I'm sorry, a podcast, did you hear my eyes roll on that one?

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.370
Did that come across on the microphone?

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.810
Anyway, go on, sorry.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.650
What I try to do with this diagram is to go,

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.770
okay, let's talk about intrinsic motivators.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:58.340
What is it that you want to do?

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.800
Whether it be work related or not work related,

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.000
what is your passion?

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.790
What is driving you?

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:11.290
And what subset of those things

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.290
can I help you get paid to do?

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:20.290
You said you very clearly enjoyed riding your bike.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.570
Like I remember stories from your college days

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.330
where you were a pizza delivery

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.650
and I think you said that you did it through bike riding.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.250
No, I was a, I delivered pizza by car

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.370
but I was a bicycle messenger.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.250
Oh, bicycle messenger, that's right.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.810
I delivered anything from mail to blood.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.450
Yeah, I mixed up.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.890
I just combined your before Microsoft job history, I think.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.050
So you have an interest in riding bikes.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.290
Well, unfortunately, like if you were to be

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.750
a future employee on my team,

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:59.390
I can't yet figure out how your passion there

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.890
might be something that I could combine

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.570
with a lot of the work that we're doing.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.450
But if I can, I'm gonna tap into it

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:12.450
because I have learned happy people are productive people.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.050
Yes, yes.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.690
And in fact, you and I have arrived

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.490
at the exact same destination via different routes.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.850
We were talking about our engagement survey earlier

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.210
or as used to be MS Pulse has a new name for you,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.730
MS Insights.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.730
These are measurements of employee engagement.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.090
And I don't care what the survey says,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.330
I want to make sure people are happy about their work.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.570
And then of course, the study from Pat Lanchoni

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.530
in The Advantage, finding massive correlation

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.890
between a healthy organization

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.050
and the quality of the products they deliver,

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.930
regardless of the industry, it all ties together.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.850
Our part of our job as managers is to not just get people

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:59.250
to get their work done, it's connect them with their work,

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.850
make it important for them

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.930
or find the work that's important for them.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.210
And then the good things in the delivery

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.610
and the velocity and all the things we want will happen.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:14.450
My job as a manager is to get to the point

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:18.910
where I do not have to manage, right?

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.390
It's essentially, how do I light a fire?

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:26.230
How do I show them that they can achieve

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.470
a business impactful goal at the same time

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.910
as develop things that they want to do?

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.670
Yeah, so this is where, again, I've turned the corner

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.630
from us not having a specific goal setting process

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.870
before at Unity to where I'm at now thinking,

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.190
first thinking it was horrible and now thinking,

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.430
you know what, if we use this right,

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.430
I can actually do the things I've been trying to do

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:52.910
much more effectively.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.870
It just took me a while to get there

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.630
because I had been tainted by some poor goal setting

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.270
processes that I've been part of in the past.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.790
I'm not clear on what you're classifying as goals, right?

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.510
Because you already have language,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.550
like in your questions,

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.790
you already have language around mission.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.950
It's reflection.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.950
The previous questions are more reflecting back.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:15.910
What is my mission?

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.070
What have I done to achieve my mission?

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.790
How have I done in achieving my mission?

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.830
All I'm doing now is twisting that a little bit forward.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.230
What else, what are the next things I want to accomplish

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.550
in order to achieve this mission?

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.670
So in goals and in your context,

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.550
are they more rallying cries?

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.270
Are they more North stars?

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.310
concrete goals.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.710
Let me make up one that's probably,

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.270
I could probably just let me get away with it.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:47.940
I will kick Alan in the shins by end of year.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.780
Here's one.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.540
Here's one for my one I play, I should be safe.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.420
We'll have a pipeline for pseudo localization available

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.340
in all of our build pipelines by the end of Q3.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.500
Okay.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.060
That's probably too much jargon.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:05.060
My team will reduce test time by 25% by the end of Q2.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.540
Okay.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.180
So pretty concrete stuff, not North star.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.300
And I'll, but those goals all require a multitude of things

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.390
be done to complete them.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:16.430
Okay.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.190
Now, is that goal a commitment?

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.700
No, it's a goal.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.540
Okay.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.250
So what happens if you don't achieve the goal?

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:25.490
It depends.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.330
Yeah.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.090
See, I think you see where that comes from.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.650
What we can do is we're not,

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.650
I'm not going to wait till the end of Q2 to go,

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.490
did you hit it?

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.310
Did you not hit it?

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.150
Okay.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:35.990
Here's your grade.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.650
We'll have a discussion regularly and maybe it's Q3.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.010
I'm making up stuff here,

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.330
but we're going to have a regular check-in.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.410
How's this going?

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.130
What are the next things you need to accomplish?

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.970
I have traditionally done OKRs with my team

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.090
without telling them they're doing OKRs

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.450
because once they know they're doing OKRs,

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.570
it gets all messed up and I have experience of this.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.250
So I'll approach it very similarly.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.610
Although these aren't OKRs to that.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.210
I will ask, we'll check in on it.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:06.410
What are the top priorities for this goal for next week?

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.890
What's coming up over the next month or so?

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:11.210
That's the check-in on it.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.710
And if you're not achieving it

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.110
because you're getting distracted

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.090
or just leave the OKRs out,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.050
if you're not achieving it because you're distracted

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.170
or you didn't feel like doing it

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.850
or you've become disengaged on it

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.290
or you made a big mistake in the wrong direction

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.760
and that was preventable

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.800
or maybe you went and did something I asked you not to do.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.840
For whatever reason,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.760
those things are a different sort of feedback than

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.080
we did all the right things.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.080
It ended up being, that last 5%

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.200
ended up being much harder than we thought.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.880
That's what I mean by it depends.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.080
So we're going to talk about,

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.480
the difference is we're not going to wait

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.040
till the end of the time bound to bring it up.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.240
OK, here's your deadline for this goal.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.440
How did it go?

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.040
It gives us a framing for ongoing conversations

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.560
which are going to provide opportunities

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.470
for feedback and coaching.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.430
Yeah, so my...

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.030
So I kind of don't care if you hit the goal or not.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.630
What I care is we can have meaningful conversations

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.630
about doing the work you've committed,

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.470
use your word, you've committed or set out to do.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.950
Yeah, sorry, you were going to say something.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:15.790
I got to say it.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:19.070
Yeah, so I understand

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.110
what you described at the beginning of the conversation

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.110
as, I'll just reframe as anxiety

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:32.190
or frustrated or upset in some regards.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.670
Because I'm just like,

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.430
oh my God, that is a slippery slope

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.550
to just death spiral doom.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.390
And I must do everything to avoid it.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:45.270
Like I'm vicariously living that emotion through...

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.110
And that's what happened at Microsoft.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.590
It got, it would get to be a month before goal time.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.990
And you would screw your teammates in the back

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.710
with an iron spike just to make sure

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.710
you got your stuff done you committed to.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.430
I care a lot less if you've reached your goal or not.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.750
Because what I also want,

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.030
what I want to reward you on is not just impact,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.510
but what I'm going to pay attention to

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.110
and we're going to get feedback throughout this thing

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.270
is the way in which you accomplish those goals.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.710
If you are doing it in a way

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.630
that's leaving bodies in the wake,

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.390
that's going to have an effect

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.070
on how I'm going to evaluate you.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.150
If you're doing it in a way that's inclusive

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.230
and involving other people and showing respect

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:23.110
and listening to everyone's ideas

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.510
and you're rocking out of the park,

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.830
I am going to rock you out of the park with a pay raise.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.460
Yeah, I don't like,

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:36.500
I don't like directly connecting those goals.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.460
Not connecting the goals,

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.980
I'm connecting the outcomes

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.540
and the way in which you achieve the outcomes.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.260
Yeah, so let me, oh, so many things.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.580
So we do have OQRs here at Microsoft,

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.620
but OQRs are never,

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.540
at least they haven't been in my team

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.820
or in my manager's team.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.820
They're not specifically in anybody's commitments.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.220
No, no, no, no, and I am against,

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.220
I mentioned the model, it's kind of like that,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.180
but I would never use an OQR for personal goals.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.020
No, an OQR serves a valuable purpose,

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:17.060
but it serves the purpose around a rallying cry

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.260
for a virtual team.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.820
And here's where people get stuck and screwed up

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.860
on OQRs for quick tangent.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.740
OQR is done right, as you mentioned, rallying cry.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.660
They are a massively valuable tool for alignment.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.500
Yes.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.940
People try and use them like scorecards

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.700
and they're just,

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.980
Yes, also yes.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.980
Although you just,

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.500
I'm thinking 99% of all the sentences

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.660
that you could ever say,

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.620
they can include the word scorecard,

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.860
I'm going to be against.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.060
As an aside, there's one of my meetings

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.780
where I've instituted a drinking game,

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.460
which is tough because it's an 8am meeting,

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.020
but every time someone says,

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.060
we should build a dashboard for that,

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.220
I faux slam a shot.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:01.230
Ha ha ha ha ha.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.550
Yeah, you know, it's been a while since we've,

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.710
we had our own version of that on the podcast.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.670
Like we've said this before.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.510
Yeah.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.190
All right, now,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.230
so I'm energized by this conversation

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.230
because I'm just like, oh my God,

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.990
no, yes, no, yes, no, no.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:21.510
Like for me,

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:26.110
I was also thinking through one of the reasons why,

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.990
so it's, for me,

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:30.630
goals of that nature,

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.370
like Q2, right?

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.770
I don't even communicate them as goals.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.330
I want to make sure people are understand, no.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.290
As it stands right now,

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.160
it is, that is my plan, okay?

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.240
But it's not a goal,

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.960
it's my plan.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.560
I'm okay with that.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.800
And I softened that communication

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.280
because of my, because again,

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.720
the business that I'm in,

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.800
and I can explain why that's important.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.930
Number one,

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:08.930
number two is my training on Kanban.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.330
Kanban has really said,

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:15.560
look, no, what I rather do

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.240
is start funding

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.460
the highest ROI thing

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.060
when I have idle people on my team.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.660
Like whatever is not yet started,

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.140
I want to start those things that have the highest ROI

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.980
and it may not be this pipeline

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.100
that handles all localized languages, right?

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.180
It may, and it may never be that.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.300
Right, that's a good goal.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.500
This goes back to the first thing I said was it's hard.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.340
If you get too specific and things change,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.860
or priorities change,

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.700
then that goal is like,

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.300
oh, I didn't do this goal, what happened?

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.820
So I like the idea of thinking of them as plans

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.780
and not goals.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.300
So that's a nugget I like,

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.690
because it takes care of that trap.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.650
Now it allows you to be specific to a point.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.770
If you know it's a plan

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.290
and you know that plans can change.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:16.940
And if the plan has to be committed,

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.700
then I have an even bigger problem

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.420
because like as most of our listeners know,

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.900
I am an Azure, Azure is a service.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.720
And a lot of big design upfront

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.520
just does not make sense in this space.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.720
It just does not.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.840
We have to be adaptable and failing to be adaptable.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.960
We end up being interrupt driven then

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.760
because there are higher priority things,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.480
higher urgency things that are constantly coming in.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.520
Well, again, again, going back to why I wanna check in

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.720
on these frequently, super frequently

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.080
is so that we can deliver frequently, super frequently.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.200
I don't want someone to say,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.040
here's my goal for the end of QTQ3.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.960
And mine are made up of it

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.680
and my people are listening slightly.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.200
But I don't want you to just deliver the whole thing

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.550
at once and say, okay, done.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.870
What we're gonna talk about

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.110
as we look at these, like,

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.710
what's the minimum first step?

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.950
What's our MVP?

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.070
What do we need to do?

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.630
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.750
So absolutely using that.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.030
And I'm stealing stuff from your combine.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.270
We get to a stage where like your combine question is,

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.190
I think, tell me if I'm wrong,

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.070
what work is remaining to complete this task?

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.150
I can use a variation of that

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.150
to check as a method of checking in on these plans.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.670
Oh, you're talking about, yeah.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.070
What work is remaining to move this ticket,

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:45.910
one column to the right?

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:47.110
Oh, right, right.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.910
What needs to be done, right?

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:50.750
That's exactly right.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:55.750
But that framing could work for these plans as well.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.910
Right, but the other thing too,

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:02.670
the problem is, so that question works very well

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:06.030
for sort of tactical work, right?

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:10.150
When you talk about sort of goals or strategies, okay,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.830
I actually changed the question.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.910
I basically say, I am now at a point,

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.950
so do you remember the pivot or persevere conversation?

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.110
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.950
It from-

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.150
Yeah, I agree, Chapter 8.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.870
So now in a strategic sense,

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:30.510
I say what work remains

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.830
so that we can have a pivot or persevere discussion.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.910
And that pivot or persevere discussion

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.550
is part of that plan.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.300
And it may change the goal.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.220
That's fair, that's fair.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.700
And another thing I've been very clear about

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.860
is these things not being written in stone.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.820
I want to encourage my team to discard

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.980
or change these goals as needed as we get more context.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.820
Absolutely.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.500
I like adding pivot or persevere to that discussion as well.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.180
Up to and including abandon the goal.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.540
Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.100
I tell my team, look,

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.220
when you write this goal, like number one,

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.660
if anyone on my team said something like what you did,

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:17.230
like your pipeline by the end of Q3,

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.590
I would have just, I'm like, no, okay.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.190
Don't put the Q3 part, right?

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.230
I get what you're trying to say, okay?

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:29.510
But you're locking yourself into something

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.090
that may be abandoned, right?

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.170
Just saying remove,

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.610
I don't mind having the time bound bit on there,

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.330
but you're saying remove that.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.370
I just don't think it's realistic.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:40.450
That's fair.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.770
But that's in my business, right?

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:47.890
In what my team operates on on a day-to-day basis,

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.450
because I'm just like, oh.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:51.570
On the other hand,

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:54.370
it comes with psychological safety as well

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:58.850
because they may say this thing for Q2 or Q3 or Q4.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.490
And if they miss that date,

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.850
again, it's the impact outcome,

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.330
the way in which they accomplish that.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.370
They still need to,

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.330
they're stakeholders that may need these things

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.370
and practicing commitment

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.890
and doing so in a safe manner.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.810
If they miss a date, I'm not gonna get mad.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:21.570
I'm not gonna change their pay for missing in most cases.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:25.290
Depends on their effort and how they got there.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.730
But I wanna give them,

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:30.130
there's a short story, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.850
I want it to be safe for them

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:34.780
to fail in achieving their plans.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.340
So it's okay if they have a date

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.500
because it's a plan.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.060
It's a guess.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.740
And you know, we do P50.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.580
In fact, we do P50 estimates on our work items.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.260
I would say we have P50 estimates

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.020
on our goals slash plans as well.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.160
I will say I not only want them to feel safe.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.560
I'm, so my statement,

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.280
I'm trying to do it a clear fashion,

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.520
but my statement is a little bit more aggressive than yours.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.510
So I do want them to feel safe to fail.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:14.020
I want them to feel morally obligated,

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.380
business obligated, investor,

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.780
like something along those lines.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.980
I want them to feel obligated

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:25.580
that if this goal is to fail,

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.060
to fail it as fast as f'ing possible, right?

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:35.060
It's, I don't want you onion peeling for six months

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.300
and then then going, oh, well, my time's up.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.460
I failed.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:46.460
But again, again, I'm not gonna, it's, I think,

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.270
I think we're far more likely to be in agreement here.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:51.110
We are.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.470
This goes back to the point I made about checking in on like,

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.350
what's the logical next step?

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.710
If there are no, if they're going for a big bang delivery

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:01.400
at the end, that's gonna get some feedback right away.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.600
Right.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.880
I guess as long as we're making progress,

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.440
like what's the next step?

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.360
What's the, yeah, what's the next step?

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.800
What's the next bit of value we add?

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.440
I guess we can have that conversation.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.520
It might take some practice.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.360
I think, I think I'm okay with the dates,

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.960
but I can now see why you wouldn't have that.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.360
Again, it's gonna take some coaching to get there

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.720
to make sure because.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.840
I actually think you could take this and combine it.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.280
Okay. With what?

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:33.040
With our two philosophical ideologies.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.800
Come take what we talked about in terms of the goals

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.600
and then combine it with the three questions.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.480
So let's imagine one of your reports had this goal

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.730
and it's two weeks into something that's six months out.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.570
Right.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:53.330
I think it's important that you continuously check in

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:56.780
on those goals and say, all right,

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.860
what evidence do you have that your mission,

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.140
that this goal is still important?

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.740
Like I'll say from my point of view,

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.580
one of the biggest things that,

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.820
one of the biggest speeches,

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:12.820
I am delivering to leaders throughout the company

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:17.860
because I'm getting called in to sort of collaborate

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.420
as well as advise on multiple different projects now.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:27.300
And this one team came to me

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.700
and then I talked to their leader yesterday,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.900
or at night, talked to them last week

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.860
and talked to the leader above the set of group.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.100
And I said, you have a real big problem.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:44.870
And I said, your team is not,

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:47.470
they're busily going and doing something equivalent.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:50.510
Like I will build this pipeline for localization

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:54.000
or I forget what you said, but it's a great example.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.600
And I said, your team is not addressing

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.800
the very first and basic question.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.380
Why does the business care?

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.930
Why do we care?

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.050
So what?

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:05.890
You did this.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.730
How would this have been-

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.370
We have that as part of the goal setting

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:10.650
or plan setting session,

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:12.450
but I think what we can do as we go forward

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.530
is ask questions like,

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:17.820
is this still the highest priority for your team?

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:22.180
Well, you don't wanna start and then stop, right?

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.090
But it's, do we still,

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.690
with the best available information,

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:33.090
do we still expect to get the return

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.410
from this investment?

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.450
It's gonna be contextual on all these,

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:39.170
but I think there are,

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.490
I guess the short story is,

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.370
as long as we talk about these things regularly,

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:44.850
and I remember at Microsoft,

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.330
we would not look at these often

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.890
until the week before our connect,

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.290
we go, oh, shit, I said I'd do that.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.770
Huh, wonder what I did there.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.170
And so I like the idea of getting some plan,

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.130
get people used to setting some plans or goals,

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:03.170
reviewing them often,

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.650
figuring out what works and doesn't work,

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.170
both as far as goal setting and feedback

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:13.650
and trying all these things is all really powerful.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.810
And I guess the revelation I'm trying to share here

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.850
is I went from, oh God,

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.730
not a performance management system,

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:22.130
to, oh my God,

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.330
why didn't we have a performance management system?

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.330
It took me several months to get there

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.410
and a lot of reflection and a lot of thinking

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.250
and a lot of just kinda typing away,

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.290
trying to come up with a model that works.

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:36.290
And it sounds like from bouncing it off of you,

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:40.210
that we're aligned and it sounds like you've made it work,

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.650
so I'm feeling more like in a different model

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.290
that this should work,

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.370
but it's not gonna be easy,

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:47.850
it's gonna take effort.

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:50.610
The issue is, what are you managing

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:53.050
with the performance management system?

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.050
And-

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.330
See, that's the part I don't like thinking of it,

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:57.890
like a performance management system,

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.930
because it is, to me,

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:02.370
it's a guideline,

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:07.370
it's a method to achieve business impactful outcomes,

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.290
which I want to reward on,

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:16.000
I don't want to reward on the stuff we put into the tool.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.840
If it can be framed as an employee growth-

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.800
Yeah, that's how I'm framing it for my work.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.640
I don't even like the word management.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.040
No, I don't use that either.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.840
What did you call-

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.800
I like how I refer to it as,

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.320
we're gonna use it as a growth framework.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.960
Right, if it's a growth framework, I'm all aboard.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.680
To me, the second you add in the word management-

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.720
Nope, not adding that word.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.560
Right, it's command-

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.880
It was unveiled as a performance management system,

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.760
which hit my, I triggered, made my blood boil,

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.000
but now that I've embraced it

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.520
and looked inside the guts of it

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.040
and kind of made it what I think it can be,

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.240
it's a growth framework and that's how I'm gonna use it

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.440
and it's gonna be effective.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.280
So for me, summarizing, I think goals are great as long

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.240
because I think it's important for an individual

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.000
have a sense of where they wanna go.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.200
I do think that it's also important

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.880
to sort of train into that individual

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.520
and evaluation of what's gonna be the investment costs

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.520
and what is gonna be the expected return

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.040
and have an idea around the return.

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.640
Failing to do the return stuff, by the way,

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.120
is how you get all of these, build it

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.240
and they will come, science fair problems.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.560
Feel the dreams, bull crap, yeah.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.000
Right, and well, so hey, I spent six months doing this,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.400
now I'm gonna spend the next six months

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.440
setting up roadshow meetings

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.720
and see if I can get anyone to care.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.640
Nah, no, no, no, that's, again,

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.000
what I like about this is more chance

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.480
to check in frequently on how those things are going

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.640
to make sure none of those traps are falling into.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.000
And then again, my directs won't do that,

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.520
but I don't think, but in modeling that,

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.840
as this cascades down, they can catch those things as well.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.040
I think we can actually get,

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.480
I think good things are gonna happen,

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.320
but you know, I'll keep you all posted.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.960
Sweet. Sweet, man.

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.240
All right, well, that other topic,

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.960
we're gonna do that next time.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.800
Good.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.960
Because we, this was fun,

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.400
thank you for this conversation.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.360
I didn't know if you'd be as interested in it as I was,

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.360
but you were, and I appreciate that.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:32.120
I am all about this stuff, right?

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.240
So we've talked about it on the,

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.640
like the Kanban method that I've kind of modified, right?

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.120
It's all about teamwork,

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.830
and teamwork takes people,

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.390
and you need those people to be engaged.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.270
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:51.390
And this is, that is what I want to do.

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:53.390
I want people, and this is getting harder

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.230
two years into this pandemic thing, but yeah, all on board.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:57.830
All right, man, I gotta run, I gotta go,

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.550
but this has been a fun Friday.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:03.190
Thanks for being part of episode,

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:04.830
let me look at my recorder here.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:05.670
158.

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:08.350
158 of the A.B. testing podcast,

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:10.470
which was way better than 157.

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:12.990
And then if you wanna go back, listen to 57,

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:15.030
you're welcome to, but don't.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.590
Anyway, I am Alan.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:18.430
I'm Brent.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:19.550
We'll see you next time.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:20.390
Bye.

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:21.940
Wack-a-no-n-
