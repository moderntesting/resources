00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.660
A.B.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:33.160
Test

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160
New Year!

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
Welcome, welcome.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.880
Good to have you here on the A.B.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.880
Testing Podcast.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.880
I'm...

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.880
All three of you.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.200
Yes, thank you all three of you for listening yet again and joining us in 2019.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.120
And I made this rant one year ago, almost exactly, in 2018.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.480
The proper way to pronounce the year we're in is 2019, not 2019.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.000
If you disagree, you can just stop talking to me.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.120
If you feel like it's something you're going to repeat every year...

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.080
I wasn't born in 1965.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.540
I was born in 1965.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.540
Just saying.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.940
Yeah, if you're going to do this every year, perhaps you need to be a bit more assertive

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.710
or tell them what, you know, something a bit stronger.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.560
Like it's 2019, right?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.240
Yeah, I don't know why I would need to be assertive.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.120
I was like, do I need to be assertive saying that two plus two is four?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.400
No, people should just know that.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.840
Well, you know, the other thing too, I don't think our listeners would pronounce it incorrectly.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.200
I don't think they really care about this conversation.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
So let's move on.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Okay.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.920
Anyway, happy new year, Alan.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.920
Yeah, you too, Brad.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.080
Did you enjoy your break?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080
I did.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.080
I did nothing but play Xbox and watch Netflix pretty much.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.520
I did some house cleaning.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.920
It was fun.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.520
I did not get away from the screen, but I watched a lot of Binging.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.680
I watched Bandersnatch.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.520
I watched Birdcage.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.520
Birdbox.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.520
Birdbox.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520
Birdcage.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520
Awesome movie.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.720
Totally different plot.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.680
I watched the Birdbox.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680
It was good.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.480
It caught up on my Luke Cage, got into my Daredevil.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.800
I'm kind of behind on the whole Marvel, Netflix thing because so many come out.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800
And I don't have that much time.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.120
Yeah, you get a lot of time.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120
Yeah.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.120
And so I didn't get as far as I wanted.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120
Excellent.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.280
I can get caught up without worrying about when is the next Jessica Jones coming out,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.280
which is my favorite.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.280
Is it?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280
Yeah.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.240
I liked Iron Fist, but I have a martial arts background.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240
Yeah.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.760
And that's probably the most.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.560
The Iron Fist ended it so freaking weird.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.680
I haven't watched that one yet.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.360
I was a big fan of the comic book.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.360
Yeah.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
Both.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.800
I have many issues at home of Luke Cage, the comic, which turned into Power Man, the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
comic.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.960
I also have the whole Iron Fist series, only 15 comics.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.160
And then I think John Byrne, who did X-Men, drew all those and tell the stories.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.560
But I also have the Power Man and Iron Fist series.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:14.090
I have a comic book collection at home that is probably worth today around $30,000.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.290
And so let's excuse us for the tangent.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.090
So Marvel's DC?

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.650
Mostly Marvel.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.690
I was a big Marvel thing.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.130
I should give you my stash link.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.200
Okay.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200
I don't know what that is.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.040
It's a website where I have all my comic books cataloged.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.220
Yeah, you should.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.060
I would love to.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.420
So I was almost all Marvel.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.220
I haven't cataloged.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.100
So I used to catalog them in Excel.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.900
And then I would download the, what is that, one catalog book.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.190
It's a huge, the Over...

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.030
Overstreet comic book guide.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.990
I used to keep little index cards of all my comics.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.910
So I had condition and writer and artist, et cetera.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.910
So what was your jam?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.670
What was your go-to comic, your favorite?

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.670
Oh, Thor.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.670
Oh, really?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.670
Yeah.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.670
Thor.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.670
That's interesting.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.670
I was total X-Men.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.670
I had pretty much everything from, for a while, I sold some of the more expensive ones in

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.870
college to make some money, but from the, what do they call them?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.870
The new X-Men.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.870
But from 1994 on?

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.870
The new ones.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.870
No, no, no.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.870
Those came much, much later.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.200
So that was more mid-70s to early 80s collecting.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.400
I didn't stop collecting.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.000
Actually, you know when I stopped?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.280
When I moved to Microsoft.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280
I stopped in college.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.280
I was out of money and actually sold some comics in college to make money.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.240
So I did, I didn't stop comics, but what I ended up doing, I made a lot of money off

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.440
of magic cards during that same time period.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.440
Oh, interesting.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.440
Interesting.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.440
I never got into that.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.600
I think the writing on some of those X-Men series was so good.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.190
I had a girlfriend in high school who was way into soap operas.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.190
Oh.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.190
And which, like, whatever.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.190
Oh, soap operas.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.190
It was high school.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.830
But I remember giving her my X-Men, like, check these out, and she got totally hooked

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.870
reading through those stories because they're so well written and so well, you know, cliffhangers,

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.870
every issue.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.150
Do you know, do you remember the name Walt Simonson?

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.150
No.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:28.820
So he was the writer of the Thor books back in the day.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.360
And the stories he wrote are a big part of what's in the MCU right now.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360
Oh, interesting.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.360
Very, very interesting.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360
Yeah.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.280
And of course, X-Men, those who don't pay close attention to the Marvel universe, X-Men

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.000
actually live in a different universe than the more mainstream.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
In the MCU.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And do you know why?

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.250
Actually, I don't know why.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.690
Because Sony owns the rights to X-Men and they can't.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.130
That is why Scarlet Witch got her powers from the Infinity Stone and not actually being

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.130
a mutant.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.740
Yeah.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.740
Yeah.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.740
Okay.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.900
Well, you got to do what you got to do.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.900
Indeed.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.900
Speaking of cliffhangers, do you want to...

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.900
Oh.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.900
It's episode 96.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.660
Yeah, this is episode 96.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.460
So you just hung out for the break.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.460
Yeah.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.970
I ended up spending a week in Carlsbad, California.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.850
I saw it with the Disneyland, which is not in Carlsbad.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.410
No, it's in LA, Anaheim.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.410
Right.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.050
So I grew up in LA and man, is Disneyland different.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.210
No.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.740
Disneyland itself isn't, but the parking structure wasn't there.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.180
I've never parked there.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.860
I've always just gone for a conference or flown down a stain at the hotel and then

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.380
walked over to the park.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.140
The Downtown Disney thing seems to have changed quite a bit from...

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.820
That didn't exist when I was there.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.820
Yeah.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.980
And the California thing didn't exist.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.220
The crowd was crazy.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.220
Yeah.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.260
I definitely, now, I've been to both, but at this point in time, I definitely prefer

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.340
Walt Disney World.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.540
If nothing else, because it spreads the crowd out through like 18 different parks.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.540
Yeah.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.180
I went to Disneyland Japan once and that was...

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.820
You think the lines in California were long.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.900
It was every single, every attraction was two hours.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.900
Yeah.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.380
We didn't have that problem.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.580
There's a great app that we took advantage of.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:40.880
We very quickly, me and my son, who were more efficiency minded, worked together and

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.970
worked out like timing and minimizing wait times.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.970
Very lovely.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.850
My agile training got involved in...

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.850
Very well done.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.850
Walking through.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.850
Very well done.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.850
And then there's an update that I have.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:09.690
So as the three know, I've only had one class left and just before New Year, I finally

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.280
went and tried to go sign up for the class.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.760
And I couldn't.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.000
The website said, not a student.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.790
The web, a bunch of other signs on that.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.190
And I'm like, holy crap.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.470
And then I went and looked up requirements on the degree.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.350
It's in the University catalog.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.270
And it said, you have to pass these things and you have six years to do it.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.270
It's one thing that's nice about my school.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.070
For a master's degree, you have six years.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.070
It's online.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.950
You can really take it easy.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.310
And then if you work at something like Microsoft, with six years, you can really spread out

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:58.910
the classes and take advantage of the education benefit here, where they'll pay for school,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.960
but they'll only do a max of 10K a year.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.040
Anyway, I, as several people know, I was iffy.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.120
I'm like, God, I don't want to do this.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.120
But it's one thing.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.900
And going back and forth.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:19.540
Well, once I discovered that the choice had been taken from me, I was actually surprisingly

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.700
depressed.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.960
I'm like, oh, okay.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.720
What do I do on my resume?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.640
What do I do if people want to...

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.240
Just lie like everyone else.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240
Yeah.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.800
Well, you weren't there at the time.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.640
So the couple of days later, I sent mail to the registrar playing dumb saying, hey,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.720
I can't register.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.490
What's going on?

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.560
And they came back and they said, oh, yeah.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.640
I just put a block on you because you took the last year off.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.960
I'll re-enable it and you'll be able to go and register.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:10:01.640
And then I realized even though 2019 minus 2013 is six, I still have all of 2019 to complete

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640
my sixth year.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.400
And I'm like, so a little bit of relief.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400
Signed up.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.140
Class already started.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.450
I still am not happy that I have to do this.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.450
But you don't have to.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.450
I don't have to.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.450
You don't have to do anything.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.450
No.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.620
So now I realize that if I don't...

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.540
I will regret it if I don't complete it.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.020
So that little thing actually closed the decision making process for me.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.020
Cool.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.020
Anyway.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.460
You can join me in having a master's degree.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.460
That'd be nice.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:40.010
Of course, my master's is useless, but well, I learned how to learn.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.410
I don't think your master's is useless.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.770
All the research part, I still apply every day.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:53.400
And the other thing I'm excited about, because I've known this for two years now, is that

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.360
is once I am done, I already know what I'm going to go do next.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.040
And it's relevant because I'm going to start taking guitar lessons.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.580
All right.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.580
Cool.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.900
Do you want to do a podcast?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.900
Sure.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.900
Let's do a podcast.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.260
All right.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:19.380
If you haven't listened to episode 95, our year in review, which by the way...

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.140
You didn't do it like Voiceover guy.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.740
Last time on...

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.820
Last time on AUB testing.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:33.720
One, our episode was mentioned in the latest weekly update from Ministry of Test.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720
That episode was?

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720
Why?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.200
Because it's cool to listen to.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.720
Oh, the podcast, sure.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.720
But why that episode?

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.040
Because people like reflections predictions.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.240
So then they can come make fun of us when we're wrong.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.600
But as we were leaving the room, as I was heading on my vacation, you were returning to yours.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.640
You said something interesting.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.800
I did.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:05.780
I believe I have discovered a missing principle from MT.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.900
You have, have you?

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.580
I believe I do.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.060
Is it the Peter Principle?

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.060
No.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:18.260
Since that one is well established, doesn't need to be part of MT.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:25.240
Although actually, in a twisted way, yes, it is the Peter Principle.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.080
Tell me your hypothesis.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.250
And for those of you following, we don't add principles willy nilly.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.450
We don't even edit them willy nilly.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:41.530
We vet them significantly among our three listeners who all hang out with us on one

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.930
of the three.slack.com.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.810
Of course, you can go to moderntesting.org and click the link to join that Slack group.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.810
Free to join.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.810
But.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.810
And it's the only place to get the cool sticker.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:56.610
I don't know what you're going to say, but let's talk about this proposed principle

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.820
number eight, which I already feel strongly against.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.300
And we will discuss it.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.890
And you feel strongly against just because seven's a cooler number than eight?

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.430
Because I feel like the principle.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.870
More and more, I feel like the principles are complete.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.060
Okay.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.380
Let me sum the current principles.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.670
Number one, I'm not going to read this whole thing.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:31.470
It's around guiding people towards the key focus, which is the business.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:38.630
Number two, it's about being in a team accelerant and it speaks to sort of an execution model

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:44.740
and the types of differences we use to execute.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.940
Number three, a force of continuous improvement.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:53.970
If you were to sum up, this is about adaptability, not prescriptability.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.880
We're helping the team learn.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.040
Sure.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.420
Well, then I would say number four is about the quality culture.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:09.840
And I think that's a big part of helping the team learn, but it's a team focus.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.920
You help the team grow.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.300
Number five, it's about the customer.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:24.570
And in my view, it is about the true definition of the word quality.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.670
Number six, data.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:33.750
Data is great, but in another aspect, it's about an execution model.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.860
It's about a how.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.130
And then finally, we expand the testability and know how.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:50.010
This is about testing scale and in my view, removing testing specialists from being a linchpin

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.330
in the system.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.330
Sure.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.200
Okay.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:01.560
One of the things that we've talked about over and over again is followers of MT need

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.760
to be accustomed to taking a leadership role.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.200
I think the fatal flaw right now is in the MT principles.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:20.220
If you go through and you do this and you do this too soon, what happens to you?

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:27.220
And I think one of the aspects that is missing from MT is that, and I wanted to talk about

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.220
it today.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.060
I wanted to propose it and see if you agreed and then maybe brainstorm around the language.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:40.280
But I think the issue that we are missing is, you know this whole phrase, you can't love

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.760
anybody else if you don't love yourself?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760
No.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.760
Okay.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.760
It's a phrase it's old.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.840
I think it's similar to leadership.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:57.800
One of the first things around learning leadership is leading by example.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:05.160
I do think one of the things that you have that is missing from MT is some sort of principle

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:14.720
that specifies you need to guide yourself, you need to control your own destiny as a result

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:21.350
or as part of this as you go through and migrate people to an MT philosophy.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.190
Thoughts?

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.500
I will say it is on the slide channel, why you're thinking.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:35.460
One of the most common questions that we have is, well, what happens to me or where do we

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.620
go or how do we do it?

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.460
They're very tactical things.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.060
So that point is true.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:49.820
A lot of questions we get are what happens after I transition my team to modern testing?

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:58.350
If I'm going through that myself, continually shrinking my team, what do I do next?

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.110
So that part I fully agree with.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.990
That part we need to discuss because the answer to that is a bunch of different things.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:10.990
And then getting into your point, yes, it's important that we think about how do we,

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.510
what does our transition role look like?

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:19.990
But the difficult part is for that question is that it is unique for, it's going to

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.670
be unique for every single person.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.390
There isn't a blueprint like the person that transitions teams to modern testing.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.310
This is the role they typically do, that it looks like X.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.220
That's stuck in a habit.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:41.560
I actually like that modern testing principles are about how they're really an extension,

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.080
as I called it before, of Agile testing.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:51.280
But they're about the team, how the team becomes a top class software engineering team.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:57.200
What things do they have to do to make quality software that combat all the things that

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.280
are wrong with traditional test blast, test as the bottleneck, test as the scapegoat, testing

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.280
approaches?

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.920
I completely agree.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920
I like that.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.840
So it's tough for me.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.000
But let me add one counterpoint.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.760
Okay, then I'll go on.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:21.380
If we have software teams today, it's going to be about leadership.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:31.430
We talk about transitioning of activities, as well as supporting or investing in several

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.350
execution activities.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:42.820
The one thing that has occurred in both your and my careers in the past is as we work towards

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:50.430
elimination of things that are stupid, we've both discovered that we get acknowledged and

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.740
moved into a different role.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:19:01.900
However, I don't know that it's entirely accidental or luck driven.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:08.700
Both you and I, for example, as I moved out of test, I went to dev.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.020
How did I get to dev?

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:18.770
Well I invested myself because at minimum I needed to pass the stupid interview.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:30.110
The leader in the empty space that we're targeting here needs to have a sense of where they're

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.270
going and needs to invest in themselves as well.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.910
I think while you were talking, I got why it doesn't click with me.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.540
And maybe this is where some feedback would help.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.660
The modern testing principles, again, I call the antidote to traditional software testing.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.860
That's how we make software in a much better, more efficient way that's going to be better

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.140
for our customers and better for our business and more efficient overall.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.580
They're team based.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:06.670
I think where the glitch comes in is we've talked about this before, but very early

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.110
on in our discussions about modern testing, we said there's no such thing as a modern

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.150
tester.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:20.670
But we've also acknowledged that someone who's leading the team towards modern testing principles

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.740
could be referred to as a modern tester.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:30.660
But I still, and that's I guess sort of the role I'm in, I'm not a new name for that.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:37.820
If the person that led the team towards modern testing principles was called the Poobah,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.820
I'm in the role of a Poobah.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.100
We have language for it.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.620
We call it the coach.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.820
Okay, so I'm the coach.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.530
These aren't coaching principles.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.770
They're about the team.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:55.630
So it just so happens that I'm in individual role, but the principles, having a principle

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:01.290
around an individual role takes away from the modern testing principles which are about

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.890
team achievements and team capabilities.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.350
I hear what you're saying.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:14.700
So I'm still not thinking it's a principle, but given the amount of questions that

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.420
given what I'm going through myself, given the discussion we've had on the Slack channel

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.340
about this, given how open ended is, oh my God, what happens?

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:28.100
And also adding into that the fact that just like when Microsoft or Yahoo or whoever just

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.300
got rid of their testers thinking getting rid of the safety net entirely was all you

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:38.340
needed to do, there is a probably legitimate worry as more and more teams become aware

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.740
of what modern testing is going.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.020
Okay, let's do that.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.860
Let's skip to the last half of principle number seven that'll accelerate it.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.300
It accelerates in the mission statement.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.740
We'll make all that happen.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.280
I think there is some sort of a den.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.040
I'm not sure what the proper name for this is.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.600
Let's not get semantic yet, but there's a lot of principle.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:03.880
There is a supporting paragraph or a supporting manifest, a supporting something.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.800
I don't know if it's a principle or not.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:13.480
That supports the leadership and the individual role and what happens when someone

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.310
gets caught.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.910
But I have just realized, so this is fantastic.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.030
This is kind of what I was hoping it would happen.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:31.620
So principles, let's ignore the semantics.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.860
If it's important enough, you and I will agree it's a principle.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.780
I'm not going to try to fight that.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.420
I think there's agreement that it's an important topic.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.140
Principle number five.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.820
We can have this discussion to vet it out, but only the customer, our listeners, people

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.980
who only our listeners can help us figure out what is right here.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.460
We'll just have the debate to get the ideas out there.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.140
Okay, go on.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:02.860
One of the things, and what you just said triggered a thought, and it's a thought that

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:08.220
I've seen over and over again in the teams who I trained through Agile.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:15.340
I now have gotten very good at de-specializing teams.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:24.680
But once there's momentum in that direction, you need to stop them before they overgeneralize.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:31.600
So you can think of it as a pendulum between specialists and generalists, and you de-specialize

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:38.040
and they are becoming nice, TC people, but then they don't stop.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.520
Until they're flat as a pancake.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.240
And the risk with overgeneralized people is that they're all the same.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:50.120
So the problem with having a team is teams are made up of individuals.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.750
You can't treat them.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:59.150
There is an investment that needs to be done within a team at an individual level because

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.630
they are part of the team.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.710
In a soccer team, you don't train everyone to be a keeper.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.510
You don't train everyone to be a forward.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:14.800
You do want some versatility, but the people who are talented at keeping and forwarding

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:24.100
– yeah, I know all the soccer's – you want to invest in that specialization while

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.100
still maintaining that generalization.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:38.170
And I think language that is highlighted around that is important and missing.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.620
Your turn.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.140
Now I've got to think about that because now it's clicking a little bit better.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.740
I don't know.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.300
I've got to think about that for a minute because it doesn't have the same sort of trigger

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.540
as the – let's have a principle about the individual.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.940
Agile's different than MT.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.060
MT fits within agile very well, like a foot in a sock.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.300
There's probably a better metaphor there.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:12.970
Is there anything in modern – anything in the principles now that would lead a team towards

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.940
overgeneralization?

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.980
I think.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.580
I don't think so.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.060
Convince me I'm wrong.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.220
Boy, we could –

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.380
So here's the thing I'm saying is that there's nothing that prevents it.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.700
I don't think it's anything that encourages it either.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.740
No, it's – so what I will tell you is, at least from my experience, like a lot

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:40.780
of the principles we have here, as you well know, come from Lean and –

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.300
And DevOps.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.310
And DevOps and other things like that.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:57.090
But this is – much of what is discussed here is we're telling people to battle against

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.930
external forces.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.610
And I think it's entirely possible.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.290
Let's take your situation as an example.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:09.690
I think you're leading all of this just fine.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:18.480
But once you have created a stable quality culture, once you have converted people into

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.880
understanding the customer and not the PM is the only one that matters, once you've

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:32.300
convinced people that the team is stronger by spreading out the testing abilities – right?

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.460
Let's take that aspect.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:41.220
So for a lot of teams – and I'm certain this happens within Unity, but I don't know.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.860
I don't work there.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.980
Several people are going to view you as, in fact, the test guy, regardless of what decoration,

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.220
what title, and how you frame it.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.820
You're going to be the test guy to at least one person –

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.820
Probably more true for the people on my team than for me.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.820
Right.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:07.980
When you succeed in publicly spreading out your secret ingredient, your special ingredient,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:15.130
the reason why they hired you, and you've convinced them that, yeah, in fact, we don't

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:21.710
need Alan's team, if you haven't invested in some fashion of where you're going to

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.850
go next, that puts you at risk.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.650
I think that lives outside the – I don't feel at risk.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.930
The absolute worst thing that happens –

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.370
Well, yeah, but is that just because you're chock full of self-confidence?

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:40.700
No, I don't have nearly enough self-confidence, but I do have enough – I mean, the absolute

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:46.340
worst case thing that could happen is they say, thanks for fixing all this stuff, Alan.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.340
We don't need you anymore.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.860
Then I go find another job.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.780
That's the worst case, but that's not going to happen.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.700
So yes, you need to think about probably earlier than you think about what you do

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.460
next and how your role evolves.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.860
It's really not a next.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.860
It's not a step.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.620
It's an evolution.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.620
Yes.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.260
As you are helping the team adapt, you yourself need to adapt.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.260
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.260
That's –

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.260
And I get that, but I think –

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.660
And you can't ignore it.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.820
That's the message I'm trying to say.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.780
This is something we'll continue to discuss.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.820
I'm not bought in yet.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:25.970
I think the individual growth comes outside of modern testing.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:31.850
But while you were talking about overgeneralization, I wanted to walk through the principles real

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.170
quick and ask you this.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.170
I'm curious what would happen.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.330
It's like, can you overdo any of these principles?

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.170
For example, walk through with me.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.690
Listen, don't read.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.170
Could we improve the business?

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.250
Could we over-prioritize improving the business?

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.210
I guess, yeah, if you put it that way, maybe.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:50.820
Yeah, for sure.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.960
You couldn't improve it too much, but you could over-prioritize it.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.390
Could you accelerate the team too much?

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.190
I guess you could focus too much on it.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.990
Now that I'm reading through it, you could overemphasize it.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.950
The way you're going to go is very much my complaint about the Agile Manifesto, right?

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:13.390
People, the part of the thing about the principles is they're intended to balance each other

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:20.280
out to make sure that you don't overemphasize one thing in contrast to another.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.280
So I'm going to say if there were to be –

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.280
It's a system.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.640
I was going to say if there were to be an eighth principle, that it would be that these

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.680
principles are a system.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.680
They work together.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.760
Actually, this is maybe going somewhere.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.480
I'll get the right phrasing here, but leaving one out or overemphasizing on one is not

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.480
modern testing.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.990
It's a balance.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.310
It's a balanced system.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.950
You can't just go, yeah, these are great, but we're not going to do the data thing

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.680
because we think they're stupid.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.240
It's not empty.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.840
Or these are great, but it's somebody else's problem to improve the business.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.840
We're not going to focus on that.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840
That's not our thing.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.280
This is a challenging topic.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.240
When I coach people through, particularly if I'm going to coach people through Kanban,

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.720
if they're in waterfall and I skip straight to Kanban, it's foreign to them.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.720
Oh, no shit.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.720
I mean, yes.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:15.740
And the biggest problem – and here I will say a problem in this context – with a shift

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:26.180
to Agile, let's say, again, like Kanban here, is it's principle driven.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.860
It doesn't tell you what to do, per se.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.720
It tells you how to decide.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:40.140
I like Mary Poppendyke's principles that she uses.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:46.740
For example, the one I'm thinking of right now is optimize the whole, which says you're

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:54.600
going to have some business KPI, optimize the business KPI, don't decompose it into

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.520
its component parts and try to sub-optimize those.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:04.040
From a data science point of view, I know that to be true because you end up having

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:13.050
one KPI, one of these component KPIs cannibalizing the other and having no effect on the whole.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:20.320
But I did the analysis and I said, okay, I think she has seven principles in her list.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.160
And I said, what happens if I do – I did this for each of them.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.640
What happens if I do all the others but not that one?

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:33.760
And every single time, I was able to go, oh, this dysfunction would creep out.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.640
I see the same thing with ours.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.480
Not to break my arm, patting ourselves on the back, but I think they're a system.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.040
So I'd be curious to look at hers.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.360
Did she talk about them being a system and working together?

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.000
Or does that just come out of the fact?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
I don't recall.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.640
Because maybe I've taken that for granted.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.590
But no, I think it's – or maybe it's in some text that goes around them.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.590
I don't know.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:02.270
But when I guide people through it, I said – so my process is I guide them through.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:09.350
I spend three months being their scrum master of sorts.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:15.030
I run their standup and – to help reinforce what I taught them, because it's too much

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:20.750
all at once until they can sort of get it and they can hand off to an internal coach.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:25.270
But one of the things that I tell them is when you start this, you – I will tell

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.070
you a set of rules and you will follow those rules.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:37.240
It is an advanced topic to – and as you know from your cities with Kanban, you are

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:44.720
permitted and encouraged to modify the rules as long as you have a rationale.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.100
But what I've discovered is when people start doing that and they don't understand why

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:57.920
the rule was there in the first place, they always, literally 100% of the time, hurt themselves.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.450
All right.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.530
So I haven't sold you on –

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.530
No, you haven't.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.290
But I do think – you sold me on the idea.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.580
Even with all the questions about what happens when I get my team towards modern testing.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.220
I mentioned earlier, the worst thing is they – is Unity says, well, thanks.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.220
You did everything.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.220
Nothing left for you to do.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.220
Get out of here.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:21.620
But that's not the case, because although we're moving towards modern testing, we have

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.380
a ways to go.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.660
More on some teams, much less on others.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.580
It's certainly not self-sustaining in many places.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.740
So there's a lot more to do.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:40.080
But I think optimizing the whole is a good way to put that.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:47.660
I think making sure that we are accelerating the achievement of shipable quality across

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:55.740
all teams is still a goal, still a mission, and there's still work to do there.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.260
Let me tell you my motivation.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.220
And you know this already.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:06.900
MT in my mind is an amalgam of our experience towards something that you and I had a lot

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.020
of passion around when Microsoft went through this.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:24.670
And that is helping to remove the FUD from the test organization when this was announced

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:32.550
and helping them guide – or helping to guide them towards a place where they would

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.190
add value.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:39.030
And I will say first, certainly in the orgs that I was in, I was in the minority of seeing

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.390
the clear path here.

00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:44.910
I was talking with tests and they were like, oh my God, I'm going to lose my job.

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:47.750
I'm like, yeah, with that attitude, you will.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:53.690
Whether you're right or wrong, what you believe will happen will happen.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:35:01.530
But open them their eyes that, no, they are not – they are at a fork in a road, not

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:07.330
on a path that guarantees a leap off the edge of the cliff.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.660
When you're scared, when you're frightened, you don't see that other path.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:17.500
What I worry that in this particular case, right, we have the three listeners.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:22.550
Oh, by the way, for the three, FUD is fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.210
Yeah, the scary future.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:31.650
I don't think you and I scaled to be able to be there and intercept each individual

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:38.560
as when they're not able to see that positive path forward.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.980
And maybe that's it.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:48.920
Maybe it's – maybe what I'm seeing is perhaps just a slight language change to Principle

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.920
7.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.830
Let's – if you don't want to join the Slack group, that's cool.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.790
You can email us, allanatangryweasel.com.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.630
And if you have feedback on that or thoughts, you can just let us know.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:07.470
But I have a feeling some more discussion after feedback will come up on this in Episode

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.470
97.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.870
I have a hunch.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:10.870
Yeah.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:16.950
And one of the things I'm actually excited about as well, and it's on the Slack channel,

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:22.620
if you have an interest in it, you'll need to join the Slack channel, mostly because I'm

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.040
lazy and I don't want to look it up.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:36.570
Danny Fought is about to do a presentation on his experience leaving test.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:47.000
And I think those type of things are going to be helpful towards the MT believer follower,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:54.020
whatever we call them, to make sure that as they're doing the right thing for the quality

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.660
culture, they're also doing the right thing for themselves.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:05.580
Because I didn't get into this to create a new way for these folks who I believe add

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.900
great value.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.900
I didn't get into this to find a new way for them to lose their jobs.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:16.270
I got into this to find a new way for them to still add value.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:21.110
I'm not, as I mentioned last time, I'm not planning on doing any conferences, especially

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.750
not test conferences in 2019.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:27.910
But while you were talking, I had an idea for a talk I want to do, but it'll have to

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.670
I'll just plant the seed someone else can give it.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.670
I'll help you with it.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:34.510
But it's a life after test talk, which is, which is good.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.550
Danny's stories is his individual story.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.630
I think sharing four or five or six different paths, because I know at least that many

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.630
off the top of my head.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:42.750
I don't think it should be a talk.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.890
I think we should do it on the podcast.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:50.860
I think we should invite people in and interview them and do that.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.100
You know, one of my predictions for I don't know if I talked about it last time, one of

00:37:54.100 --> 00:38:00.340
our predictions for 2019 was that we would have an external guest, a dial in guest.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.180
And we could still do that.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:08.810
I have the hardware to do that to get a good recording, which I haven't tested yet.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.090
And I'd also have to the only way I know how to do is Skype.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:14.490
But I have to install Skype, which is a little bit which I hate, but I guess it could

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.490
happen.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.930
Something we could do, we should have.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:23.210
We really need to have some guests to talk about the transitions this year off to

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:24.650
figure out how to do that.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:30.170
I had a as an aside, usually we keep the recording equipment here in.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.930
I'm sorry, I forgot what's the name of your company?

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:33.410
Microsoft.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.170
Microsoft usually keep it here at Brent's office at Microsoft.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.650
But I had it with me over the break.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:44.850
And I should have taken some time when I had it to try out the adding a remote

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:49.820
color hardware to my setup here.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.100
But I didn't.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.860
It's not that much harder to take the gear and instead of walking it to my office,

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.460
walk it to your car.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.540
I know, I know.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.980
I could just take it with me.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:01.900
Right.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.500
You're right.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.580
I could just take it with me today and then go check that out.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.620
Maybe I'll do that.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.380
I don't know if I have time in the next two weeks.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.520
I'm taking off.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.350
We didn't get this in the pre-patter, pre-chatter, pre-chatter-patter.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:19.350
I am leaving to Europe for 10 days in, when do I leave?

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.310
Two weeks?

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.310
Work or?

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.310
Work.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.980
Work.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:30.610
Two days in manager meetings and then travel day to go, a whopping two hour train ride.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.660
Travel day and spending a five day internal conference in Sweden.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.300
Nothing like going to the beach in Sweden in January.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.220
Five day internal conference?

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.250
Yeah.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:45.980
How many people, how many employees does Unity have?

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.980
Total?

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.860
About 2,000, but there'll be about 100 of us there.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.540
So is that more like a ginormous offsite then?

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.540
Kind of.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.100
It's kind of a ginormous offsite, but it's all, it's, remember what we used to do at

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.100
Microsoft?

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.100
Sounds like a Windows all hands.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.020
The engineering days, the, what was that called?

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.020
Hackathon?

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.620
No, it was a call when we had over in the conference center the week of talks and

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.780
workshops.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.660
EE, the org I was in ran the thing.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.660
Yeah.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.460
So the one I pay attention to is called the MLDC.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.380
No, it was way before then.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.580
There was like for three or four or five years straight.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.900
Machine learning and data conference.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:22.900
Yeah.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.900
So yeah, we call it a conference.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.300
Anyway, it's that sort of thing.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.460
So about a hundred of the people in quality roles across and some other roles across

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:38.060
Unity doing talks, workshops, lightning talks, hanging out, getting learning from each

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.060
other.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.460
You know, I'm a big believer in community.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.700
So this is something I'm really excited about.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.560
So it's a Barney event.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560
What's a Barney event?

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.240
It's sharing is caring.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.560
Oh my God.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.180
Yeah, that's right.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.480
We would love to hear what you think about the discussion today.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.850
I definitely am leaving with a lot to think about.

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:58.910
I'll post the question up on the Slack channel.

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.150
It's technically a Slack team, right?

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.150
I don't know.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.150
There's channels within the team.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.630
Yeah, the Slack thing.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.300
I don't.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.660
Yeah, that thing.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:15.060
I was on LinkedIn the other day and saw a posting for someone from my old team at

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.820
Microsoft Teams posted.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.020
And it was interesting because it was largely like, oh, I was like taken from a job

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.620
break that I wrote.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.140
I recognize this job break.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.860
I recognize these words.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.860
Yeah.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.860
Teams.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.460
Teams is the thing now.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:36.950
Teams has almost successfully gotten rid of everything in Skype within Microsoft.

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:41.990
And as I get more and more accustomed to it, I'm hating it less and less.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:46.110
And to be fair, it's a good product, but you would never, it's.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:53.020
There are things that I, that I, there's little bells and whistles that I think the

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.660
wrong decision was made.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:03.460
But I also, so I want to invite any new listeners to join the Slack team.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.460
There you go.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.620
I think that is right.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.290
Yep.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:14.450
I think we have enough queued up in the mailbag to do a mailbag next episode.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:15.450
All right.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.090
Let's schedule that in a moment here and we'll figure that out.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:24.810
Or we can, if there's enough interest in the three, we can keep going on principally.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:25.810
Yeah.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:26.810
We'll just wing it.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:31.170
But for now we've babbled long enough and probably nobody is left listening.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.410
They've all hit end.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.410
We'll see you next time.

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:35.570
I'm Alan.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:36.570
I'm Brent.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:36.770
Bye.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:05.260
I discovered a way.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:09.110
Yes.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.110
And it will be.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.710
I am so going to keep this part on the podcast.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:14.710
What the.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:15.710
I started recording already.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:31.040
It's still going to fall down.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.730
I think I have to do righty tighty lefty loosey.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:37.730
Ha!

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.730
Inanimate object.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:44.440
At least for this podcast, I've defeated you.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.260
And one of these is shut the fuck up.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.820
I wonder, I'll make that the inner groove.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.820
What?

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.820
Where the inner groove is?

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.820
No.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:59.740
The inner groove is like sometimes you buy an album back when you buy a record album.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.140
A vinyl disc.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.300
Oh god.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:07.500
And sometimes they put a little bit of like audio in the inner groove, which is that groove

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:12.100
that when you get to the end of the record, whether it's a 45 or an LP, you get to the

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.500
end that little space in there.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.980
Sometimes they put a little, and the needle would go, it would just kind of go round

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.860
and round there until you lifted it off.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.140
Sometimes they put a little bit of fun audio or music or a spoken voice in there.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.350
It's called the inner groove.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:27.900
Okay.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.900
Wow.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.470
You're old.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.500
I am fucking old.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.420
You know, growing up, I never did a lot of vinyl.
