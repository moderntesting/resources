Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.310
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:22.460
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey we're back yeah

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.290
mostly anything else that comes to mind yeah and today's gonna be extra bad

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.810
extra bad extra yeah those of you that aren't in the I don't even know where to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.730
start those of you that aren't in one of the three dot slack comm you can get an

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.970
invitation by going to modern testing org if you are there you will have seen my

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.530
post from a few weeks ago where I said Brent and I recorded no Brent and I met

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.570
and talked about what could have been perhaps the best podcast ever done by

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.590
anyone of all time and I didn't record I absolutely believe it was yeah it was I

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:15.160
mean so now now everyone welcome to episode 2-0 redo 202.2 could I do that so

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.080
yeah if you could imagine imagine like you've just listened to the most amazing

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.400
podcast episode in the world ever and then double it and then double it again

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.760
and that's what we had all or so we thought or yeah I mean you never know I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.760
mean we'll never know and that's the whole thing yeah it's it's great big

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.080
bucket in the sky all right we have a male we when you brought up when you

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.680
brought up how to actually solve world hunger overnight I mean that was amazing

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.200
I know and I can't quite recreate it so one thing we did I wanted to re-mention

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.580
from the last so we're not gonna rehash it I did write about it on

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.520
anger weasel that sub stack comm I think but one thing I wanted to mention is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.250
oh because I guess it's worth worth calling out in a podcast because didn't

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.290
get published last time after 200 and I also did it in 201 rather than take and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.610
do a full edit of getting through all of our good blas and Brent's coughing and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.930
this and that I decided I'm gonna try for a while to do far less editing and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.140
just fix fix the levels add a little bit of EQ try and make a sound good and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.020
then go from there and see how it goes and listeners let us know what you think

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.180
you can you have many ways to do that the easiest is John our slack group go

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.540
to modern testing org blah blah blah and we're gonna see how that works and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.900
then I spend a lot of time taking the ums out and after 10 years and 200

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.860
episodes maybe we can just stop saying that as much I don't know just a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.380
thought I died it's I'm old and in my habits I don't know if I can stop I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.180
put filler words in and today's worse and I'll tell you why in a minute but

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.100
what do you think about that brain ready to go your cats here today the cat is

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.420
dead Brent's cat is next to him in a little bed on the desk it's great but

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.510
unfortunately the cat died I am NOT going to prove that she is not dead

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.590
because if I do that or mention her name she will immediately start fine

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.950
I can only and what I am seeing for listeners who don't not have video which

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:52.700
is all of you what I am seeing is a cat that appears to be dead I'm still not I

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.620
could either confirm or deny yeah she's been doing it all day I saw the cat move

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.860
I saw the cat move the cat is no longer dead Schrodinger's cat is alive so hey

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.680
man bread what's new what's going on oh my god oh what I did is it review season

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.710
again what happened oh review season was was what's what's the Oh God this time

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:23.520
you're stuck to the gajillion you're fine oh yeah if I could ever you know the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.880
problem with the stock being at a gajillion is you have to you know have

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.400
time to go do something with it yeah so though it's review season and I'll just

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:51.210
say in terms of this is the first time since Satya has taken over that I got an

00:04:51.210 --> 00:05:00.460
uncomfortable whiff of the bomber years and I'm like oh no those were the those

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.460
and the aftermath of those were the death of me like I tell myself all the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.540
time look at the stock I go fast eat at Microsoft I'd be so much better off and

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.610
I think oh yeah but I'd also be dead so it's hard so that's that's rough man who

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.850
who did it and you want me to take him out so the latter part yes okay first

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:30.720
first I don't know yet I'll make a phone call I got a guy the but it just to

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.700
give you a hint like like the last two weeks on average been doing four to five

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.420
hours of sleep because there's there's a there's a couple other things happening

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:48.120
that have to happen at the same time as well and so thankfully the the the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.080
review season part of it is is over for now we got a three-day weekend and if my

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:03.000
body clock lets me I am going to sleep all three FM days okay I will tell you a

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.620
couple things I was gonna count them I couldn't I can't count past one one is I

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.360
as I get older I have less and less tolerance for people who are jerks and

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.130
people who I would say are people who act stupid your behavior comes from

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.730
motivation when you act stupid because you're you're there's something about

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.940
being a jerk in there but I I it there was a time of my life where I could

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.540
let it roll off and for whatever I'm old get off my lawn whatever I just

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:44.890
cannot handle when someone is a jerk with the exception of if someone has the

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.330
jerk and they have some self-awareness about it but if they're just if that's

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.180
who they that's who they think they need to be then fuck them the other thing is

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.280
I was in New York the last as you know last couple weeks and I had a flight

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.620
back last night supposed to get back and settle around 9 delay delay delay landed

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.920
around 1 o'clock in the morning came home got four or five hours of sleep my

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:20.230
body said get up Alan it's 10 a.m. on the East Coast so yeah lots of coffee

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.990
lots of snarkiness throughout the day I have less patience when I'm tired and

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:32.750
here we are and the thing is actually I'm going to careful listeners mark the date

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:40.140
I'm going to say something nice about Brent oh boy shit it's I already feel weird

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.780
never mind I'm not gonna do it no I I think we both can be the grumpy old men

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:52.440
the stark you'll mean we can be pissed off but together we're better that for

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:59.060
sure for sure yes because you know some good can come out of this you know it's

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:06.960
it's the world is a crazy weird place and the and the world of work is full of

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.360
people who do not actually understand how to get work done and you and I are

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.400
gonna try and help people navigate through that hell I just thinking yeah

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:26.910
grumpy old man is up is one of my better skills I mean it's it's up there with like

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:37.910
occupying space all right we we got a thing we can I can kick off a

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:43.790
conversation here if you're ready to get into the podcast proper yep and okay then

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.790
well welcome back it's been a long break we were recovering from the episode the

00:08:49.110 --> 00:09:00.560
escapades of 200 but speaking of which we have a question so that that makes me so

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:08.750
happy it does on one of the things we covered in the long lost episode from

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:14.790
last time that we did not record was Brent noticing my joy in having all of

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.470
my little audio toys to play with as we do the podcast and it's kind of do do

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.270
stuff live every episodes live that's really what we're getting at really with

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.600
me not editing as much everything's live everything's live coming soon to twitch

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.120
you don't know what's happening you know what we could twitch we could we could

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:40.870
the thing is if you look at the two of us we are made for podcasting for better

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:46.950
for worse I mean yeah yeah like at times I think we should both just turn

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:53.670
off our cameras oh yeah yeah but I wouldn't see the dead cat so on our slack

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:59.750
group which I've already what's the word talked about a couple times there's

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.950
another word there but I lost it Sean H has a question in our mailbag channel

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.510
he says finally getting the episode 200 thank you for listening to episode 200

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.790
hopefully you didn't start at one and Alan's calm I don't remember saying

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.550
this here to help my I do know what I want to talk about but and sorry for the

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.630
editorial here but I don't remember exactly what Sean is talking about but

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.230
you may remember but I kind of got the gist of it says an Alan's comment

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:31.870
intrigued me on enterprise change do you think you could discuss in more depth

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.590
your experience on how you managed enterprise level changes without

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.420
people knowing I work at a big enterprise trying to improve quality

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.220
mindsets and feel overwhelmed level of effort and potential will of those

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:58.880
resisting so so we've done that yeah I have no idea what we talked about no me

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.400
neither but I can actually answer the question anyway the fact that the fact

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:10.440
that I have the memory retention of a small ant makes no difference makes no

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.560
difference I can talk about this and I can answer this question and I can answer

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:21.000
the crap out of this question oh well and the thing is like I was about to you

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.650
know say the initial question again do you think you could discuss in more depth

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:34.050
stop stop okay that's it can you think you could discuss in more depth dot dot

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:45.350
dot for Alan the answer is yes and I've seen him do it all right and and on things

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:52.860
he knows nothing about and quite well like he could pass the I don't know what's

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:59.180
the Turing test for intelligence or knowledge I don't know I'm a bot yeah by

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.060
the way the the caps of things are getting worse I hate them so this one's

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.060
interesting timing wise because I just put together a talk kind of about this

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:15.350
and I'm not giving anywhere externally and doing it for a friend for an internal

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.990
audience and I will do it for your company for you know $10,000 whatever you

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:30.350
need I got a pay some bills all right so but the second part is I mean I want to

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.550
put his context in there because absolutely true since I work at a big

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.510
enterprise and feel overwhelmed level of effort potential will of those

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:45.160
resisting is because people are lazy and don't want to change yeah in general I

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.710
mean you know this is the hard part it's organizational change so let me let

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:57.510
me go into depth because this is what I love doing I love trying to change

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.720
people who don't want to change and because they don't want to change for a

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.650
multitude of reasons what are some of those reasons Brent Brent was writing

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:13.680
wasn't making attention you ready why do people resist change the number one

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.000
thing is because it's scary think ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.330
that's the absolute number one reason yeah it is and for and it's scary for

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.890
different reasons they're fearful for different reasons maybe this change took

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:35.610
my job away maybe this change will oh maybe this change will require me to

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.080
learn new skills I'm afraid I won't be able to learn them which roughly is the

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:46.220
equivalent of take my job away potentially it's just deferred maybe I

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:52.520
won't be as important anymore I guess maybe there I'll take my job away or

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.240
there's something a version of a version of that but keep going you're on

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.360
yeah yeah so you can jump in here anytime you want I am extremely

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.760
interruptible on this topic so there's a one of my books favorite books that I've

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.920
mentioned a crap ton of times in general and on the podcast is a book called

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.080
Leadership on the Line by Ronald Heffetz and some other authors whose names I

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.800
forget and in that book he talks about the difference between adaptive versus

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:27.450
technical challenges and technical challenges are the ones that are easy

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:34.240
air quote easy they generally have pretty well-known solutions or like it's

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.160
kind of stuff we encountered before if I need to go write a new menuing system and

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.200
I've written a menuing system before I kind of have an idea I gotta fit it

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:50.560
within the context or I want to write whatever oh I every once in all for fun

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.440
so I can still feel irrelevant I go query some crap from github using their

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:02.600
API I know how to do it I didn't know how to use GraphQL to reduce my request so I

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.240
learned that but pretty pretty much a technical problem no can figure it out

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:12.360
answers are on the internet I can piece of stuff together adaptive problems are

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.520
where the fun stuff is this is the problems that you and I get to solve

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.880
Brent it's it's complex and systemic issues they requires changes and attitudes

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.320
behaviors and beliefs the solutions aren't clear we often have to start

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.240
before we know what the solution looks like there are things like culture

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:39.200
change you know adaptation and even just addressing resistance to change so in

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.440
this book Heffetz I mean it's not like a blueprint and there are no blueprints

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.080
but he gives some good ideas for helping people change stuff and what he

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.760
says is that you will no matter what change you're trying to make you will be

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.060
able to find allies but you have to look for no matter what change you're trying

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.670
to make you will absolutely have resistors and you're gonna have some

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.550
group in the middle who are kind of waiting to see what everybody else does

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:15.010
and go along for the ride so how do you do that how do you how do you like

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:20.090
let's say let's let's pick a modern testing principle give me a random number

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:29.040
between one seven okay so oh we want to improve the quality culture of our team

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.360
and this is actually well rolled because that's actually what the question was I

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.600
should know I should I should have went directly to that one but oh well undone I

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:47.000
basically basically when I quote unquote rolled I basically picked a number from

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.760
what was remaining after I eliminated one five and seven because those are the

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:56.760
only ones I still have memorized okay and and again there's no video but Brent

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.840
actually made the hand motion of rolling a die which is pretty cool by the way when

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.960
I was in New York I saw reason I couldn't record last week when my daughter

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:12.800
and I went to a sort of a live D&D improv show oh fun it was hilarious it

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.040
was hilarious lots of audience participation cool stuff going on was it

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.160
was there like an audience was there like a DM and an audience member like

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.120
actually rolling the dice or so there was a DM and it wasn't actually like a game

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.640
it was a it was roleplay but there were points in the story where they had to

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.720
we had to choose what they did or sometimes they had to roll and there

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.600
were some great rules for critical feathers or successes they did a really

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:43.280
good job having a scripted you know comedic show with some elements of

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.460
improv in it so pretty pretty impressed nice so people with a problem heffetz

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.900
find your allies yes good you know just just kind of walks through it you got to

00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:00.180
take a step back get to adapt assess you know just do a bunch of different

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:08.740
crap lots of lots of listening you know and and communication anyway lots of

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.520
tips in there what was it getting to no blueprint can't get there by yourself

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.950
but you have to you know we talk about experimentation and software when you're

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:27.870
trying to do organizational change you have to be even more experimentable

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:38.810
more of an experimenter do you yeah so maybe let's say okay equality thing I

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:44.090
want to get my devs to write all the automation if you're in a company you're

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.050
trying to get devs to write unit tests I'm sorry hopefully they can get fired

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.810
you can get better death let's say your let's say your devs are writing unit tests

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.530
but you but as you're led by the research you want to get them to write all

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:03.530
of the automation what we can say Brett before I go on well what I'm okay I'll

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:13.560
just say it say it say it okay so number one this reminds me and I don't know if

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:23.800
it'll end up being relevant this reminds me way back in the day you were

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:34.080
still at Microsoft agile was struggling you you actually had you did a an event

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.660
and you asked me to be one of the panelists yeah we have talked about this

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:46.860
event before this was yeah this was a a monumental event in the evolution of

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:55.510
Alan and Brent at Microsoft and in one of the questions because the so the panel

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.670
that Alan had done was us was a small group of people who who claimed to

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:07.310
successfully be using agile in in their business I want you to pause there I

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.990
want to give some more context okay so I ran this community of quality leaders

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:18.200
around the company and I got them together once a month I worked with these

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.480
great TPMs I worked with it was a cross-company thing we got them

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:27.950
together talking about a variety of subjects one of the things that's much

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:34.360
better now at Microsoft even I'll admit that I found embarrassingly funny at the

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:41.130
time was how maybe this is true at every company I don't know but then how a little

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:46.490
Microsoft would pay attention or regard anything that happened outside the walls

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:51.690
of Microsoft anything that wasn't happening at Microsoft may as well not

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.770
have been happening so I tried to like bring things like here's the thing that

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.170
maybe you've heard of that you want to know a little bit more about it

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.770
because maybe you heard someone on the bus all excited about it things like

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.210
that so agile was one of those so at that time which was years after agile

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:13.200
had been around so I put together this panel as Brent had described right and I

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:26.410
remember and so and this was this was a community of mostly testers and many of

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:35.530
them knew me because I had been in the testing community for a while and when

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:41.090
agile first came out I was on the same page as many of them had been at that

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:48.120
point in time around oh my god agile is the most dysfunctional thing ever that

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:58.430
has ever existed right and in some regards it was because a lot of dead

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:04.470
teams took control and they just the other thing that you didn't mention is

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.990
the dead teams that did go out and look at what other people were doing in this

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:18.700
space had decided that agile was an a la carte menu right yeah let's just I

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.980
think agile says don't do documentation we won't do that and we'll do whatever else

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:32.690
we want it'll be great right right we are now agile god yeah right in to which

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:41.450
Alan invented a whole new term fragile which to this day I still love and still

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:52.840
yeah sadly observe fucking ridiculous agile the now going back to the one of

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.280
the things that I remember for that to make it so that it's not a complete

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:03.440
freaking tangent is too late one of the questions one of the questions is like

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:13.740
okay how do we get people to do it and in essence I remember my answer which

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:23.120
was look if you go to your executives right at that point in time agile was on

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.160
the leading edge of the bubble but at least within Microsoft I mean it really

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.140
wasn't but within Microsoft correct as a whole it was like in that in that phase

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.380
where only you know people who aren't afraid of risk it was early adopterville

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:49.040
at Microsoft and and and people were like going to their executive and say

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.440
look internet says agile is the best thing we should do it and you look

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.320
back and I'm like okay you went to your executive and I'm sure you're

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.600
paraphrasing but you went to your executive and said we should do this

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.640
because you found a web page that said it's wonderful and we should do it and

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:19.090
you're surprised that they told you no shocked I'm shocked like well what's

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.410
funny is this complete tangent has somehow wound its way back to the trail

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:29.450
yeah I was taking the scenic route no that was great so if I hand you the

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:34.970
quality culture quality transition culture guide yep English Alan whatever

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.450
that thing is we made that shows like how to grow is a quality if I just hand

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:44.850
that to you this is great go do it people look at that and go um yeah great

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:50.830
thanks Alan and the foul it away making those things change is hard and and

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:58.390
again going back to what Shawn said browser overwhelmed with the level of

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:02.750
effort and potential will of those resisting and yeah it's a ton of

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:09.190
effort which is why you do a little bit at a time that whole concept of 1% better

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:15.630
every day works really well here so if it's getting devs to own more tests it's

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:21.310
do it a little don't say like this week you do integration tests next week we do

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:26.830
end-to-end after that you own it all no it's not gonna go that fast you have to

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:32.600
this is a line from leadership on the line you have to disappoint people at a

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:41.640
level they can absorb I have I have more I can add to that fire as well and

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.600
men so what you have to do I mean and the problem is that level they can

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.880
absorb is different for everyone those who are on like yeah let's do something

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.000
different you can they're disappointed of a little higher you can give them a

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.720
little bit more let's let's use you to walk the talk show me the example you're

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.800
my pilot group you're gonna try new things I'm gonna give you end-to-end

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.920
automation framework and you're gonna use that and we'll have that as an

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.560
example for when the other folks catch up these guys at the other end said

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.960
great it's okay your unit tests are great why don't we pair one day a week

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.920
on writing some integration tests and and we can get a shared understanding of

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.840
what those mean and get a little bit done you have to if you aim too high

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.080
you're going to be disappointed here cuz it's gonna be that's what it gets hard

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:39.120
it's it's never easy but it's easier if you target what you want to do based on

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.040
the capabilities and willingness of those people you're trying to move but you

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.800
have to go a little at a time brant you look very anxious to say something I

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.240
have a long set of things to say so I will I will mute and let you go okay

00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:05.480
so number one so you mentioned this book for me the primary books that I learned

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:11.840
from and then applied and then tweaked for this for those who care first and

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:21.340
foremost is influencers influencers is is a whole series around how to think

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:27.700
about how to execute the change and I'll go into some level of detail and explain

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:38.060
how it fits in even with Alan's paradigm the next one is getting to yes which is

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:46.160
a negotiation book because a lot of the times it's it's around when when Alan

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.860
was talking about okay you're fighting against the jerk well there there are

00:27:51.860 --> 00:28:01.100
techniques you can do to to change their argument in a way that then opens

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:07.620
the door and the third one is never split the difference which is another

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:13.280
negotiation book but unlike getting to yes getting to yes is sort of an IQ

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:20.980
version of negotiation where never split the difference brings in EQ which is

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:26.200
often even more important right if you can have a pure logical conversation

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:32.720
that's great you're probably negotiating with chat GPT which by the way is just

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:42.260
an AI it's gonna be easy for you to win that battle now when I go through trying

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:48.610
to institute a change one of the first things I will tell you is every

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:55.670
successful change involves changing something slightly in all three of people

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:01.870
process and technology people are gonna need to get trained technology is probably

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:07.870
going to need to change or written and then a streamlined process that that

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:12.630
bridges the two between these like if you create a whole new tech and no one

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:18.140
knows how to use it guess what they're gonna fall back to the old stuff now

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:24.530
the thing I like about the influencer stuff is they will break things down into

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:34.590
a six quadrant problem space and for me I'm highly analytical time my mathematical

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:45.380
brain got stuck six quadrants so imagine a two by three table with things that you

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:53.660
quadrants are fours okay I get you two by three go on

00:29:53.660 --> 00:30:08.000
six I don't know what that one is I don't know it was 24 of them or I'd know

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:18.260
how to do the math too many numbers it's now important so I'm typing so while

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.780
you're typing Brent's books are a little more mainstream than mine I go a

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.460
little bit off the beaten road but I made a little face on influencers it's

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:34.740
it's I it's good it's kind of and not from my it's fine getting to yes is fine

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:40.670
both valuable it's kind of like reading for those of you that have read them

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:46.980
those two books from Brent are like the DaVinci code the mainstream serpis thing

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.620
if you want to read something a little deeper a little more meaning out of it you

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:58.320
can read full cold spindle all right bread what'd you find out I'm still

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:04.560
waiting for are you asking chat GPT I am yeah it can't count either man it's

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:11.460
gonna make something up it's calls it a hexagon but I'm like no it's stupid it's

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.460
gonna make we know it's stupid it can't it's not a thing it's good at when you

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.540
know this you know better Brent I'm just gonna go with fuck you Ellen it's six

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:27.900
quadrants that answer is fair and we're gonna take that answer answer is fair

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:38.770
okay all right now when I go and analyze this like number one is yeah it's

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:47.760
convincing executives is absolutely possible like I now do it all the time

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:54.750
because I have worked with them enough to know what it is that that kind of

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:59.550
drives them what kind of the kind of decisions I kind of think you know my

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.190
experience a lot maybe it's because of I've grown as well but my experience the

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:10.150
last many years is executives aren't the hard sell no it's it's it's their

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:17.270
directs and and and then I do not believe I do not believe change other

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:25.140
than culture change change through executive mandate does not work or it

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:33.060
works in a very bad way no so the executive I know I know that is where you

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:39.270
were going no I wanted to be clear on that you need to it's a it's a it's a

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:44.110
people thing and and you met and stuff you mentioned too but most executives that

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:51.730
I know of will not say yes they'll defer yes if executives say anything they'll say

00:32:51.730 --> 00:33:01.740
no right and if they say no it's dead so now there's a bottoms-up approach a lot

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:06.080
of people try to do the top-down approach and that's kind of what you're talking

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:12.460
about oh if I can go to God and get him to add the 11th commandment then my

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:20.770
problem will just be solved it is it now going back to the the quadrants so it's

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:26.330
a two by three that you can think about and in and you can think about these

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:31.250
separately the first one I'm gonna go with the two like the very first set of

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:38.440
problems is okay what's stopping them from making this change is it motivation

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:44.640
or ability and that is an important thing right if they can't do what you're

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.960
asking to do because they just friggin don't know how and that's why they're

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:58.400
telling you know versus or they even perceive it to be hard which is usually

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:05.050
code language for I don't know how right versus motivation which is I don't

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:10.830
want to if I go down this path then I'm testing my own code instead of having

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:19.080
and sometimes it's a little of both or a lot of both right it is and it and if

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.120
you go through and think about them all and come up with a strategy that addresses

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:31.840
all of them you have a pretty good chance in here I mean all six quadrants

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:37.780
here you have a pretty good chance of succeeding in my experience and the other

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:42.060
thing that you want to do so now the three that I was talking to it's a two by

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:51.750
three so motivation ability but now the the cross grid thing rose right it's all

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:56.470
right the person that you're trying to or persons that you're trying to to

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:04.150
influence right what's their personal motivation or a bit of ability that

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:11.890
blocks this right there is science that shows that if you if you can propose

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:21.680
something that that hits their personal intrinsic motivations you have a much

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.460
greater chance of getting them to do it right or certainly you want to avoid

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:35.720
their intrinsic the allergies right then there's social pressure and then

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:42.330
they're structural but in structural social pressure is like use peer pressure

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:50.990
to your advantage right um hey if you can let's say you're on a team with with

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:56.700
three other sister teams and and your manager wants something done right but

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.920
one team just doesn't want to do it well if you get the other three and then start

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:06.790
changing the conversation around how we're all great except without

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:13.780
mentioning names one whole team seems to be slowing us down right no one likes to

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:23.640
be left out structural is structural changes or more things like just reminder

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:29.200
notes sometimes that's all people need like a sticker that says place the boxes

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:37.360
here or or static analysis tools that say hey are you sure you want to maybe

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.480
not static analysis I don't know what but it used to be called big red button is

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:50.670
what office uses a tool that says hey you're trying to push a PR and it

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:57.690
doesn't look like your unit test RAM are you sure right that sounds like clippy

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:06.000
for CI yeah yeah yeah yeah so what I have found now when we're talking about

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.340
social pressures and then you started hinting to this you do want to I have

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:19.020
found that if you if you start from the bottom for for things like MTP or in

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:25.060
this case we talked earlier about agile right you want to look around and say you

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:31.660
want to gather allies is what Alan said okay but in particular there is this just

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:39.820
fantastic term for the type of ally you want okay and that is the opinion

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:47.440
leader this is the person who if you could win them over they're going to

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.440
they're going to be a public ally for you this is one of those people that when

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.160
I was mentioned you know that one set of people are the ones that just don't

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.420
doesn't care see who wins and they just follow that you know the that Shepherd

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:10.430
you want to look for the shepherds and specifically target them and go and

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:19.710
figure out what holds them back how you can help in get them to a point where

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:26.470
they're open-minded might be and willing to try a few things out now of course the

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:32.510
trick is with that one is what you ask them to do you really got to set it up

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:36.670
to succeed so that they have a continuous experience of something

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:43.700
positive if you say oh go read the agile manifesto or go read I don't know

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:49.690
what's the agile manifesto for MTP I don't think there is one there isn't

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:55.410
what maybe it is MTP so thank you for making most of the points I was gonna

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.690
make so this is good good everything it's right and the way I put some of

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:05.050
those things just to reiterate is I talked about allies and the thing talked

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.610
about I like the way you said let me say I even wrote it down so I could remember

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:16.490
that's weird right it's weird on day it's people process and technology making

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.970
sure it's one or a combination of those not what you said that's my takeaway

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:25.960
and I focus a lot on the people side because that's the harder part but you

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.200
do have to balance it and it reminds me of the times like what's the best way

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.360
to get devs to make sure they're writing unit tests and putting them in CI or

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.680
sorry what you just talking about what's the best way to make sure that

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:47.620
Fred the dev is running unit test for HXN you make it automatic or so brain

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:56.690
dead easy it's harder to not do it you make it brain dead easy like from my

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:01.690
experience there's two things that you do number one you make it brain dead easy

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:09.650
for them to do it number two in the case they don't you reduce the friction

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:16.340
between what they did and it going to prod and you hold them accountable for

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:24.780
what's in prod and right and it happens all the time so we many many years ago

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:33.110
many years ago 2001 or so I worked with our development team on Windows CE to

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:39.740
help them learn to write unit tests and they asked the questions you'd expect of

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:44.300
a developer at Microsoft in 2001 they asked me things like if we're gonna write

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:50.340
unit tests for all of our code what is the test team going to do oh you know

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.440
what you know what that reminded me of what wait wait don't you know what that

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:01.400
really holds your thought that just reminded me of I had for I hadn't thought

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:07.080
about this in years and we didn't bring it up at 200 what to date is still my

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:14.560
view our second worst podcast ever I only know our first worst what's our

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:21.300
second worst the one where we thought it would be a good idea to do a

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:30.940
podcast any presentation oh that didn't work yeah yeah yeah they didn't like us

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.660
giving each other crap in the middle so whatever you know maybe now we can get

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.140
away with that people know us better that was like in the 20s or 30s we couldn't

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:45.040
get away with it but that was one of the questions that was asked okay if you

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.480
remember I don't remember dude I don't remember what we talked about two weeks

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:57.120
ago so anyway unit tests Windows CE if I think you worked on Windows CE a bit we

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:03.160
didn't overlap but doesn't it through Windows phone it doesn't matter we had a

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:10.490
the names don't matter all of our tests were contained in libraries DLLs on

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:16.250
Windows and run by an executable that could go find the test cases inside the

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:23.050
DLL and run them pretty cool pretty common way of doing it what so what I did

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:32.370
was I because I wrote a little wrapper application that could look it would go

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.530
through the functions in your code and create stub unit tests for all of them

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:40.940
and I just stumbled across the source code for it a while back it's it's

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.020
brute force dumb but it works so you want to write unit tests run this thing

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.700
but all you have to do is fill in the crap make it easy to get started then

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.180
they can expand from there you compare with them coach etc etc find ways to make

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:59.580
it easy to do I wrote a little bit ago about a CI system we wrote for that team

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:04.980
before we know it was CI was just made it easy for people to do the things they

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.820
were supposed to do I was on another product once where we wrote a test that

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:15.410
would run in the background as you changed code and that's kind of what I

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:19.330
mean if you look at what co-pilot does today it kind of looks at your code gives

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:23.770
you some ideas you could see that expanding and doing static analysis and

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:28.210
other things in the background helping you fix your code maybe even and this

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:31.090
probably somebody's probably written this somewhere but I'm gonna go ahead and

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:36.560
imagine it hasn't for a minute so bear with me an a generative AI could as

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.700
I'm writing code not only give me suggestions as co-pilot does search

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.460
through a bunch of different static analysis tools and find potential errors

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.540
for me and flag them and create unit tests for my code and run them in the

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.940
background on my code and let me know if I was writing buggy code as I'm

00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.180
writing it probably somebody's probably already written that not a big deal

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:05.020
it's free but anyway we talked about pilot I think couple things you didn't

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:10.020
mention is once you get those allies you collect that data you can tell a

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:14.540
story you can you can you can use that because sometimes those people who are

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.940
lagging they just want the data to show sometimes they'll ignore it what's

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:23.760
really good is peer pressure so and what and the way I do peer pressure is

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.280
probably at least two ways I'm counting on my fingers you can't see them but

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:35.460
one is just to celebrate the behavior you want to see team X wrote a full

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.260
suite of end-to-end tests they're running and monitoring they run within 20

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.300
minutes if they're running on every build is great call it off for the team

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:50.120
they go oh wow people often people people gonna tell me I'm wrong that just

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:56.400
being recognized for doing something is a lot more than you know giving him a

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.390
gift card or sending him out to dinner giving him whatever people like

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:06.750
recognition depending on culture you may not so use peer pressure there um game

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:15.940
if I give people badges I'm Iowa I want to give people badges in github for for

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:21.990
doing the right thing I'm just I just gonna ask like did has my I was still at

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:26.980
Microsoft I would wonder can we get all of Microsoft code into github because

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.860
everything's so silent you're not telling me don't don't tell me any

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:35.750
secrets anything be kind of cool but I want I would so number one I don't think

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:42.430
it all is but honestly the where it isn't I'm not certain anyone really cares

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:49.080
yeah yeah cuz at the time when I left it was all in I'm gonna call it visual

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:56.880
studio team system and not Azure DevOps that's a dumbass name so anyway badges

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.440
are a great way people go to somebody's report check out their code to see look

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:08.700
at all the badges you guys you guys are the shit yeah and I guess was just two

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:14.160
things so celebrate the behaviors you want to see game if I and or find any

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.000
other way you can use peer pressure you can because that'll make it'll make a

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.760
difference lots of little things you know you just inspired an idea I'm like

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:35.360
no no because I was thinking you know if I don't badges sure but to me badges are

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:42.720
are honestly they feel childish but you know what that doesn't feel childish to

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:51.030
me that's essentially the same thing is achievements yeah yeah yeah yeah and I'm

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:59.790
like you know what it wouldn't take much like ADO probably wouldn't wouldn't

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:05.900
agree to integrate it but it wouldn't because all of their stuff out of the ADO

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:12.840
stuff that we use at Microsoft is available in in public databases I'll

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:20.510
be there's nothing stopping me from inventing my own shell and you can and

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.910
you could allow people with your teams with a high gamerscore they're allowed

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:31.070
to check in on Friday I I mean putting their shit into an iFrame is like the

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:36.070
easiest thing on the planet I'm like that's an idea now of course the problem

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:49.210
is I have to have time to do things like that and exactly exactly hey we have we

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:55.210
have covered a lot of stuff and we could probably keep on talking for their

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.890
hour on this but if you have more questions you can shove them in the mail

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:04.340
big channel but I kind of think we should wrap it up there everything you

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.900
but after this one last code a bit that Brent wants to mention we can we can now

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:15.660
I was just thinking through okay so and I what we really did is answered you

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:20.860
know we answered their question at a strategic level like we listed off a

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:27.100
number of strategies around doing this right order of ignorance number four

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:32.140
they didn't they didn't have one we gave them like a method by which we're giving

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:36.060
them a means to discover what they don't know they don't know is there anything

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:44.290
technical like the way they they said enterprise level change so that to me

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:49.050
invokes I think they're talking about things like are in the quality culture

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:55.180
transition guide so not really they may need a testing for I know no not really

00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:02.350
no okay it's people and knowledge people and knowledge it's not as good as the

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:07.190
real 202 but I think we did a good job you know it's it's it's a start back

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:12.120
it's a start and you know what if it's not if you hated the whole thing and

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:16.320
you're still well one if you're still listening it doesn't make any

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:21.960
difference we don't have any ads yet at least so nobody got paid and you paid

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.240
zero except for your time with this podcast if it sucks you know what your

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:34.330
loss but given that let me pause and mention that we are on audible.com and if

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:40.450
you really don't get we are but I mean I bet Alan doesn't even remember the code

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:49.530
you're a horrible at bad jokes so um all right so let's call that day he is

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:55.930
Brent I am and I'm not we'll see you later bye
