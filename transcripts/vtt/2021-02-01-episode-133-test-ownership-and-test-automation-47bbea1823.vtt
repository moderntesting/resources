00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:13.460
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.580
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.080
This is the AV testing podcast and I'm

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:30.700
Brent and yay is this episode 133 is that correct that is and by now everyone should be finding our podcast

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.780
I change hosts for a couple reasons and it didn't go as smoothly as I wanted because I realized that

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.960
One I thought it was bad that a lot of a lot of

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.980
Podcast hosts make their own feeds which actually I can see what they do that

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.820
So I'm not mad at them

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.620
But it turns out a lot of them base their feed purely on the iTunes feed which is weird versus the source feed

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.020
But that's okay, but it just took longer to get the Apple iTunes feed updated, but it looks like it's all set

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.220
So now you should be hearing this. This is our second podcast of 2020

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.780
We love all of you. And hey, do you know how you find out more about the podcast Brent you go to?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.940
AB testing calm you do not go to a B testing calm

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.400
What are we talking about on here a thing that's not really modern and a thing that's not really testing

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.800
You know the answer to that question Brent. Yes

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.320
Yes, I do you can go to modern testing org

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.560
You oh, oh, I guess I didn't which is the site a domain

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.480
We got a couple years ago for start talking about this that used to direct to a B testing

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.560
On my angry weasel site, but now it goes to actual modern testing org

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.380
I've set it up as a real website

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.260
Nice. Yeah

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.540
It's not super pretty but happy to take volunteer web developers and the way to get involved with anything you want

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.560
Behind the scenes on the podcast is to go to modern testing org and in the sparse amount of text there

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.260
Find the link to join our slack group one of the three dot slack comm

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.350
How's that for an intro and get everybody hooked? I'll give you a minute to go find that website and log in and say hi

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.860
Right the clone the github repro and yeah, we got we got

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860
Typing while he's talking again

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.480
Which I don't like well, I can't remember we were recording when I said that the hard time thing is I can't punch you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.400
We were weren't me. Okay?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.520
The first things first before we get starting with a couple topics today is Brent wanted to talk about balls. I did

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.070
And you can't see this on the podcast, but right behind me in my

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.070
luxurious office here in East Seattle otherwise known as Issaquah Washington is

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.790
some balls is a mighty fine stack of some big balls

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.450
soccer balls except for one rugby ball the rugby balls the outlier I got that on a trip to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.530
New Zealand that Australia that's an Australian

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.870
Replica rug just a souvenir rugby ball. I got in Australia the rest are ever since

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.090
For many years. I don't have all of them up there, but for the past

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.170
But for the past

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.810
2024 years or so I

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.970
Have procured myself every year they design it every four years when there's a World Cup

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.480
That's a tournament for soccer or football. It's a game

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.320
It's the most populous one in the world but popular but anyway, Oh Super Bowl. That's like in two weeks. Oh god

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.120
I don't even know who I lost interest

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.240
Although the funny tangent is here, but I'll finish the story first

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.440
No tangent is I every World Cup

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.200
They make a specific ball and I get a ball from that World Cup and save it never play it

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.200
I just kind of I have brand new

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.880
soccer balls footballs from every World Cup back to

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.600
Before Korea so it must have been it maybe back to the US run the first US run anyway

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.880
What was I gonna tangent on I don't remember doesn't matter the Olympics?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.400
the Olympics no

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.120
Wrong. Oh

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.410
guess again

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.180
All right, so okay one thing I'm curious though so one of the soccer balls

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.940
Looks like it's impaled by a frisbee

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.900
That is purely an optical illusion. There's actually some other crap laying up there. It's not a soccer ball

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.940
It's just balls and a couple of things they threw up there

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.840
Gotcha. All right, cuz I was wondering what the hell that was but it's an optical illusion it all right

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.240
Thanks for coming to our podcast everyone

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.560
We can skip the politics session for this week up. There's stuff happening and there's still idiots just like always they're just more prominent now

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.520
Don't you want to do the the podcast podcast or is it too early in the episode for that?

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.330
It I mean, it's uncharacteristic early. We're like five minutes in

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.690
I feel like we should just like wait for five minutes and then start but why don't maybe maybe ten minutes in

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.130
No

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.170
Why don't we do this?

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:19.770
Cuz this is because sometimes we talk about like what's been going on and and why don't we talk about the article?

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.570
I posted two weeks ago. Maybe it's

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.250
Tuesday of last week and

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.720
We talked let's talk about that so yeah last time on the podcast

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.800
Insert clip here. No, I'm too lazy

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.880
We were talking about this idea of mindsets and skill sets and how it never quite sat right and I was working on an article on it

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.160
And I went that weekend after the podcast and finished the article. I just needed to get some ideas going and

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.120
posted to

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.680
Exactly the reaction I expected and the gist of the article if you haven't read it you can

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.640
Find it in my five for Friday last week or in my Twitter feed. I don't have the URL memorized

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.860
But it's on the the blog test project IO and the gist of it was that I

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.900
argued the fact that folks like

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.140
Michael Bolton James Bock have posted that

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.380
Shifting from a creator's mindset to a testers mindset requires a massive and difficult mind shift. I I poo pooed that and

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.240
Gave some examples. I said those are really skill sets and

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.720
There's no block that developers can't do very very good testing and as expected

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.880
90% of the replies were duh. Yeah. Thank you. It's it's funny how I can get this happens a lot

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.880
because I'd like to try and tow the line a little bit is

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.380
For as many people as I get I get people agreeing, but I also get people saying this is old news

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.480
Why are people still talking about this? This is dumb and other people thinking like I'm killing a cat

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.420
I'm on the the old news camp, right? There's a reason why we call what we've done

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.000
modern testing

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.800
the other thing to point out that I always want to point out is you're probably gonna get to but I'm on a roll and

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.040
I'm riled up is that sorry go for it

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.200
Didn't invent anything with modern testing and we've been accused

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:27.200
I've been accused of inventing something that's harming the craft and Brent. Did we invent anything at all?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.320
Um that answer is no we we invented a name

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.200
Yeah, we put a name to something that we were seeing if you go back to our very very first podcast

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.460
Don't listen to it. Trust me. We're much better now as bad as it is. We're better now

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.920
We would we just wanted to talk about what we were seeing to help people who may be going through the same thing not freak out

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.680
and

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.840
What we see is people putting their heads in the sand and freaking out if people want to give us

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.240
Credit for this obviously it's wrong and inappropriate

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.430
It's it's interesting because I actually

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.990
As you know

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.190
We are not harming the craft the craft

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.870
has

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.390
long since been under threat and

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.390
What we are doing

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.510
For those who listen are

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.710
protecting

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.710
the craftsmen

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.740
Right. It's essentially

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.380
God normally I can load a metaphor here

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.180
Right, but there's a long biscuit in a wood shredder

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.780
Right. No, no, I'm thinking of

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.980
Normally I go back to

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:53.980
Cobalt right or or cobalt not cobalt. That's cobalt is an element cobalt is a programming language

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.540
While I am chronologically older that you are a dimension old man go on

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:07.900
Yeah, I definitely resemble that fact like Alan to me in some regard like continuing this discussion on

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.660
Is test dying blah blah blah. I

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:18.940
Won't even play that game anymore. No, it's it's like I'm already starting conversations and starting to bring up

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.160
That my view we are right now

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.750
at the beginning of the end of the data science

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:35.710
Specialist there there will be people holding on to that specialty for decades as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for sure

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.630
It's especially I went to school for this I studied this I've put a lot of heart and soul into it

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.630
Please don't take it away. I'm unwilling to adapt

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.740
There will be that

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.660
Maybe maybe the problem is right now

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.890
there's a glut of folks coming out of school with that and

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.570
They're not able to to sort of land the job in the career

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.370
And that would be true even if we weren't in a in the midst of a covid nightmare

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:12.270
So what one point I want to make and of course I I have Bolton and Bach muted

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:18.490
Not blocked but muted on Twitter. So sometimes they can show up. I don't sure how the meeting algorithm works actually

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.730
but it was pointed out to me that the response to

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:28.290
Bach on my article was that I thought it was interesting. I see exactly where he's coming from but I think it's bullshit as well

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.930
he said something to the effect of

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.170
Unless Alan you've studied social sciences, you really don't get testing

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.650
Which says two things to me one is for the testing

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.610
one

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.610
first answer, huh

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.500
to I don't know how I mean sure if you want to

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:58.340
I'm not gonna deny some applicability. Maybe and I'm giving in the benefit of the doubt on number two, but number three is

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.040
Huh again, so for number three, it's just I don't care

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.370
Repeat the quote it was I'm paraphrasing

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.090
It was people do is if they're not quite sure how to engage me on something

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.290
They know that Bolton and Bach will be pissed about they just tag him they tag him in a Twitter and

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:25.570
Apparently Bach came in I just glanced at it cuz again cuz how meat works but something to the effect of

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.170
Unless you've been studying social sciences is the art

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:34.090
This isn't really what they're doing isn't really testing and that's what I wanted to get to is

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.530
historically

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.610
historically, if you look what Bach has done to

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.650
Elizabeth Hendrickson and

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:49.450
Lisa Crispin where he's I've seen him say like because he hasn't seen them test. They're not good testers and

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.250
it's like he has the

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:59.810
Authority to decide what good testing is and what good testing isn't and he doesn't not in a million years, you know who gets to decide

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:06.850
Nobody actually cut customers closely. They get to value a quality and here's the trick. Here's the thing you and I

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.000
Agree on which comes out to be the crux of all these these people who get stuck in

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.760
Celebrating the craft is they care

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.560
1000% more about testing than they do about quality

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.300
Yes

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.860
Slaps me in the face. I suck. I just do not get how you can

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.740
So I love the craft and I was deep in the man. I'll learn a lot about testing

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.380
I know a lot about testing. I'm gonna talk about testing

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.940
I'm gonna write a book about testing

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.740
But which I did as you know, and I don't like it anymore because I care about now is quality customers

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:49.100
Don't care what testing we did. They don't care if I'm a skilled practitioner of the arts and social scientists and testing

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.740
They don't care if I could ask a hundred and one

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:58.780
Totally dumb straw man argument questions about testing. They care if the product solves their problem in a way that they enjoy

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.410
Just say true. Hallelujah. Amen

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.690
True. Hallelujah and

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.460
Amen

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:14.260
Part of the I mean, there's so many things that came out and what you were just saying like number one

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:22.010
I don't know what you're doing, but get to the point we talked about this last time. So let's let's get get to it, man

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.490
Number one

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.290
Yeah, there is a good deal of

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.370
Ivory Tower ism in his statement there, right? It's

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.490
Unless you have studied

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.170
Sociology

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.810
I'll find the quote and again coming from where he's coming from and again

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.930
Every behavior has a motivation. Oh

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.340
Sure, and I'll look up the tweets here a second

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.480
I'll stop trying to type while I or type on my phone while I talk but

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.060
from his view

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:03.300
Testing is the most important thing doing good testing his client

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.940
his only stakeholder is the person who's made that software and

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.380
First so for that angle. Yeah, he wants to do the very best job find the best report

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.820
give the give the stakeholder all the information because

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:21.700
From that school they're not decision makers or information providers and for a lot of people it's all about the customer

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:28.760
So the focus is different. So we think about things differently. I get where he's coming from. I vehemently disagree with it

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:35.220
But he's not spouting nonsense as much as I really kind of don't like the guy. I think he's smart

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:41.640
What he's essentially saying like you and I have talked about many a times

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:48.680
That the activity of testing is important. Number one, huh?

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:55.160
No argument. No argument number two and in the end

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:01.160
I guess number three the thing that so that's one place. I think we're in VM an agreement

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.640
The the thing that I guess continues to be fuddle me is

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.540
Given the this amounting evidence

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.940
On your side on on on the mindset discussion

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.140
All right, it being a skill set versus a might say let me let me give you the exact

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.700
exchange

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.610
When you're when you're ready, let me get I'm gonna give you the exact exchange. I don't want to go too deep into this

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.530
I don't feel it's fair regardless of my opinions

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.690
I don't want to go into rank on somebody on the podcast when I wouldn't engage him on Twitter

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.010
But I went and looked it up because I only glanced at it

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:43.200
Uh when it was pointed out to me responding to my post with my article someone replied and of course tagged in michael and james

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.200
And said oh they brought up the idea of the problem of critical distance

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.680
Which is a nice term that I could find very little information on to define it and try and rebut it but the idea is

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:05.760
That because I wrote it. I can't test it which again. My reply was I found this theory to be largely false in my experience

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.540
Which is absolutely true. I'm not not trying to be provoking

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:15.300
I have found people that I have found critical distance to be not just false but a flat out falsehood

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.270
Which is the same thing?

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.910
So then uh james jumped in and said in my experience

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:26.710
You've never studied this stuff or did you start reading the literature on cognitive biases boundary objects social forms of life and sense making

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.390
While we weren't looking which I thought was kind of a passive aggressive dick move

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.550
Oh, I didn't look at the replies, but there's more after that but the thing is

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:40.790
We're coming from different places and and I like to believe i'm coming from a place

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:46.150
That's going to help people who are in test rules be not just keep their jobs

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.830
Which some people are worried about and worried about the right testing happening

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:56.630
What we're talking about on the podcast. I want to help people freaking thrive as software changes in a day

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.190
And figure out how they can take all of this

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:05.430
I already closed the tweet cognitive social stuff and apply it to all this stuff if you do it, right?

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:13.270
It applies to building an entire learning organization like peter singe talks about which I that's a that's a what I try and strive for

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:20.410
I use everything I learned in the critical thinking and systems thinking that I used as a tester to build an organization

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.510
that is capable of

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:30.630
Delivering predictably and with high quality. I use the same skills. I just don't use them to do one aspect of software delivery

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.040
uh, agree

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.340
agreed

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.220
but the other thing I was going to say on this one because I have the thread loaded up and

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.740
And bach was coming in with all sorts of

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.300
You know

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.300
How social creatures work?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:53.960
Right, and that's actually one of the things I think is brilliant around like we've talked about it repeatedly on on tvd

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.220
the one of the things that's brilliant about tdd

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.620
is

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:06.100
The the person's writing the test before the code. Yes. It does it does it solve cognitive bias? No

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.060
But damn alan, it sure helps mitigate it

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:18.470
Right it just just in the fact that it creates a much better code base for for testing

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:25.270
In general it it reduces the that risk and in terms of cognitive bias

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.150
Right, i'll just be quite honest

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.870
even if test were

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.330
That the assumption there is test is able to maintain objectivity

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.470
And and not be biased as they go through their testing

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.880
and

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.600
That that by itself is fundamentally false

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:53.920
Right, even if their statements were true, I would argue that that that it that occurs even amongst the craftsmen

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.240
today

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.440
so

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.440
in my mind that that that

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.430
That statement is true on both sides and therefore can be safely ignored

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:14.020
The one thing that puzzles me here, right and this is the thing and we can go on to another topic if you want. Um

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.180
After this but the one thing I just don't understand

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.820
If they view your

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.820
Article and we don't have evidence here

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.540
But if if your article is viewed as a as a direct threat to sort of, you know

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.700
the dogma that that they're talking

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.720
in the face of

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.530
Of the by not the bias in the face of the the evidence that we that we're seeing

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.330
that contradicts this

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.410
Contradicts their point of view

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.210
Like I I just don't understand like I I completely agree that that

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.250
testing is is important

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.290
But why are they so reluctant?

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.140
to

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.740
Encourage and invite and market amongst developers

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.620
Well, why are they so reluctant?

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.580
Why now why this you already stole my next topic, but yeah, and this is why maybe

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.860
I can't get in their heads. I don't want to actually insert myself into other feeds they've had

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.820
Many of our listeners have heard those but

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:26.450
I want to skip that but if you look at one of the things I love about elizabeth hendrickson's exploratory testing book

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:31.810
Is it specifically talks about teaching developers exploratory testing?

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:38.210
And what i've noticed in my everything, you know, I I don't just make this stuff up

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.690
We watch stuff. I read I read books and articles and try and put it all together

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.650
I want to look for a full system's view of what's happened

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.050
Not just what you and I are seeing what's happening across the industry

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:53.810
And I got to tell you what I find more and more and more is when we go to highlight stuff

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.530
Like think of everything we've highlighted

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:02.450
Chances are I can find an example of elizabeth hendrickson highlighting it eight to ten years before we did

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.360
Yeah, well, she is pretty awesome listening to

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:13.160
Uh the ideal cast by jean kim and i've tweeted a couple times about this so worth calling up here and I listened to her episodes

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:19.580
Specifically there's one that's an interview and one there's some outtakes of a conference talk she gave in 2014 and 2015

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.880
That kind of backed up the point. She was talking for a while around

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.920
This article that she wrote with some other folks and chem caner what they did. There's like 17 of these tests

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
This is like 2001

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.770
This is a ways back. This is when you and I still thought testing was the schnitzel

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:44.050
Yeah, and she was meeting with these folks and they're trying to answer the age-old question. What's the right ratio of developers to testers?

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:49.730
And as you know, microsoft used to be almost one to one and windows was almost two to one in some groups

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.010
And they want to answer when I started when I started it was two to one

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.490
So the way they did it yeah

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.890
And what my answer has always been even very early on I what I was in

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.910
I didn't really care about it

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:06.630
I was in ee and had to think about engineering excellence group at microsoft and I realized the only

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.590
When did I join that group about 2005? So i'm still behind

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.030
The only right answer for that question is it depends

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:18.630
Or as I learned to put it shortly after if you're asking about ratios you're asking the wrong question

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.610
so

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:26.690
What they did as a thought experiment a good little affinity exercise was they asked people to think of

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:31.730
What was the ratio on the team that had the best project ever as far as delivery and quality?

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.010
What was the ratio of devs to test and what was the worst quality?

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.530
What was the biggest on the biggest train wreck you ever worked on? What was the ratio?

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:46.290
And they didn't find a lot of correlation on the high quality products, but they found massive correlation on

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:52.530
The low quality train wreck products. They all had a very high tester to developer ratio

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.560
You and I are not surprised

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.920
2001 you and I may have been surprised. I gotta tell you that

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.120
So in passing there one of the things she said this is

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.080
She just gets it but she like you and I we try and stir the water. She just knows she's like the

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.440
She's like the obi-wan Kenobi waiting for us to learn this stuff. I think

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.120
she

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:19.400
Said just in passing was talking about a test team like I can't even fathom the idea of a dedicated test team

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.270
Like I don't even get why that would even be a thing anymore

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.950
And you know, it is a thing and people are proud of their dedicated test teams

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:35.890
Anyway, the point you got to on ownership is interesting and I want to use that or or actually the point you made that I just totally

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.970
Screwed the pooch on the point you made was why aren't they talking to developers about doing better testing?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.120
And

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.760
I have an answer but it's flippant even though I think it's right

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.120
So i'm going to skip it

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.320
But I want to talk about developer testing and it's sort of a piggyback on that last article. I wrote

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.680
Let me go back to 2015 when I went to google test automation conference in kirkland

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:05.090
Uh, it was the second or third one. I went to and a whole bunch of talks. I wasn't presenting. I was just watching

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.030
It was in kirkland

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.310
You know

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.310
Humans are good at pattern matching

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:16.070
And very quickly I noticed a pattern that if I would have turned into a drinking contest would have killed me

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.460
This is how many times each talk

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.340
Said the two-word phrase

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.090
Flaky tests

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.090
I wanted to call it the flaky test conference

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.690
It's a problem that you and I have dealt with for years and years and years

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:36.050
Developers write about and this is especially true, especially true today in the world of selenium

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.150
and

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.870
Lots of automation teams not only is a dedicated team dedicated test automation team

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.880
And they write a bunch of tests and

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.760
They're proud of the fact they have a hundred thousand tests

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.680
But 5 000 of them are weird and flaky and they do things like run them again or run them 10 times or they pass once

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.640
That's good. I'll just delete them because they don't want to run the flaky test only ones. Don't tell us any information

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.040
And that bugged me and there's a solution for this. I want to get to

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.550
but

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.670
the other thing I was going to mention is

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.900
Accelerate

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.020
In you've heard us mention this book called accelerate written by nicole forest green and some other people

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.100
We love that book

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.620
People love the dora metrics. The um, the the four devops metrics that tell you if you're going to be high quality

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.780
Well a lot of reviews of the book leave out some other important

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.180
Indicators of quality and there's one you've highlighted on the podcast before

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:41.380
I want to highlight for you then i'm going to ask you a question and stop talking that you answer and ponder for me

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.180
Okay, she's talking about automated testing

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.900
In the book. Yes, and she says

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.600
First the code becomes more testable when developers write tests

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.000
Second when developers are responsible for the automated tests

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.440
They care more about them and will invest more effort into maintaining and fixing them

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.880
And what she's found here is the thing she's underlying is that

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:13.520
When developers own the automated testing those tests are higher quality in the products higher quality is a correlation between developers owning the tests

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.600
and product quality

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.800
So let me give you a rant with a setup statement and i've talked i've been on my soapbox almost long enough here

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.880
so given that there's scientific correlation proving this

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:33.680
And given that in my experience writing especially ui end-to-end automation is one of the most difficult programming tasks

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.640
you can do properly and non-flaky and

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.780
Given the fact that almost every time I talk to folks who write these sort of end-to-end

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:47.220
Ui automation tests they're doing it because it's the only level that the code is testable at

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.860
Given all this data

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.620
Why don't?

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.620
I see a given developers should write every single automated test

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.740
ever always

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.660
And that'll even piss off some of our listeners

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:05.060
I know we have avid listeners who love what we do who still spend a lot of their day writing test automation

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.820
I don't think it works. I think it's we've fallen into this weird rut where it's work that the developers don't want to do

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.300
But all according to studies here and according to everything i've seen it results in lower quality

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.620
If you want to raise the quality of your team

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.540
Everyone if you're not developing the code don't write automated tests for it

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:28.660
Number one, I mean do you want I mean I completely agree with everything that you're saying like what what well agree with it in

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.780
An elegant way that will allow our listeners to get a second point of view and be less mad at me and while I can ever

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.100
Yeah

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:41.860
Like I i'm still thinking around the prior conversation in the cognitive bias issue. Okay, um

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.180
one of the issues he even if

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.420
test had

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.380
uh

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.380
perfect ability to

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:57.940
To look at the code and be objective and and do the right thing which which again they don't

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.140
Uh, because they turned out to be just as human as the developers who wrote the code. Okay

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.260
It is very rare in my experience

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.880
that test has

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.370
sufficient power

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.620
For action to be taken

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.140
Okay, um

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:23.260
And of course the rst model will will address that because that's not their job. Their job is to provide information

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.240
okay

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.440
And information provided that no one takes action on

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.690
has um

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.540
I would imagine

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.420
a remarkably low impact to quality

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:41.930
Now even even further one of the things that that they called out

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:50.710
So that study that that that nicole did in in accelerate it calls out two things. It's essentially

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.750
they found

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.170
that

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.110
automation

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:03.110
Only correlated to a high functioning software. I forget their actual definition

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.190
But to good software

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.070
When the dev owned the automation

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.710
right

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:16.550
In other words when test owned it they found no correlation to that automation

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:24.150
Improving the software no and an anecdotal I can tell you why and there are only people that will dismiss this. Let me explain

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:29.190
I don't think this is going to be made up. Let me tell you why this works

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:36.230
I find it funny that the only I'm going to start with the test pyramid and I find it funny that the only people who

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:42.790
gripe about it and try and uh dismiss it as as useless are testers

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:48.390
So all the test automation pyramid says people get freaked out about the model

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:53.110
Of course, all models are useful and some are wrong. The reason why it works is today

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.910
Developers write code most developers

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:02.230
We're getting to a point where I think the vast majority of developers at least write unit tests and i'm on the record saying

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.230
That's a minimum job requirement

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.540
Which is great. They write nice little happy path test to make sure things work as expected

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.030
But then they throw stuff over the wall

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:16.710
So the the the shit they're throwing over the wall is just less smelly than it was 20 years ago in many cases

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.350
so what happens is

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.030
with

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:28.310
Poorly architected code we get these testers trying to test all these end-to-end scenarios almost black box like

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.750
I see questions all over the internet all over forums all over twitter on

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:40.230
What do I do to make selenium find this element? I it's really hard

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:45.510
I have to use an x-path and even though it's ugly sometimes it changes and my tests are really flaky

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.380
Yeah, absolutely true

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.900
The big answer to those is get your devs to add ids to your elements, which is great, but

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.700
They go how do I get my devs to do that?

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.260
If it doesn't help it's like a it just is a sad sad story to watch

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.180
so

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.860
Let's flip that around and watch what happens when a developer owns those tests because developers like

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.260
And maybe I think it's fair to say that most developers are lazy

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.700
The good ones are the best developers. I know are also lazy

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:23.260
And if they get to the point they have to write this this automated test in selenium and they go well, this sucks

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.220
I don't want to write this test. This is a stupid waste of my time

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.500
So then they go fix their code and they fix their architecture

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.980
So they can test for things that need to be tested at the lowest possible level

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:41.820
only in the environment where they don't have a tester because as you call out developers are lazy if they have a tester

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.940
And came with a with a five-word email

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:53.020
The second they own the automation they will fix their architecture to make the code more testable and

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.100
guaranteed

00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:01.020
What they end up creating will look a lot more like the test pyramid because they're only going to write those big flaky ugly tests

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.820
For things that can absolutely only be tested there

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.020
and it doesn't mean there's not a role for people with

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:14.060
Critical thinking and actually that's a I don't like that because I think a lot of developers have those skills. They aren't like

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.340
Special things that only people who've been blessed with a special testers mindset can have

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.740
Nicole does go on to say it's the point I wanted to talk about in that same paragraph

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.060
She does say none of this means that we should be getting rid of testers

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:33.580
Testers serve an essential role in the software delivery cycle. I disagree with her slightly

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.420
I

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.000
in

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.680
There's a lot of caveats there. I think she's trying to I think she's weaseling out a little bit. Love you. Nicole. Sorry

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.200
I think she did wanted to avoid any backlash there, but you and I both know it can now

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:54.440
I think the point here she wants to avoid is the cult of oh, I've heard teams don't need testers

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.760
Let's get rid of them all it's ripping off the band-aid when it's a tourniquet

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.040
It's getting rid of the net without first lowering the rope

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.280
That's I think

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:12.440
There are caveats there, but uh, so I can see where she's coming from but yeah, you can absolutely make world-class high-quality software

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.920
Without any dedicated testers on the team

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.640
Conversely and as I tweeted

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:23.320
You can you and I won't pick will it some a self-proclaimed testing expert of their own choice pick

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.520
The top five testers in the world if you put them on a dysfunctional product team

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.960
There's no way they're ever going to ship anything that customers like

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.320
Well with the typical with the typical

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.490
Process to use that i'm used to

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.890
Right because when you have that then

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.770
The the dev team optimizes for hey, it's fun time. I get to write more code

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.530
and

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.530
When when we ship shit?

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.850
Uh, I get to be blameless

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.210
And that doesn't help the business. It doesn't help the customer

00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:01.930
Right. Um, so we have data from nicole that says that developer owned automation is better for your product

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.970
Yeah, so given that

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:06.650
and

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.090
how much

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.210
There's this

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.010
I'll say it there is a industry

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.730
infatuation with end-to-end tests that's that's unhealthy

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:23.770
Agreed to me. The solution is obvious have the devs own it the right architecture will happen both in the testing test automation architecture

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:30.010
And in the dev architecture, it's it's it couldn't if it was painted in pink paint actually i'm red color blind

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.090
If it was painted in yellow paint

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.650
a thousand feet high

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:36.890
It couldn't be more clear to me

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.430
Why is it that?

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.670
industry wise we uh

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:47.270
We're not there. What am I seeing or what's wrong with my view because it's so obvious to me

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:52.630
How come as an industry we're still infatuated with having people who aren't the developers of the code

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:57.190
Try it and write end-to-end tests for it as the primary means of testing. Uh, please

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.390
Because

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.830
No

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:03.190
You know the answer to it. It's because it's seductive

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.230
Like you can get a really low trained

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.790
a low skilled person

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.880
Uh to try it out again

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:20.200
Why take the thing that look i've written shipping software in operating systems used by millions and millions of people and i'm telling you

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:26.360
Writing non flaky end-to-end automation is harder. I would rather go fix kernel bugs

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.560
I'd be more confident about changing the windows kernel or the xbox kernel same thing

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.440
Than I would about trying to write an end-to-end test. That was always going to be value and non flaky

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.720
Yeah, and we're going to put newbies on that here

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:47.240
Go for it. No, it it's again because well and you've seen it right? It's it's ui. It's newbies

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.800
Right. You just hook up

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.680
You just hook up to a recorder script and just click around and look you got a kick-ass

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.600
uh automation suite and actually I want to say because

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:04.520
Reproduces that continuously will reproduce the results until the next build. Here's the thing

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.840
I want to interrupt you because yeah, go ahead. I think these click and record things

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.520
I used to hate them and think they were stupid because I was thinking about them as a

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.080
Trying to create a test suite

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.440
But it gives me a way to do some exploratory automation

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.240
Like I just here I want to go do this set of actions a thousand times and I don't care if it fails

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.360
I'm just going to do the clicky clicky clicky record and then wrap it in a loop and go home for the night

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:36.040
That's valuable. It's not a test. I'm going to run on every build, but it gives me an opportunity to do what I call exploratory test automation

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.160
Let me link together some actions. Let me make a monkey test

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.240
The other thing right so because it's a monkey test

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:50.680
Right. That's what attracts the that's why it's attractive to assign these two sort of low-scale people

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.680
Right because because well, let's not let's hire a better monkey in some regards

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:03.720
Right, but the problem is these low-skilled people don't have the experience around what's going to take to maintain it

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.120
what it's going to take to actually get it to work and

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.960
I think in some regard like at the end of the day here is one place where I will say

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.200
I won't use our typical answer of it depends

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.160
Because here like I don't have an answer, but I know where the answer is

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.760
And the answer is going to be let's follow the incentive model

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.740
Let's let's go follow

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.900
How people are reviewed?

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.220
Let's go follow

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:39.580
That part of the process of developing a software and in there. I think we're going to discover

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.900
um

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.460
the cause

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:48.180
While you were talking I thought of something else because I thought about clicky clicky clicky monkey monkey monkey

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.150
and then

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.990
what I find in the reports from some of the folks who

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.030
Who love the craft and again?

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:02.950
I love I I don't mean to make fun of anybody just just just pointing out where I disagree and and not just that I disagree

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.730
But why?

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:05.850
uh

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.690
There was a time when we didn't know what customers did didn't know how they used our software

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:13.770
We tried to find what we thought were the bugs that they would find but we were just guessing

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.700
We heard things like no customer would ever do that. But then they did

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.220
and

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.620
I still think today with some of these folks. I have seen examples of them

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.820
I talked about infatuation with the end-to-end automation, but they're infatuated with the edge case bug

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:36.900
And the difference today is I think edge cases given millions and millions of requests for users

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.220
The edge cases are much more likely to happen

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.420
But the difference is today is we have the data to go see we see say I run this

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.620
Weird made-up test I make and it finds a crash

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.160
Yay, I found a crash go fix this bug and in the old days someone may say

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.360
No, this will never happen in the real world

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:03.000
But what we can do now is we can go to our data and see is it's actually the cool thing is maybe we found something that

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.960
A hundred two hundred a thousand users have seen never been able to never been able to reproduce

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.920
And now at least we have a path to reproduce it. So that's better. I'm off on a tangent

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.640
I just don't get it. I I

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.560
I'm not particularly smart. I'm not particularly dumb either

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.560
But to me, it's just so obvious that we shouldn't have people who aren't the developers of the code writing automation

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:31.080
I don't get it like I i'm again thinking back on the the cognitive bias discussion

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.020
right, I'm

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.020
I am

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.020
I'm trying to puzzle through

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.020
On this one. I have not

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.940
As you know, i'm a data scientist I have not seen I do not have access to nicole's data

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.280
But I have no reason to believe

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.760
That she and her team are anything other than highly competent in this craft

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:02.120
Yeah, I am I am competent. She's yeah, she's not only smarter than I am. She has done this stuff for you

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:08.200
She knows exactly what she's doing. In fact, the methods of their research are documented heavily in the second half of that book

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.680
Yes, and i've gone through that

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.200
Let's assert then that that fact is true

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.960
Right when devs own the automation

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.890
There is a correlation

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:21.770
Okay

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.810
Now she did not say causation. She said correlation

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.470
which then generally means

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.430
either a high quality product

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.410
is causing

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.170
devs to own it

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:42.090
Or that devs owning it is causing the high quality product and actually both could be true. Yeah, and i'd say

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:46.090
She focused on devops metrics and their correlation, which is good

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:53.290
But I would say on teams where developers own all of the automation. I'm guessing they probably have some other

00:40:53.850 --> 00:41:00.170
Modern practices in place as well leading to that quality. I think my hunch is that practice

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:04.890
Is an indicator that they have a as we put in modern testing land a

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:12.010
Mature quality culture. Oh, I I completely agree, but let's talk about let's assume that they don't right? Let's say

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.890
You and I are going to start up a startup

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:19.130
Okay, and we're going to explicitly only hire

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:25.530
Like the old schooliest of the old school developers. Yeah, because they can't get jobs anywhere else. Sure

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.250
These these are ones that have been

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:34.810
For decades brainwashed that they are incapable of doing their own testing. Yep

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.530
And and they've been told that by their best friends the testers

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:42.650
And so when you're in my fictitious company, that's who we're gonna hire

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:47.770
We're gonna hire only those folks and we're gonna hire exactly zero testers

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:52.650
And we're gonna say you are accountable for for this automation

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.930
I do think we will eventually see

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:02.950
Uh, I can't predict the amount of time, but we will eventually see that quality dramatically improves

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.190
I believe so also and some of that via attrition when some of them just give up and quit

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:13.590
But but I get what you're talking about. They well, no, so I want to cover three cases here. Okay. Okay number one

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.050
Uh, they suddenly see the light and

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.730
And they build up a great test suite

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.850
two

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.690
Well, actually i'm just going to skip ahead to the thing I wanted to talk about so

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:32.890
Let's say these old schoolers, right? They they all gonna put in one or two unit tests

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:36.730
uh that are craptastic, okay, and

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.610
Uh

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:44.650
Then they have fulfilled the the our requirement on them. They own their automation suite

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:51.370
We we will put no requirements on the number of test cases. We will put no requirements on whether or not they pass or fail

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.010
We'll put no requirements

00:42:54.570 --> 00:43:00.970
Uh other than they own it and it is run regularly, uh daily maybe I don't know

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.370
It's my metaphor i'm making things up

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.610
now

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:08.970
We though will make one strong stance

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.600
right

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.880
your

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.880
your review

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.880
will be heavily weighted

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.400
off of

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.800
uh the customer experience or

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.800
Customer retention actually, there we go. Your review is weighted off of customer retention

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.930
That's it

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:36.730
It's a microsoft review heavy for uh thing i'll i'll just say they get a bonus target based on customer retention

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:43.770
Um, which I think is separate from the review, but I I get I get where you're going. Sure. Sure. I mean we can modify it i'm just tying

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:47.690
Customer retention to their incentive model. All right

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.450
I predict that with that incentive model change

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:54.810
those oldest of the old school

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.480
people

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.200
Will either leave to a company with a incentive model that they understand

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.240
Or will suddenly become kick ass automation. Yeah writers

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:14.920
What all let me actually give you a different ground there because as you know from dan pink people are motivated by

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.160
Buy enough money where it's not an issue. So they might not be the thing

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.880
purpose mastery autonomy

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:27.400
Yes, and what i've seen actually supports that model because i've coached i've taught

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.880
old school never written a test developers to write tests and

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:38.440
They've been told so long that testing is this dark art and yes, i'm talking about real testing

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:45.320
I've seen developers find bugs that that my biggest biggest opponents would never find they're good, but

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.150
they

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:52.710
They can learn to test and once they get over that hump because they've been told for so long that they can't test they believe it

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:57.670
Great and once you get them over that hump and you stop

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.550
Lying to them

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:06.790
And show them what real testing is and how to do it and how to evaluate risk and how to not just test the happy path

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:11.990
And again, I got somebody replied and said you can have developers test but the only test the happy path

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:18.710
I said jesus help them. That's the whole point help them because they haven't done it before they're not stupid

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:23.450
It just drives me crazy back to the original topic. But anyway, what i've seen is

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.290
They actually don't need that money. They need expectations

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.950
They need autonomy and mastery and a little bit of coaching and purpose. They know it's important

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:41.860
What i've seen is they get motivated just by them figuring out. They know what to do as you were talking one last thing I wanted to say is

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.500
When I see folks harp on the test automation pyramid

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.020
They look at it as a model. They have to fit

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:55.860
And they don't like it because they well, it's contextual. It may be different from my product and of course

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.260
But really the way to think of the model is

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.700
If your software is well architected and well testable

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.180
It'll nat your test automation will naturally look like that

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.490
So that's my point

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.610
Hey, if you're a tester and you're writing a much automated test just stop it

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.520
If you have to do it to stay employed do that but

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.320
I believe higher quality software comes from developer-owned test automation

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.040
Well, it's and it's not a belief

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:28.200
Well the belief the belief is the cause you know

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.960
It's correlated and it goes right back to the point we made towards the beginning of the podcast

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.920
We're not trying to preach some new idea. I am telling you this is happening

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:42.760
People have been doing this and it's working arguing with me that i'm wrong

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.960
Doesn't make these facts go away

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:50.860
I'm just I'm just highlighting some things that are happening

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.260
the only

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.500
point of doing that argument

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.300
honestly is to

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.400
Is to make an emotional plea

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.290
Yeah

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:08.810
Right. That's all right. And again, I I get where they're coming from these opponents. So I I

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.660
Again largely largely positive response on

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.140
the the first article i'll write a follow-up soon and

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:24.380
See if I can anger a different crowd of people which again, I don't i'm not doing the stuff to be controversial

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.020
I want people to understand what's going on around them

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:32.540
That's my soapbox for the day. Anything else before we call it a call it an afternoon there brent?

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.640
Yeah, there was something else. I wanted to say but no, we're good. You can save it for

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.740
134

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.440
134

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.800
That's our next episode, right? Oh, yeah, i'm like, yeah

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:52.040
So the what that reminds me is I was watching a listening to a radio show. I for some reason I thought you added

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.440
three days to january

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.720
134

00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:01.480
There's this new meme that I had to say I find appealing and and that is uh

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.120
to keep counting adding days to december such that

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:13.800
Uh, this is still considered part of 2020 because everyone wants 2020 to be over

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.640
Yep, i've seen that thank you everyone for listening for those who

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.620
Are you brent? I am I must be alan. We'll see you next time. Bye
