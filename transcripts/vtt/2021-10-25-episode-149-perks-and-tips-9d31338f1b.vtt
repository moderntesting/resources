WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Ice, ice baby.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.840
Now I have to think that I pissed off any part of my team who may listen to this, forget

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.840
to mention it.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.580
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.740
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.340
agile and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.050
Now, on with the show.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.090
AB Testing Podcast.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.090
That's where you are right now.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.450
Episode 149, edging up on the big 150, which we have absolutely no celebration plans for,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.650
but 150 is coming up.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.730
And I am Alan and I am here with the one and only, the B, the B side of the 45 that makes

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.850
up AB testing.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.850
Introduce yourself, Brent Jensen.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.260
Hi.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.060
Yeah, there we go.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.060
Bring in the energy.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.060
Bring in the energy.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.500
Did I ever tell you?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.020
Did I ever, I did something once that I don't know if I ever told you, there was one podcast

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.100
you came in with such low energy that I ended up taking the time to speed you up in editing

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.100
to make you move just a little bit faster to try and bring a little energy to your voice.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.220
Hey, everybody.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.260
So yeah, and hopefully that won't be today, but you know, it's just something I've done

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.240
before I do what I can to make this the best podcast in the world called AB testing, which

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.730
I think I think it's in the top five of all the podcasts named AB testing.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.570
Yeah, it's in the top five of all the podcasts named AB testing.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.570
So here we are.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.930
How's it going, Brent?

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.170
It's been an exciting week.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.680
And by exciting, I mean draining is all hell.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.080
Mine has been, and I want to get to that a little bit later, talking about some new things

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.240
for me happening at Unity and what it's doing to me.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.720
But yeah, you know, stuff happens.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.800
I'll just say like today.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.080
So my organization has rolled out.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080
No meeting Fridays.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.280
Oh, good, good, good, good.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880
That's something I want to talk about more later in the podcast.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.880
So how's that going?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.680
How many meetings did you have on no meeting Friday today?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.520
Oh, it's been back to back.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.870
It's funny because I talked to it's been something that's in place for a while and I talked

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.390
to my senior executive.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.950
So he and I have a quarterly one on one and he brought it up because he was I think he

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.110
was he uses me as a sounding board a lot of the time.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.380
I don't know how often he does this with everyone, but he knows because we have a long relationship.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:07.420
He knows that I will truthfully answer any question that is asked of me.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.340
Sometimes even the ones I'm like, please don't ask that question.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.820
I don't want to answer it.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.220
So he's like, hey, so how do you how do you feel about the no meeting Fridays?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.980
I'll call him Bob.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.620
Did he ask you this in a meeting on a Friday?

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.620
No.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.380
OK, it's just it was in a meeting.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.620
It was not on a Friday.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.620
All right.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.940
And I said I'm going to call him Bob to protect the innocent.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.780
But I said, Bob, if you wanted to punish the managers in your org, there are far more

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.510
direct and meaningful ways.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.670
Because what I found what I found was what he laughed and then he he asked, OK, why

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.670
am I saying that?

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.910
And I said, well, here's what's happening is every P.M.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.190
And their mother is now in order to honor this, is now trying to squeeze every second

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.110
of meeting time on Monday through Thursday.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.270
OK, let me know.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.590
No one's willing.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.950
No one's willing.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.490
No one's willing to counsel.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:17.200
And when I'm quadruple booked like they're getting upset when I am not

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200
choosing their meeting.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.840
Yeah.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.920
I'm like, all right, I'm going to I'm going to have this conversation because this is

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.760
actually something indirectly or as part of a group of things I wanted to talk about

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.840
today, which is what are the I will get into the whole idea on work perks.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.200
But this is interesting.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.000
Let's talk about A.B.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.880
testing for a second.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.600
I'll get back here.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.320
Not a tangent.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.240
This is a story like I know what I'm doing.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.310
It's a story.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.390
No, it's not a story like that.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.910
You seven, you child of the 70s.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.470
What happens if you take away all the testers on the team and don't give people a

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.270
framework or ideas on how to be successful with that chaos chaos?

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.550
So what happens if you go to no meeting Friday and you don't tell people how to

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.150
make it work?

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.110
It's what happens if you tell people to stop doing things and don't tell them

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.230
what you need.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.350
They they have new ways to create chaos and destruction.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.230
Yeah.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.870
So one thing I have been very fortunate and I have a packed schedule and I'm

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.230
someone who gets someone to manage my calendar for me and she freaks out over

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.950
my calendar.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.750
But despite that, and I'll tell you some reasons for why that is in a minute,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.070
99 plus percent of my meetings are 100 percent effective uses of my time.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.300
I don't have those fluff.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.140
I don't have meetings where people are like, this could have been an email.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.540
This could have been a Slack message.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.820
So I'm lucky there.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.060
And that's been true over my nearly five years at Unity now.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.180
So I but when you move to a four day week, you need to provide guidance on

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.980
how it works.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.660
Does it mean for 10 hour days?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.100
No.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.580
Does it mean if you want to know meeting Friday, does it mean you cram all the

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.740
meetings from the rest week into the, from Friday into one day?

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.220
Not necessarily.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.020
I think it is supposed to give you an opportunity to prioritize and look

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.540
at what's important.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.740
Unity gave all of the employees just some random Friday holidays over the

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.900
summer and people were pretty good about examining whether or not they

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.740
needed to cram five days of meetings into four days.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.660
If that's happening, there's just some more context and discussion happening.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.650
It's about optimizing the time because I brought up four day a week earlier.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.830
I thought this last summer, summer before last, I had some vacation that

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.270
was, well, to use one thing different.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.750
I discovered the hard way at Unity compared to Microsoft at Microsoft.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.670
You would always accrue vacation.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.030
And it was only at the end of the year when if you, you'll had a maximum

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.070
amount, you could carry over to the next year.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.030
What I discovered without paying attention is that unity, you actually

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.710
stop accruing vacation once you hit the max.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.430
So I noticed that I was no longer accruing vacation days.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.510
And because it was the early days of COVID, this was the summer before

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.270
last, I decided I would take every Friday off in the summer.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.990
And so I essentially assigned myself a four day work week and it worked.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.150
I was so much more energetic after that extra day off that I was able to

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.310
be as productive in 32 hours as I was in my normal 40 give or take,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.830
depending on the week so I could see how that could work.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.030
But it also meant that, you know, I had a few more meetings on those days,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:41.070
but I kind of was okay with it because I knew I'd have the extra rest time,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.590
but it can work, but if you're going to do it company wide or organization

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.670
wide, it would require some guidelines, a little bit of education, some

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.590
discussions, some retros, et cetera.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.070
The reason I want to talk about no meeting Fridays, four day work weeks

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.070
is because I'm opinionated about the topic.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.750
I was invited into a focus group with our HR department to talk

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.190
about workplace innovation.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.990
What could we do differently?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.820
What could we try and what should we consider?

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.740
What should we put on the plate to think about what could we do differently

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.700
to make unity an even better place to work?

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.700
And what's interesting is they gave us a spreadsheet, people to add their ideas.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.780
You're not going to be surprised.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.220
People added a lot of incremental things like maybe one more Friday off a month

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.490
or let's have some social events and little tweaks that are all really

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.890
good and things we should consider doing.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.850
Nothing's off the table.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.770
You want to have incremental things and big things.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.660
The things I put on the list were four day work weeks at the very

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.500
least a meeting, a meeting free Friday.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.350
Uh, things like, Oh, here's, here's one I put on there.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.430
Uh, vacation stipend.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.750
In addition to paid vacation, give everybody a thousand dollars worth of

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.510
reimbursable money to use on a vacation to make them actually do a

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.550
vacation away from their hometown, you know, pay for them to get away.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.820
Unity has moved away.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.140
Another one is unity has moved away from a fully remote work, even though

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.580
actually with my new org, we'll just talk about in a bit about 16% of my

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.340
org is currently fully remote and I would hire more fully remote people.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.140
But we're putting a pause on that for now.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.980
I think we go back.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.300
I think we should go back to that.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.100
Uh, a lot of things about transparency, but anyway, big things.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.940
I wanted to talk about it and like just before we pressed record, Brent and

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.140
now we're talking about like other perks we get and unity is really good.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.740
For example, on just things we get today on health benefit, like health,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.580
not just, not just, um, healthcare or insurance, but we get enough money

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.540
to cover my gym membership for the entire year, even though I took a few

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.860
months off because you know, a pandemic, but also to buy a new, a new

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.740
backpack, sleeping bag, a tent, all covered.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.780
So that's pretty cool too.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.660
Um, but what I'm curious, uh, we don't have to do like a macho comparison

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.940
contest between Microsoft and unity or other companies, but I'm just kind of

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.980
curious, either what something Microsoft offers or something you've thought of.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.020
What are some other cool, this would be great one to pop it on the Slack channel.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.580
One of the three.slack.com go to modern testing.org, get an invitation.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:32.220
I'm curious what other cool ideas companies are doing to, you know,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.220
perks that are, they make it fun.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.180
Another one I thought of like just, uh, peer bonuses, uh, which is something

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.540
that Google has done in the past.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.420
I don't know if still do it now, but just some things to help reward people

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.020
and give people that little attaboy, which is important and little

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.300
things like a hundred dollars, $200, those things like that.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.260
Anyway, I am going a mile a minute and I'll slow my voice down later.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.980
But does that tickle any, any bells for you?

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.500
That's a mixed metaphor, but go for it.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.100
Yeah.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.380
So we have, we have a perks thing as well.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.820
Like, uh, it just changed.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.540
Uh, it used to be.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:16.010
So one of the benefits of Microsoft was, um, uh, an annual

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.490
subscription to the pro club gym.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:27.010
And for those not anywhere near the Washington area, uh, pro club, I

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.890
would say by far is probably literally where the pros hang out back in the day.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.290
And when I worked at Microsoft and I used to go to the pro club, I would see

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.330
sonics there every morning, the sonics were a basketball team that used to

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.930
exist in Seattle before it, before, um, it got screwed up and they went to Oklahoma.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:45.650
Anyway, go on.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.450
Super Sonic.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.890
Uh, speaking of which, you, you paying attention at all to the Kraken.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.050
Oh yeah.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.050
Oh yeah.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.410
All right.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.290
All right.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.890
I am, I am all in on the Kraken.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.730
Nice.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.530
Yeah.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.250
I started well, Kraken season started right when the mariner season ended.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.770
So that was handy for me.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.170
Yeah.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.610
Um, overlapping soccer.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.170
I'm a big sounders fan, so they get my ultimate attention, but I am going to be.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.970
And again, I don't have cable TV.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.850
So when they're on a channel, I can stream.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:23.370
I will watch the Kraken regularly on the reg as they say, but nobody says that.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.050
Anyway, go on.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.490
No one does say that.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:37.540
So the, so the pro club, I would, I w I would guess is probably by far the best gym

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.620
in the Pacific Northwest of hands down.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.900
It is, it is the lap of luxury gym.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:50.220
You just cannot imagine the sheer size of this place and how nice it is and how

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.380
well up kept it as I, I cannot explain it.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.940
I can't either.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.860
But then Microsoft sort of changed it, changed the policy to say, okay, we

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:07.260
have options now we can, we can pick the pro club or we can do some amount of

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:14.100
money and it was less than the value of the pro club annually, but you could

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.260
do some amount of money for anything that you want, as long as you could

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.820
justify that it was for like physical fitness type of thing.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.380
So, uh, sounds pretty similar.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.260
Yeah.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.820
You could, like, you could use it to, to what is that cool bike that everyone's

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.100
getting, I don't have a search with a P the, does it matter?

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.740
It doesn't matter.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.700
I got to let it go.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:39.900
Yeah.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.900
The, so there's a lot of like exercise services.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.060
People are buying, you know, a year at a time they were buying like little,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.300
little in-house equipment, things like that.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.460
Well, they've not been able to do that.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.300
Well, they've now expanded it.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.500
So it's now literally, you talked about perks.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:03.660
It's literally called perks and it's still less than the total for pro club,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.820
but they grew it.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.380
It's, it's got a larger budget on a per employee basis and it's

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.700
also a lot more flexible.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.940
Um, but, but that's just, that's just cash to take care of yourself.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.260
What I'm talking about perks like massage, messieurs at work or.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.300
Dinner is sent to your house at once a week or like, what are companies doing?

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:32.240
Well, so my, my company, at least my organization, it's not Microsoft,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.480
but the organization has done things like that.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.610
They will, will use their morale budget, uh, and disperse it through employees.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:46.650
Like last year, I got a really nice gift basket from Harry and David's.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.170
Um, I've bought some board games and things like that.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:50.410
Right.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.050
I'm talking about like regular perks for recruiting or kind of things that make a

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.010
company unique place to work.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.490
Yeah.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.050
There's nothing like there's nothing to do anything at Microsoft, but you truly do.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:01.290
Yeah.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.850
Are you one of those Microsoft people who never talks to anyone outside

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.290
of Microsoft except for like me?

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.210
Yeah.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.570
Sadly, last couple of months.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.610
That's probably that's yeah.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.690
So I'm no, that literally is true.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.410
I would guess among the three, there's some ideas.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.370
So I'm going to go with you.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.410
I've been racking my brain trying to think outside of the box.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.090
I really like this idea of vacation stipend.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:28.290
Uh, yeah, I like, I like the vacation stipend or maybe we buy some, maybe we buy

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:33.770
like a handful of condos and Hawaii or some other places and, and give people

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.490
vacation, you know, cheap vacation rental.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.190
Uh, yeah, actually interesting.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:44.790
So a corporate timeshare that, that might be, now you're getting outside the box with me.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:50.710
I really like, I really liked the peer thing that Google does.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.950
I adore that.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.310
I've been actually thinking about, could I get away for years?

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.950
I've been thinking about, could I get away with doing that?

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.750
Like I have my own budget.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:04.710
I can segment it and say, all right, I'll let my team own 50% of it.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:12.740
But I've kind of, if that goes sideways, I could see all sorts of really

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.250
troubling things that I would then have to resolve.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.050
You just keep an eye on those.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.930
And like, um, I remember Whitaker telling me a story, somebody on his team did

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.610
something massively cool and 27 people or something, which I'm sure is

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.570
exaggerated knowing Whitaker, but a whole bunch of people gave him a peer bonus.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.810
So his boss and HR go, Hey, what's going on?

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.810
Said, no, he just did this.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:33.650
They go, okay, cool.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:39.610
We don't have peer bonuses directly, but I do have a pretty free pool of

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.210
spot bonuses that I use.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.770
I use myself, but now my team is used to me enough.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.730
They go, Hey, I think so-and-so should get a spot bonus.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.530
I go, Hey, I'll take care of that.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.770
So that's the way we sort of, it's sort of facilitated spot bonus.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.460
Yeah, actually.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:03.420
And I know, I know Salesforce, uh, they don't have a regular bonus.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.300
They only have spot bonus.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:05.780
Yeah.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.660
It's the same here.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.540
Only, only, uh, director pluses have a regular bonus and it's

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:16.420
actually tied directly to company, uh, company revenue and performance, but

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.860
everyone else, I try and make liberal use of my spot bonus budget.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.670
So looking for more ideas on perks.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.230
Uh, that was one of the things I wanted to talk about.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.990
I told you my cool ideas.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:35.350
We should talk about, did we talk, I know we talked offline about my new,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.940
uh, title, which actually I've got a letter from HR announcing it.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.020
And, but it hasn't been announced internally.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.220
So I probably will, I'll just leave it at that and you can use your guesses.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.180
But I do have a much bigger organization now, which I don't believe we've talked

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.020
about on the podcast might be worth talking about that for two reasons.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.140
One is the scope of what we cover and the mission of that team.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.630
And the other one is challenges that come when you add 80 people to your

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.350
organization in one fell swoop.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.830
Hey, is that challenging?

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.530
Listen 10 minutes longer and find out.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:17.810
All right.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.330
There's the in app CH the in episode cliffhanger.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:28.010
So let's talk about the first part of that, which is, which was that, uh,

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.770
Oh, the scope.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.890
So I think I've mentioned on the podcast before, um, oh boy, a couple,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.490
we had two reorgs happen at once.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.130
One took a little longer to happen.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.010
One was actually pretty quick.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.050
So we've done two things with his latest reorg.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.860
One is easy.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.420
We've, uh, unity up until a week ago had two different documentation

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.380
orgs for customer facing documentation.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:58.890
There was my org had, um, a handful of people, 12, 15, who wrote the

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:04.450
documentation for all of our customers who use services, things like ads,

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:09.170
analytics, uh, some of our new unity gaming services features, uh, cloud

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.370
save, uh, et cetera.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.570
Uh, we had that team plus another documentation team focused on just

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.090
basically everything else editor engine, some of the verticals we support,

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:19.890
things like that.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:20.610
Okay.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.490
We decided it made sense to merge those into one org and just have

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.330
one documentation or it's just kind of a no brainer.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.330
So we merged those other documentation folks into my team.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.610
Everybody's working together.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.650
We're already finding some good areas for alignment.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.770
Uh, with that part of the reorg, we knew it was going on for a while.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.730
So we were able to get people talking at things set up.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.970
So that's stage one part one.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.170
It's not even a part one, part two, part a part B, they both

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.050
happen at the same time.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.130
But anyway, I now manage documentation for all of

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.650
unity's external documentation.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:59.050
So if you are a unity user and you go, man, I can't figure out how to use

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.750
this thing because the documentation is whack, you can message me and

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.230
I'll, I'll make sure it gets fixed.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.320
Not on Twitter.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.240
Uh, anyway, hopefully I don't open up a flood gate right there, but I think

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.040
Michael, our engineering, I tell our engineering team that we are a solid B.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.600
We're a B engineering team.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.440
We have, it's good.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.160
It's a 3.0.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.840
It's awesome.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.880
We need to be a 4.0.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.960
So we're going to work.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.120
We have some work to do there.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.080
Uh, and again, documentation answers the question.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.840
What does a user need in order to be successful with this feature or product?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.600
And we give you a solid 80, 80 to 88% of that.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.240
We need to get to the high nineties.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:51.580
The other thing that happened was we had a sister organization, a brother

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:58.260
organization, a peer organization to my org, which focuses on service

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.580
infrastructure, CI CD for those systems, et cetera.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.780
There's a peer organization at unity that did that handles all of the,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.100
this will bring you way back to the 2000s Brent, the same infrastructure,

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.140
CI CD deployment, test farms, et cetera, for our desktop software.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.750
Okay.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.270
Yeah.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.590
So that team is now part of my organization as well.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.950
Well, that's good.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.110
And it makes sense because both teams have CI CD, both teams do testing.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.710
Both teams.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.910
It's a lot of overlap.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.390
It's good.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.430
We're going to get everything working together, but it's kind of fun

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.020
because there, some of the challenges they still have are some of the

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:42.140
problems that I remember solving, or at least being a part of solving in the

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:47.100
past, things like test selection, test prioritization, machine usage.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.820
We actually have some of our own lab slash data centers we use to do a build

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:57.530
and test in, we leverage, uh, external services and vendors.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.330
It's a whole bunch of cool, fun stuff.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.490
So many opportunities to learn.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.050
Fun, lots of new stuff.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:04.730
That's old stuff.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:05.850
Yeah.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.290
I mean, it's a world.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.410
I mean, the it's a world you used to know.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.450
It is, it is.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:17.010
But one thing I'm realizing is on one hand, they're very different, but on the

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:22.210
other hand, data centers and cloud infra aren't really that different.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.900
If you think about the transition, we went from machines full of labs to shoving

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.460
those machines into a data center, to calling that data center, the cloud.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.080
Yeah.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.800
I'm oversimplifying.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.160
Just send your hate mail to me.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.920
No, it's not, it's not a bad simplification.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.660
Not at all.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.100
Yeah.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.540
So I have those pluses, a few of the things in my org, just for completeness.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.620
Someone asked me to draw it out once and I should do that.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.380
So I have a documentation, all of the support.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.020
So for everybody building stuff and deploying stuff, all of that stuff.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:04.100
Also localization is in my org because that overlaps deeply with documentation

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.420
as well as the engineering system, because we do things like make sure we can

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.780
make sure all the things we build, we can do pseudo look builds for pseudo

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.300
look for those aren't in, we haven't had to deal with that before.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.780
It's, it's fake localizing something via some regex pattern to make

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.860
sure your localization process works and to make sure your prost, your,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.620
your are localizable.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.180
Laura Mipsum.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.580
Yes.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.860
Laura Mipsum.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.780
And, uh, we have, of course, I've mentioned a couple episodes ago,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:39.780
Melissa Eden manages a team doing quality coaching across 500 plus engineers,

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.860
plus she just manages special projects.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.300
And then I have, uh, we've centralized a program management for my overall

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.860
org under me and remember Brent program management to me and the rest of the

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.340
industry is different than what they call program managers at Microsoft.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:02.860
These are people that focus on the how and the when of what we build a product

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:08.770
or program, a lot of times at Microsoft it's the why and the what I think the

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.610
TPM has done technical program management has done.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.250
If you look at it as the, the, uh, the how and the when is very much an

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.210
engineering aspect.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.250
So that's in my org as well.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.250
We drive, so we can drive our engineering practices across the rest of our org.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.810
There is, I don't know if I've ever told you my team's mission.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:32.370
So I use this mission statement for my old team on cloud infra and my new

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.930
team seems okay with it unchanged.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.300
And it may ring a bell.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.900
Uh, there may be some copyright infringement here.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.020
Oh boy.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.100
Accelerate the success of engineering teams at unity in delivering high

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.540
value products and services that our customers love.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.300
Yeah.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.740
That doesn't sound familiar at all.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.540
That shouldn't matter.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.100
It's O O Ridge.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.540
Ice ice baby.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.580
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.980
Now I have to think that I, that I pissed off any part of my team who may

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.620
listen to this, forget to mention it.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.660
So one thing I should mention is so maybe it goes right into my next topic,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:16.260
which is my new team is of those 80 people I added almost all of them are

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.750
in Europe, a few, I have a few more in Montreal, but I've added 50 plus in

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:29.390
Denmark and, uh, another 20 in Brighton, England, and then a few sprinkled in

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.070
Montreal and around the rest of the world.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:32.270
Nice.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:39.460
So you're doing a good job on, on making sure you're hiring people in, into nice

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.900
places to, to spend, uh, uh, expense budget on to fly out.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:45.100
Right.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:45.900
Here's the deal.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.420
Um, for some reason, I don't think it's, I don't know if it's been

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:53.700
because they think we won't go out in the sun and enjoy ourselves and work more,

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.740
but unity is highly concentrated in.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.620
All say Northern locales.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:06.180
We do have a San Francisco office, but Copenhagen, Finland, England, Seattle,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.260
we, we air on the side of North.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.820
We don't have Costa Rica, Hawaii, New Zealand.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.780
So you need to create a, like a, a, a sub in like, like, a, like, a, like,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.060
a sub in like Cancun maybe, maybe.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:29.260
Uh, so I do have to say that I have had a lot of people in the new work or who are

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.060
a part of the, the, uh, what would I call it?

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.860
The, my new peeps, the new people in the org have not only have they reached out to

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.140
chat to me, which has been great.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.980
Cause I actually, I can be somewhat proactive.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.260
I mean, I've already, I have regular one-on-ones with my new directs challenge.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.420
Number one, we can talk about, we can go in in these, you want

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.740
challenge number one, 15 direct reports right now.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.780
I can talk about how I'm dealing with that.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.700
Not horrible, not great.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:01.100
Challenge number two already accomplished is I have now set up not recurring yet,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.260
but at least I have some meetings on the calendar with all of my skip level

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.500
managers so I can meet with all the leads I haven't talked with before.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.260
But I've been pleasantly surprised that I've already had a good handful of

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.420
people reach out to me and say, Hey, we should chat.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.380
And inevitably when I chat with them, they've already done an appropriate

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.900
amount of internet stalking.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.420
I had talked to a person this morning who said, Hey, I listened to your podcast,

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.540
got halfway through and I thought, no, I'm going to wait until I talk to you.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.820
And then I'm going to go back and listen so I can get to know you better.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.540
And what I'm finding is other people have either read staff, listen to podcasts,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.180
see what I've come, see where I've come from.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.700
A lot of alignment.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.220
They go, Hey, I like the way you think.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.380
And I said, I don't really think myself.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.940
I just highlight what I already see, which I realized is a lot of my management style.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.100
So anyway, challenge number one, 15 direct reports, challenge number two time zone.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.100
So I start my day at six 30.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.260
I am pushing hard to not start at six.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.750
As you can imagine with Denmark being nine hours ahead.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.600
So we have eight hours ahead in England, nine hours ahead in Denmark

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.240
and 10 hours ahead in Finland.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.800
My six 30 to nine 30 years.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.960
So it's jam packed every morning.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.000
Six 30 to nine 30 every day.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.980
And to make matters worse, I have a pre-plan.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.140
I'm taking two days off to go backpacking next week.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.740
So stuff's going to get crammed in a little bit.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.420
The week after is all sorts of triple booking.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:30.180
But I have a, I have an EA who will take care of figuring all that out.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.860
But I do have calendar jam.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:32.940
It's not,

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.460
Did you say, I'm sorry, did you say you're working six 30 to nine 30?

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.820
Well, no, I'm working, I started at six 30, but my meeting,

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.820
I usually get some breaks, some gaps beginning about nine 30,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.500
six 30 to nine 30 every morning is every morning.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.260
OK, not six 30 a.m. to nine 30 at night.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.820
No, the good news is for those of you going, hey, dude, is

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.740
I do stop every day at three 30 or earlier.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:03.270
Oh, so you're still managing to work a a normalish day.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:03.910
Normalish.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.550
It's a little more than eight hours a day.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.550
But I also practice work life blend.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.390
Like if I have an hour break, I'm off taking the dog a walk.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.710
If I have an hour and a half break, I'm running off to the gym

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:17.150
where someone can completely disregard mask rules and just be a dick.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.750
But that's a different story.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.390
But I blend that time versus work a solid day.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.710
It's the new way of working from home.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.590
So I have a number of reports and size of team to expand to.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.550
And the challenges are just I guess I mentioned a little bit last time

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.310
how to make a connection with everyone.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.510
I am going to I believe it or not, I think I am this close

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.750
to getting approval from our people that control these things

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:48.390
to be able to go to Copenhagen for a week because in just adding 50 people there,

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.670
that I think the best thing I can do is just go spend a week there

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.900
and hang out with people.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.100
Yeah, I think in in bringing other

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.100
other of your directs along with you would be good, too.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.580
Yeah, it's tough to get right now.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.780
It's tough to get permission.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.780
I think at this stage, I'll just go this time.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.220
I think it to give them all a chance to either learn to trust me a little bit

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.420
or learn to hate me, but they won't be in the middle, at least.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.160
At least I'll know where I stand.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.680
Yeah, ambiguity is the worst.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.700
I agree with that.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.500
One of the things I was so the one thing that was the worst for me.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.740
So there was years ago where I was the dotted line manager

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:35.400
of a person in in Hyderabad, which is nearly literally,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.560
you know, one half a day apart.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.550
And that was difficult.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.150
That was difficult because we we had to trade off

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:55.630
between. So what we did is we we every week we swapped between

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.430
morning or evening, morning or evening.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.630
And I'm generally an early bird.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.230
I think you are as well.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.110
That's why we did the podcast originally at eight in the morning,

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.680
eight in the morning.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.760
So when it was my turn to stay up late,

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.820
it was torturous.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.740
There were times I'm like, it is so past my bedtime.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.820
I'm just going to say, uh huh.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.540
Sure. Uh huh. Sure. Sure.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.940
Yeah. Interesting.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.580
Because I even find just because of Zoom fatigue,

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.500
if I have a three o'clock one on one, you don't get a good one on one for me.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.220
I try and limit those and just try and do meetings where I can listen

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.380
in late afternoon as much as I can because I get fried.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.340
Yeah, I I've learned that as well.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.860
Like I and there's actually some science on this one

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.660
that morning meetings are better.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.500
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.380
And what I find that my happiness

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.940
is directly correlated to how many hours before I leave work

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.170
consistently do I have freeze.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:19.470
Right. And so I can spend I can spend the last few hours before I leave,

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:25.870
you know, closing out all the or many of the things that I couldn't close out

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:27.790
because I was in meetings all day and day long.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:32.040
Yep. And so ending the day with

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.440
with, you know, the little checks in the little box.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.940
Oh, that feels so much better.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.260
It does. It does.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:47.260
So I want to I want to actually get to the re emphasize and put it very clearly

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.540
before a bit. So what advice do you have for me?

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.700
I mean, you know, if you've done, I don't think you've done this

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.180
particular challenge before, but you've been around leadership enough.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.500
So I have I guess the biggest one, they just addressed one, which is

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:06.300
what tips do you have for when you your team in one

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.180
in a moment, in a moment in time adds 80 people?

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.780
What advice would you have for me?

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:21.100
I don't I don't know that I so I have I have regular advice or it's things

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.700
I think we've talked about before.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.020
And right. The absolute key thing.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.060
I'll fall back to what is what is it?

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.140
The cliche storming, forming Norman, norming.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.260
Right. That's that's what you need to do.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:42.830
You need to very rapidly lay down principles that identify

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.190
or that construct an intrinsic team identity.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.620
Like what is your the identity for your organization?

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:58.740
You like here, I'm just sharing things mostly for the audience

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.340
because you do this naturally very well.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.000
Right. You know, you're going to need rallying cries.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.320
You know, you're going to need to set some principles in place.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.980
You know, you're going to need to create, create freedom,

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:20.800
create engagement, but get people bought into the identity

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.770
that is associated with your missions.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:29.110
When you go and you talk to those folks, I'm thinking through

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:32.430
several things that you've done here at Microsoft.

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:36.470
Like some of my favorite things that you did when you were running.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.670
What the hell was that thing?

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.670
Engineering excellence.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:46.230
No. So there was a period of time where you're running like a Q tech.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:50.430
The quality, the quality and testing experts community.

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.350
Yeah. Q tech. That was the name of it.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.190
I was like, it was similar to tag, except it was after you.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.640
It was funded. Right.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.640
So Q tech was interesting.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.200
Like my favorite ones that you came in with were ones where

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.920
you just had questions. That was the only agenda.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.630
You had questions and then it ended up.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.830
And then you had an exercise where people could sort of come in and

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.110
and add value, add additional context.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:29.160
And people walked out with the right identity connections.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.120
And the words you didn't mention there, that's something that I believe

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.280
in strongly, which we have talked about before.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.170
It was community. Yeah. Community.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.950
I'm trying to generate community.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.790
Yeah. Community.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.470
I think that's actually it.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.310
Right. You need to generate community

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:54.070
between your your future staff and that the community needs to

00:35:54.230 --> 00:36:00.550
be aligned to write a an employee, a mutually beneficial identity

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:07.160
and the identity and what I mean by mutually both both the employee

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.390
and the missions you're trying to take on. Right.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:16.030
You want you want to generate energy with these folks, have them feel like,

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.590
OK, they're here for the right reasons.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.630
They they can actively contribute

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.730
and that that your mission is important.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.010
Yeah. Well, I find it again.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.710
You're right. I do find purpose important and

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:38.590
being able to tie your work to a purpose is important,

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.430
which goes into I've had a couple of talks with the teams.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.710
I did two hours of one for your I end up.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:50.230
One worth mentioning is given non-overlap between West Coast,

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.630
especially in Europe, for a lot of my bigger meetings and done this before.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.790
I just fully embraced it now.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:58.950
I do a Europe and an America's version of a lot of my meetings.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.700
I just did the meeting twice.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.020
Well, sure. And that that makes sense. Right.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.180
The other thing you can do to be fair is do the meeting.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.740
Do the meeting once, record it and then switch.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.420
So I switch between the audience.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.300
So last week, right after the rework, I did two full hours of AMAs,

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.700
one for Europe, one for America's.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.780
And as I'm as you can tell from my reading between the lines,

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.140
my is a shift in my work. My org is mostly European now.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.380
Great questions, a great way to learn to begin to earn some trust on the team.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.700
And then something I've done for a while is that every other week I do

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.220
an all hands and don't call it an all hands.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.580
I just call it a just a team biweekly.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:43.330
I half hour of just whatever I think is relevant.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:47.980
So the goal behind this is I led with for this first one with everybody.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:52.300
There is the reason behind this meeting is and you can probably relate to this.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.740
I've been in jobs in my life and against all Microsoft to compare with,

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.940
where I didn't know what was going on.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.900
Nobody told me why decisions were being made. I knew nothing.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.860
It was hard to do good work because I could not get purpose from my work.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.060
I didn't know why what I was doing was important.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.700
And then other times when I had some more transparency,

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.060
I enjoyed my work more and because I enjoyed it more, I did better work.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.660
So the purpose beyond this meeting that I've done for a while is transparency.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.020
And the agenda is easy.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:30.100
I think about what are the big things that going on with my day today

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.740
that the rest of my organization may not know about.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.540
And we talk about that.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.620
And it's everything from sometimes it's planning.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.780
It's how we do promos, how we do budget, things that your frontline manager,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.580
frontline IC may not know about, just so nothing's hidden.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.260
Something I've thought about, one of the perks I recommend going back

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.740
to the previous topic is more open meetings.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.740
A lot of people at Unity have closed calendars.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.340
You can't see what's on them.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:00.340
My calendar is wide open, but I think I want to invite people to not one on ones,

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.500
of course, but there's a meeting.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.900
I think most of my meetings, I can actually invite people

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.180
if they want to come in and listen, I can make that an optional thing they can do.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.060
But back on the other subject is we just talked about the culture I want to have,

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.140
which is something I mentioned before.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.380
It's something I they get now or they're getting with the new folks

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.180
transparency, accountability and psychological safety.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.780
He went deep into those.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.380
But one bit of culture shock I got, which is interesting

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.620
from some of the people is a very interesting and I think OK,

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.500
culture shock to have is their reactions to their first week in the org has been.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.580
Oh, my God, this is so transparent.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.850
I'm not used to this, which I will take.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:48.360
Yeah, I view that as a positive.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.500
Yeah, I'm going to take that one for good.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.020
There is such a thing as over transparent.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:01.390
But in this case, like the way you tell the story, I don't want the talk.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:08.070
You know, whenever I join a first like I have a I have my first speech.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.660
Whenever I join a team or whenever I get a new hire,

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:22.380
like the the the very first speech I have with them is that I just I'm just transparent.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:28.060
I'm like, look, I am going to do everything I can in my power.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.740
I'm telling you in words right now, but I'm going to tell you

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.020
that my actions will follow up.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:39.740
I am going to work hard to earn your trust.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:48.810
I the I have found that gaining the trust of my organization

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:57.620
repeatedly is the path towards greatness.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.020
Yes, yes, yes. And I talked about this is this is Lynch.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.060
He only has five dysfunctions of a team without trust.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.340
You can't have conflict.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.220
And what I call conflict is the ability to drive for alignment,

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.860
the ability to disagree without trust.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.060
You can't have a meaningful, meaningful decision making.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:18.180
And without that, you can't have accountability or you can't have buy in

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.060
because people aren't bought in because they don't feel like their voice has been heard.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.380
Without that, you can't people aren't going to feel accountable.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.420
And if people don't feel accountable, you're not going to get results.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:30.180
So, yeah, one gazillion percent degree.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.660
And you'll you'll I kind of disagree with the last one.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.860
You'll get results.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.220
Right.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.180
Okay. All right.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.220
But it is a man.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.100
So I'll tell them I'll tell them why.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.060
So you and I have talked about this many a times around,

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.820
you know, where ideas come from and the difficulties of knowledge work.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:56.980
Right. But if you don't have earned if you haven't earned their trust, right,

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:02.100
as the as a leader, and in your case, I say it was even worse, right?

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.380
Essentially, you're a senior executive at Uniti now.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.540
And as as that, if you haven't earned the trust of your folks

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:17.460
and you need to derive results at the end of the day, certain decisions you may or may not

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.340
have to make. I did like I know unity is a little unique.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:28.390
But if decisions are made in an organization doesn't have trust,

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:36.150
then you can't rely on the intelligence of the hundreds of people underneath you

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:43.350
to come to you when it's necessary to inform you that your idea is stupid as hell.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:46.870
Right. You don't have with because you need psychological safety.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:51.110
This is why transparency and accountability and psychological safety to me go together.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.830
And I told them flat out. I said, I can tell you all day

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.710
that I'm a good guy and you should trust me.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:00.230
But you totally shouldn't because you don't know me yet.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.750
So here's here's the walk. Here's the here's the talk.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:09.110
I want to walk and we're just going to have to practice this until we learn to trust each other.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.390
We'll get there. But, you know, everybody's going to get there at their own pace.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.990
That's all I can do for now. And then and in the meantime,

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:20.070
walk the talk and slowly get people on board.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.910
Some people are there already. Some people will take months and that's

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.470
or maybe even longer. That's fine. That's my job.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:33.140
Yeah. The the thing for me. So I don't ever tell my staff this.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.660
Right. I view it as it's my job to earn their trust.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:43.820
And what I don't tell them is they have my trust immediately

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.810
because I think that is the way to to lead by example.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:54.470
Right. And so for me is trust is immediately granted.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:59.830
Until repeatedly shown it's not dessert.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:05.990
Yeah. Right. But I tell my employees I want them to treat me exactly the opposite.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:12.470
I am the worst evil pointy haired manager until I prove otherwise.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:19.110
Yeah. The overlap to that is I know I've mentioned on the podcast that Maxwell's

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.670
five levels of leadership. I'm going into the first two.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:25.270
First, you're put in a position of leadership. And that's what I've been given with this

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:30.710
new org. But then I need to get people to give me permission to lead them.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.440
And that's really just trust. And that's what I'm working on right now.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.620
100% truth. Maybe 110.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:44.120
Oh, but as a data scientist, you know, that's not actually possible. 110%.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.660
You can have things be more than 100%.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.700
But as a human, I can only give you 100%.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.470
No.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.500
I only have 100% to give.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.780
It depends on if it's relative.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.900
And on this episode of the Spinal Tap version of A-B testing.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:11.340
But my effort goes to 11. All right. So, okay.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:16.300
This will be an ongoing, probably not every episode, just, and you're welcome.

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:21.980
But interesting challenge where I'm at. And I'm excited to see where it goes.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.540
And for those of you in my new org, listening to me babble on here for the first time,

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:33.820
I apologize and I'm sorry, and we'll talk more. And you can tell me all the things that you don't

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.660
believe or don't like us totally fine. Or you don't have to listen. I don't make people listen.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.060
Yeah. I kind of prefer when my staff doesn't listen.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.980
I know. It kind of freaks me out when people I know listen to the podcast.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:52.170
Yeah. For me, it's easy. Oh, sorry.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:56.090
Some people say, Hey, I listened to episode 146. What was that about? I said,

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.050
I don't remember whatever was on my mind.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.100
Yeah. Yeah. All right, dude. I got to go to a meeting.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.260
Yeah. I got to go too. Thanks for the time. Once again,

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:10.540
episode 149. The next one's the big 150. I'm Alan.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.460
I'm Brett. We'll see you later.
