WEBVTT

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.080
Good morning, everybody. Hello. I'm Alan. I'm Brent.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.080
And guess what? It's a detest.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.880
Episode number 35.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.400
You know, I've been in this room for a few minutes.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.560
I just noticed that Brent has no facial hair on his face.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.080
Yeah, I'm going back and forth between trying to decide,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.920
do I want to look younger and fatter or less fat and older?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.180
Not touching that with a 10 foot pole.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.660
Hey, so not only are we here recording at our normal time of 8 a.m.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.780
Good morning.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.540
But it's a daylight saving time weekend.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.020
Yeah, that was fun.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.220
And the weird thing is, for the first time in as long as I couldn't remember,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.580
it snuck up. I didn't know it happened.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.540
I thought my clocks were wrong.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.780
I thought there was like an AT&T bug for a while.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.900
I got up yesterday morning getting ready to go do some homework.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.140
And then I looked first thing I do is I looked at my phone and I said,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.780
wait a minute, why does my phone say it's an hour later?

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.850
First off going into, oh my God, my phone's broken.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.560
Then even worse.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.960
Oh, wait, I may have just lost an hour.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.960
Yeah. So which caused some frustration because my son had to be at baseball

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.320
practice and deep in the bowels of Seattle early that day.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.400
And I just lost an hour in prepping.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.200
Oh, well. Oh, well.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.440
So it's early.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.320
I'm a little tired, but I think I'm OK.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.240
But it reminded me of a story I wanted to tell.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.320
Actually, a story I don't think I've told before on the podcast.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.360
What's that? Whoa.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.680
There was a time

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.880
must have been around right around the turn of the century.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.680
It's great we can say that now, right?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.080
Right around the turn of the century when I had just joined the Windows CE team

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.300
and was doing some kernel and driver testing.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.970
And but I was also in this test architect role and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.770
one of the the role is still pretty new.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.690
I didn't know what it was, but it was a really weird spot in the product cycle

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.410
where it was kind of almost too late to jump in and do like anything major.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.810
But there was a bunch of work needed to get done.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.370
So the first one of the first things I did was sort of get an overview of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.770
what's getting done on the team, what's not getting done,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.490
what are the plans, try and get an idea of what was happening with the product.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.960
And one of those meetings, I found out that there was this

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.600
all this work for the Shell and Windows Explorer on this is on Windows

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.000
CE 4 3 3.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.820
One of those versions back there.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.730
Probably three.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.050
He said this work is all planned, but there's no developers for it.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.090
We're not going to do it.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.450
I looked at it and I said it was like five features and 20 bugs.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.770
I love fixing bugs.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.010
It to me, it's a very fine line between that investigation of testing

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.490
and figuring out, oh, that's all the problem is.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.930
I can fix that. I'll go ahead and do it.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.570
So that's so for about three months, I was a developer.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.210
I was the shell developer for Windows CE.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.850
Did you do all five features?

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.090
I did. And the reason the story is actually relevant,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.610
despite your wonders about that, is that one of the features that I wrote

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.210
was implementing a DST check, Daylight Saving Time Check, on Windows CE,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.690
making sure that the clock changed at the right time.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.540
When is the clock supposed to change?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.650
Ah, it depends on the time zone.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.290
I don't want to dive deep into the implementation, but the point is

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.910
I know because of the effort I put into getting this right

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.390
and in making it right for everyone, that Daylight Saving Time

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.230
is a place that's just ripe for finding bugs.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.950
Absolutely.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.430
One of the things I learned as a developer was when you were,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.030
and maybe some developers don't make this connection, but when I'm

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.110
maybe they're really proud of the cleverness,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.390
they got it to finally work, at least on their machine.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.670
But for me, I finished that and I thought, this is probably never going to work.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.030
So I immediately, this will tie in some other topics today,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.630
I immediately began testing it.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.790
I tried different time zones and sending timers.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.310
And in addition to looking at the time zone

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.750
and when the time is supposed to change, what day and date, sorry,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.100
what date and time, there's also two different paths

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.380
where that update can happen.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.620
When your machine's on, like it happens to be running when that happens.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.020
And then when it's off and you boot into the new time zone. Right.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.300
So I tested the heck out of that thing.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.980
I'm not going to say the code was bug free.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.060
It worked in every situation that I could think of to try.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.580
And I would love to say that there were no customer, but actually,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.340
I can say there were no customer bug reports ever on DST.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.900
But I don't think that many people actually use the feature.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.700
I don't think CE was used that much at that time.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.980
It didn't do an auto auto switch.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.540
I'm sure some for D for DST.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.900
Yeah. But I don't know.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.660
Again, this wasn't like something you went out and bought

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.140
a device with the Windows shell on it.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.820
I mean, the Windows shell was sample code.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.060
So basically, I wrote DST detection sample code for embedded developers.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.620
But at that point in time, that that I think was Windows Phone 6 5 days.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.140
No, it's before then. Before then. Before. Oh, really?

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.940
This is before Windows Phone 5. This was in.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.620
Well, the thing is, I'm willing to bet that that code went forward.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.300
Like who was going to rewrite that code?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.420
I don't know. I don't know.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.100
It might even be the code.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.900
I am here. I hope not.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.540
No, it's not.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.220
Brent's holding up his Windows Phone because Windows Phone is now based on Windows 10.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.020
Windows 10 embedded, not Windows CE, which was a whole different operating system.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.260
This was a true embedded.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.900
Well, I guess it's true embedded also.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.860
Very small, a true, small, componentized OS.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.660
I remember my friend and I used to play foosball all the time.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.460
He was actually the architect and I played foosball.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.020
Really smart guy.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.060
But we didn't like walking the 100 feet to the table to find out

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.460
somebody was already there.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.300
So you younger listeners may not remember floppy disks, but we had a floppy disk.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.660
One point four four Meg.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.620
It could boot our OS with a 1394 driver and a camera and a and a website

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.860
off of a one point four four.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.700
With the whole thing off there.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.180
So basically ran a foosball table monitor that booted and ran off of a floppy.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.500
Was it a camera?

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.140
How did you monitor?

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.820
Just a camera and a website. Oh, gotcha.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.220
We could actually do HTTP servers showing a video stream.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.140
I love it.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.820
Try that today.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.140
Try and boot that damn thing off of a two gig USB drive.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.050
Hey, I have a are we done with the ST?

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.370
I have a surprise topic.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.500
Oh, yeah, we're done with the ST.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.300
I don't know if I like surprises.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.660
I'm tingly.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.900
So I got you a gift.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.980
A gift, a gift.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.980
It is.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.780
I hope it's appropriate for podcast.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.780
It's not as relevant as it was when I ordered it,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.220
but this will probably shift into.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.590
And I know I know only two of the three at the most play video games,

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.310
but and I've been so busy, I haven't played my Xbox like in two weeks.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.430
But Brent and I was it just last episode.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.910
We haven't reported to episodes.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.110
Two episodes ago, talked about the fact that we were all like

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.590
playing Fallout like crazy, playing Fallout like crazy.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.270
And you can only laugh if you know it's gift means nothing.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.910
You haven't played the game, but it's a vault boy agility bobblehead.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.380
And it actually bobbleheads.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.060
Oh, my God.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.420
I went and looked at it and I'm like, ah, which one to get them?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.200
That is they didn't have one that was generically just special.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.720
Otherwise, I would have gotten that one.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.040
But the next appropriate one seemed like agility.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.160
Thank you very much.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.800
You betcha.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.000
That is fantastic.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.480
That will go up on my trophy case right next to my little doll of Deadpool.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.600
Did you see Deadpool?

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.000
I have not seen Deadpool yet.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.480
I don't know if you ever read the comic.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.200
I'm a big dead Deadpool's hilarious.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.840
I love Deadpool.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.480
What's his face?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.340
Ryan Reynolds, the guy that you feel like the part was written for him.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.300
There could be no other actor in the world that could play Deadpool.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.220
That's my sense from ceiling seeing seeing the trailers.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:36.940
Right.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.540
I think Ryan did.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.660
I'm with the rest of the world and saying he did a horrible job in Green

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.540
Lantern, but because because Green Lantern is DC and all the DC movies suck.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.350
I was a big I was I have a heavy Marvel bias from my childhood.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.550
I do as well.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:59.230
My my favorite character was Thor, and I think Marvel has totally screwed him up.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.830
Yeah, I don't like what they've done with the Thor movies.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.110
It's kind of weird, right?

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.910
And they the they're saying that the next iteration will be Thor as a woman

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.420
because anyone can pick up the hammer.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.700
Yeah. And there's a comic on that right, too.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.070
Yeah, I'm just like, really?

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.390
So this is the A.B.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.390
testing podcast.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.430
We should get there eventually.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.620
Yeah.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.860
So I sent Brent some mail this like three weeks ago.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.520
And the gist of it was 10 days ago.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.040
Was it just 10?

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.580
My world is just weirdly paced.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.380
It feels like it was so long ago.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.100
So much has happened since then and it made so much progress on that.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.620
It's weird.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.940
But anyway, the mail basically said, hey, Brent,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.120
you know, I can read the mail.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.640
Oh, why don't you read the mail?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.240
And for context,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.880
those of you may be listening to your first testing podcast,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.000
maybe your last week or you may be shutting it off right now.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.420
But I am the quality guy on an engineering team.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.940
I'm the guy that has to make sure that probably put it.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.620
I'm the guy responsible for or making sure that

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.780
quality work happens within the dev team.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.740
We're thinking about horizontals and we don't let anything follow through the cracks.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.020
There's the context.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.700
But I was running into a little bit of a problem.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.780
And as I as I do when I have questions or things I want to get some more ideas on,

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.100
I will reach out to those in my network.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.260
Brent is in my network and I sent him the following email.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.380
Getting to zero bugs is the title of the mail.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.700
Yes. Brent, curious on your advice here and how it compares with what I'm doing.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.440
We're down to fewer than 100 bugs across our product and continuing

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.560
when the wheels fell off.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.860
Bug counts and bug age are drifting up.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.300
Excuses are I want to fix this,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.700
but I have more important things to do.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.230
We're going to get a bunch more bugs when we're going to internal dog food.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.790
I don't want to stop writing features just to fix bugs.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.550
And those are a little exaggerated, but I wanted to I wanted to tickle something in,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.150
in Brent's rhetoric.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.350
Yes.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.590
Challenges at most teams are overbooked on features and used up their quote unquote

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.910
buffer time to add more features.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.720
To me, the challenge isn't caring about bugs,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.240
but helping the team balance features, bugs, automation, performance,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.680
the illities, et cetera, when all are important to ship.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.920
Balance all of these is interesting.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.120
How have your teams done this in the past?

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.480
And that was the main point.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.720
The bugs thing we will get under control, but it's the paraphrase version of that

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.600
is and don't you dare read your answer because I'm not OK, good.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.040
Having a low bug threshold or having a low number of bugs,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.080
it's important because it gives us the ability to better ability to respond to

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.040
customer requests without working on top of all the bugs that are, et cetera.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.280
But we also have to have good performance and good reliability and illities across

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.920
the board. We also have features that we think quote,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.330
think we need and other stuff.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.690
There's all kinds of how do you.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:20.280
So the question really is how do you balance all that stuff?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.280
Before we go into discussing that,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.480
because I want to try to turn this into sort of a brainstorming discussion.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.000
Just me and by the way, me reading back,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.040
Brent sent me a nice list of things that most of that were already on my radar.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.680
Should be feel good. Plus some new ideas.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.200
But but yes, from now, let's go back into brainstorming.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.600
Yeah.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:48.900
So I have received two other similar type problems recently.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.260
And the reason why I think it's similar is because I think it all comes down to

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.220
changing behavior or changing incentives.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.520
OK,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.080
first on my particular team, and this is very common.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.240
I do a lot of agile coaching, help people shift over.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.180
And there's this concept from the extreme programming called collective ownership.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.980
It's very important when you're trying to shift over to agile,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:26.700
but it's really hard to get individuals to buy in.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.140
The second one, let's go back into those.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.830
We'll talk about collective ownership a little bit.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.510
But let me let me cover all three.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.630
I just want to make sure I know the right place to properly interrupt and discuss.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.750
And then you can let me know.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.950
We can go wherever you want to go.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.710
I'm going to sit here quietly and you let me talk.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.630
Let me know when I can speak again.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.010
And then the last one is

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.720
we've had the discussion of generalists versus specialists.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:59.560
As we've talked in the past, I kind of teach people to I'm beyond teaching people

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.580
going through the scrum model, it's not ideal in my point of view.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.620
But there's a problem there.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:18.740
What happens if you follow either the scrum model or even the Kanban model

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:27.580
to the nth degree, it kind of encourages you to be an assembly line robotic generalist.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:34.260
And one of the current problems people have is how do I differentiate myself

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:40.180
from everybody else who's also a robotic generalist?

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.620
So there's this idea that,

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.970
sure, I'm bought into specialists are evil.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:58.780
But over pivoting on generalists is not what I personally want because I can't

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:03.790
differentiate when it comes to review cycle.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.350
I'm done with the perma on all these things.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.470
Where would you like to go next?

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.430
So collective ownership.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.110
Yes.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.950
And that time you started answering a little bit in the in the massive generalist.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:20.870
The generalist generalists predominantly

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:26.800
on the team, which we've talked and I've mentioned this a million times.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.030
I think imagining you have an engineering team where every single engineer owns

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.990
everything from soup to nuts is a little is a pipe dream.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.590
It just isn't one.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.670
You're not going to have that many generalists who can do all that.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.790
And two, stuff's going to fall through the cracks.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.270
There's nobody's really good at anything.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.580
Everybody's pretty good to OK at everything.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.300
So this is where I really believe the generalizing specialist or the

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.180
specializing generalist is critical.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.620
One, that's where differentiation happens.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.580
That's where you can shine.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.060
Yep.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.140
But two, and I want to talk both sides of this.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.740
That's where you can start to plug holes and not let things fall through the cracks.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.820
Huge believer in it again.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.980
Anybody listen to our podcast knows we believe in the generalizing specialist

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.700
specialized in generalist. Yes.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.460
The challenge is we give you the example of our team.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.500
The other end of that.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.780
I'm a big believer in that.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:25.420
We have a lot of it's less, but we still have a specialization on our team where we

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.620
want to move. We're moving towards more collective ownership.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.660
There are some places where we have examples of that.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.100
But in many places, there's too much expertise in the technology of the feature

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.220
area for other like for the larger team to come in and be effective in that area

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.420
quickly. What do you mean?

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.540
So feature, feature team A has some specific bit of technology or functionality

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.780
they're doing, even though it's in the same language, same, you know, same part of

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.260
the website team B, we can't there's no collective ownership between what team A

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.940
does and team B or little because the guys on team B, they don't really know how

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.540
the stuff in team A works at all.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.220
They can't come in there and be effective sharing code, fixing bugs.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.180
So as a team, they're in charge of

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.340
distinctly separate verticals within the product.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:21.260
Yes. Right now we have feature teams that work on distinct feature areas of the

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.660
product. We're getting less of that.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.970
In fact, one of our more

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.650
one of our better managers, hopefully they don't listen and think I'm stack

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.650
ranking them, but one of our I think one of our better managers actually quote,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.490
air quotes owns a set of disparate features.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.050
He's the guy sort of the kitchen sink

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:44.130
guy because he has no problem with his team flowing between things.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.930
And he's sort of I think he's sort of figured that out, although he has sort of

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.770
specialists on his team.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.090
It's more of the example of what I want to see across a larger team where there's

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.000
more flow out to me.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.040
If I had my druthers, I could be in charge.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.720
I just I'd have managers who had people working for them that they coached and

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.320
mentored, etc. But as far as what features they worked on,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.680
be a lot more fluid as was needed by the project by the project in times, etc.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.880
Well, we're I believe we're in a transition where we can get somewhere closer to that.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.600
But right now, as far as collective ownership goes, it's difficult because we

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.040
have too much expertise, expertise, specialists in certain vertical feature

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.420
areas. The just to add a little extra color to what you just said, because the

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:37.860
every time I go in and I do another coaching session, bring another team online,

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.380
I walk them through this and they nod their heads and buy in.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:49.140
And it's because it takes a few months for them to execute,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:57.400
to realize, number one, that assigning allocation resources to projects

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.760
from an ROI point of view actually makes the team better and makes everyone else

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.640
better, because much like what you just described, it would be super fluid.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.040
You'd have perhaps a shared backlog.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.000
People come in. Anyone can add an item to the backlog.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.000
It automatically or very low friction gets stacked ranked appropriately.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.800
The top ones get doled out to whoever is available to do the work.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.680
OK,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:32.540
management very quickly buys into this model and is primarily because it's awesome.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.980
OK,

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:43.020
and employees, after they get over the,

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.930
hey, maybe it's not so bad not just being a specialist.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.370
I think it over this.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.010
They go, wow, you know what?

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.810
Every two weeks I get an endorphin rush because I'm producing a new thing and I

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.250
can immediately see if it was useful or not.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:05.260
Creates a sense of purpose that was more than

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.420
what the prior review model does.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:13.300
The prior review model is, hey, I created a bunch of features,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.900
let's say in the case of something like Windows or Office, where it used to be

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.540
three years, I created a bunch of features.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.820
It's review time now.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.700
The features I just built aren't going to go out for another two years.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.900
So how do I get reviewed?

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.050
I get reviewed based off of a bunch of people's opinions.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:39.850
Right. No, no extrinsic sense of purpose or value.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.330
It's all I did better than Alan, therefore, I'm awesome.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.900
And I'm going to let you finish.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.980
But I don't think that I don't think the

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:57.860
updates in Microsoft's review model necessarily will have helped that in every

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.860
org, have changed that.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:06.380
There are large orgs at Microsoft, large orgs that

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.660
I was pointing in an object in the room to reference with the org

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.800
where it still features.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.440
It's not quality, it's features.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.840
Yet I hear about some orgs where

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:23.800
execs say features are second place to quality and they back it up.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.240
So it really depends on leadership and what they value.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.520
And in fact, any time you're on a team talking about these opinions of others,

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.840
it's really based on what your manager and your team around you, what they value.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.640
Right.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.800
More than anything.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.260
If they value features, if they over quality in the in reviews or whatever,

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.580
they're going to any sort of feedback, they're going to base that on those values.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.130
It's tangents.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.850
It's an interesting system.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.450
Right.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.340
Because certain one offs like that,

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.020
I can easily take a team, a team that has that sort of value system.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.940
I can once I know that that's the key, the root value that's causing it,

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.820
then I can go attack that and get rid of that.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.740
Right.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.380
And for me, I think it's critical that the team knows if the team knows what you

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.420
value, they're going to maybe you're going to talk about this.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.740
No, I want to.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.740
But let me.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:29.540
So if if the team has a shared set of values, like we care about quality,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.020
we care about collaboration, we care about velocity, for example,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:38.700
that doesn't be what you care about and you as a leader in that group,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.500
whether you're a manager or an exec or just a technical leader, I see if you as

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.620
a leader celebrate and point out on people,

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.380
do those things, they do show great examples of collaboration.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.180
They show great examples of of

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.300
value and quality or getting some shiny new feature in the product.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.180
If you when you bring those up publicly

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.500
to the group, other people will want to get that.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.820
Those accolades to them will do the same things.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.580
Yes. And the opposite will happen to you.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.890
If you say we must add these features, getting these features done and into our

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.090
product is above all the most important thing.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.740
That's exactly what will happen.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.540
Despite you will always get more of what you measure.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.700
Correct. Yeah.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.380
Nobody has ever heard that before.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.380
No. Yeah.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.380
The one.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.300
But just to close off what I would mean by the generalizing versus specializing as

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:41.100
as a new level of maturity gets into an agile team and the management gets it in

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:48.020
the ICs get it the ICs then notice a general tendency

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.270
towards

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.820
generalization.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.260
Right.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.340
There's a general tendency that managers go, hey, I do the stack rank.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.340
Here's the ROI.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.620
People should just pick the top ROI thing

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.560
regardless of whether or not it's something that is interesting.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:14.740
So then overuse of this type of system will reduce people's

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:22.420
love of the system because it it's removing their autonomy,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:28.530
their ability to to master something that's of interest to them.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.780
Anyway,

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.540
in a paragraph or two, like that's possible for you.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.660
What would you say if what I say to you, hey, what's the high level advice you have?

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:46.460
What should I do? What action should I take to help the team balance quality,

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.780
ill it is any sort of quality stuff along with advancing features?

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.100
How do you make that balance as an engineering team?

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.780
The very first thing that I would I would say is you've got to understand

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.100
the incentives of the people involved, as we said, over and over and over and over

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.100
and over and over again, it is always a people problem.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.860
The thank you, Jerry Weinberg.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.740
Yes.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.780
The situation you you talked about as you were talking about the the value

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.930
systems of the team, right?

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.050
I've encountered multiple teams have gone in and they were like, hey,

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.760
this is our value system.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.440
Well, what do I do as a coach when I can

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.320
readily see that the value system is actually the cause?

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.910
If they have a value system of velocity, velocity is a great thing.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.510
But

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:42.630
that as as part of your value system could actually I've seen it also over and

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:46.070
over and over again, where if you have your value system be

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:51.620
velocity, then it negatively impacts adaptability.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.490
The first thing I would do is say it honestly doesn't matter.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.910
Number one,

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.940
make what you do transparent.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:09.140
The more you make it transparent and show how you are measuring towards

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.780
your value system,

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.940
then it will be a matter of time before someone smart or a bunch of people

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.980
smart within your team go, hey, wait a minute.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.180
These things that we see on a day to day

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.320
basis that is transparent is not aligning towards our value system.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.120
And then it starts to create a conflict between what's right, the

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:42.030
specific data that we're showing on a day to day basis or the value system.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:47.550
Get adaptability part of the value system as a first cousin.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:56.100
OK, and then recognize that it is a it's a people problem first and foremost.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:02.100
And what I put in Alan's mail is also what I think about first is

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:07.500
everybody on the team wants the Daniel Pink

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.240
motivations, but that's dead.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.160
What is it? Mastery, autonomy, autonomy and purpose.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.400
Correct. Right.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.360
Huge.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.040
The E.B. testing podcast are huge fans of Dan Pink.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.040
Absolutely.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.560
So how do you how do you change the

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:31.820
incentive structure such that it is aligning to

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.540
the actual value system that is important, whether or not it's the one that's

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.700
published, right, there's also we can throw in all kinds of quotes.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.660
We got we got Weinberg, we got Pink.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:50.140
So let's throw in Amor as well and write the what is it, the fourth order.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.420
How do we create a method by which we

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.900
understand that which we don't know, we don't know?

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.700
Right. And transparency is what does that.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.660
We need a suitable mechanism for discovering what we don't know.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.700
We don't know. Philip Armour.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.940
So do you remember about 25 minutes ago when I asked Brent for that paragraph

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.060
answer to my question?

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.020
I was looking at the time it was four minutes ago.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.740
Yeah, Brent can't tell the time it's DST at the bug.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.700
So this actually reminds me, I last you know what?

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.700
I've lost all sense of time a weekish ago, maybe a little more.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.500
I spent a little bit of time on a Skype call with one of the three.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.980
There's shout out to Percy.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.380
Percy, whoo.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.740
Thanks for listening to Purrs. Purrs.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.300
It's not Purrs though, it's Purrs.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.300
I know.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.500
I was being all cool on the deets and things.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.420
Now it's called the offended.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.220
He's a cool guy.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.620
Sounds like Purrs.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.500
Z.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:52.860
Right. Anyway, I don't know why I

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.980
go off on these tangents that I have to edit.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.580
Right. Thanks, Brent.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.780
Or maybe I won't.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.540
So anyway, you want to know more about this, what it means for an engineering team

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.020
and devs to own test.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.340
And part of what we're talking about was in my answer to him.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.660
I'm not going to recap our whole call.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:17.020
It was fun for me just to sort of brain dump what we do as a way for as

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.380
sometimes when you talk through something, you end up explaining it and discovering

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.860
things about like, oh, maybe I want to change this and do something differently

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.860
and blah, blah, blah.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.580
So I'll give you some of the highlights

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.700
and talk about this balance, which has been fun for me.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.100
So as you know, we don't have we don't have a testing.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.980
We have a couple of vendors that help out with some of the matrix of ideas.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.660
But as far as verification and throwing things over the wall,

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.900
you throw it over the wall to yourself.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.100
You bounce it on the ground in front of you, whatever the right metaphor is.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.420
So my team, I expanded my team, I doubled my team size.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.220
I didn't tell you this.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.060
I now have two people on my team.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.340
Nice. Way to go.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.100
And we own everything from the moment

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.850
code is checked in until it gets deployed to production.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.450
I say own as ownership.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.370
It's not a quality thing, but we're responsible for making sure all that goes

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.010
smoothly, so build pipeline, test pipeline, making sure things get

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.410
the tools are in place to increase efficiency,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.130
developer productivity, et cetera, et cetera, all happens.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.890
So you own the flow of the assembly line.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.810
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.330
We keep we keep the wheels turning.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.450
That's a good way to put it.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.610
We keep the wheels turning.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.530
So how do we scale that to quality?

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:33.180
And again, if I may rant every, you know, I'm so annoyed with the testing world

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:40.020
of self-proclaimed system thinkers who can't believe that there's ever a possible

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.300
way for a team without testers to produce a quality product.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:48.340
Every time they see a bug, whether it's a major bug or, you know,

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:53.420
a font is clipped, they they point out the fact this is what happens

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.520
when you don't have testing and they're just stupid.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.680
I'll tell you right now, you're stupid.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.000
The problem is in a nutshell, it's also what happens when you do.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.400
Exactly.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.360
Exactly. You know what?

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.440
The testing still happens.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.800
Stop. I think it's self preservation or often or tweet bait or both.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.200
But it just drives me crazy.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.340
I've I've there are testers.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.020
I follow on Twitter who I honestly don't know why I follow because they just push

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.530
my buttons with their their stuck in 1980 and it drives me crazy.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.520
I don't know why.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.880
Because they're like in the net because I understand that there are testers out

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.200
there and test teams out there and engineering teams out there that are

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.040
stuck in 1980 and they need consultants that live in 1980 along with them.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.960
And that's fine.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.160
I don't want that to be my world.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.560
But anyway, back to my story.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.760
A couple of things we've done is we have the highlights.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.960
We have three environments.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.800
We have a C.I. environment, a pre-production environment and a production environment.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.240
We have a couple of contract vendors and I refuse to let them touch anything

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.480
in C.I. C.I. is where developers play.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.080
They can go look and make sure their stuff is working, etc.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.120
And we'll look at stuff across a large matrix when it gets to pre-production.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.280
So that helps scale things as well, too.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.680
They know that initial verification all there is making sure it works.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.920
They own that completely.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.680
The developers write unit tests.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.370
They write integration tests.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:23.330
They perform their own bug bashes or bug, you know, focused exploratory sessions

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.210
with the long story for another podcast.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.170
They do that work.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.370
And then so that's good.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:34.510
And then there are things around.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.950
Do you remember in the old days, like you were in exchange, you were in office.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:43.550
I was never office used to have like these drivers like the accessibility driver

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:49.570
across office, it was some tester, almost always.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.410
They put in charge of gathering stuff up across the teams and blah, blah, blah.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.810
Every team is has a unique culture.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.290
One of the things that come out of office

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:06.120
that I noticed is office believes very strongly in just hordes of teams.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.160
Oh, they do, too.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.680
And we've talked about our loathing of teams before.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.660
So anyway, I looked at performance, load,

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.740
accessibility, security, internationalization.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.140
I looked at my team one, two, I said, crap, we know that stuff.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.780
So I took one of my peer engineering

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.660
managers, very senior level dev managers, and I took five of them.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.380
And guess what?

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.060
They are my dotted line test leads in charge of accessibility,

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.860
internationalization, et cetera, et cetera. Nice.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.460
So they're in charge of driving that stuff all across the team.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.460
They're drivers.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.900
They're collectors, drivers.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.530
OK.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.010
Dashboard fillers.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.930
Do they know that they're dotted line test leads?

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:50.610
Absolutely.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.330
I tell them that all the time I meet with them regularly and I make sure

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.650
that they're gathering the right data for me, preparing what they need.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:00.130
So I really treat them like they, you know, they get a half hour or so

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.610
of my time a week to make sure they're getting the right stuff together in a

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:07.050
clear, cohesive way that we can consolidate, et cetera, et cetera,

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:10.330
and make sure deadlines are in place that we're they make sure they know the

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.210
schedule, all the stuff that a test lead would normally do.

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:14.130
But OK.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.450
And the thing is, it's weird.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.330
In some ways, they're good at it because they're more senior and able

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:20.610
to work better across the team.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.170
But in some ways, because they've never done it before, they're just like the

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.100
most junior test they've ever dealt with.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:30.070
So it's it's it's the only way to make it happen.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.870
Yep.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.790
But it's it's an interesting process to watch.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:40.320
I've seen that before, too, in helping developers across two teams now write tests.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.960
All the things we learned years and years ago about writing automated tests,

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.080
the dumb things to do as well as things work pretty well.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.760
It doesn't matter whether you're

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.320
a entry level or a super senior mega architect level.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.330
When you start writing tests, automated tests, you kind of suck at it.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.130
In general, most people do.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.250
And they need to help to go.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.850
How often have you heard it?

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.090
Just just had a curiosity.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.890
How often have you heard someone on your

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:11.280
dead team ask the following question, couldn't we just set up a test recorder?

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.560
Actually, I've never heard that.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.640
Oh, good. Thank God.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.640
I work with a team of pretty smart people.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.000
Yeah, they just it's really experience based versus critical thinking based.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.800
OK.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.840
We just had a unit test bug last week where we tried to promote our dev build to pre

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.360
production, which we only do twice a week.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.440
And it failed because someone had hard coded the unit test, the brand unit test,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.540
hard coded the path to the dev environment.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.420
And I thought about calling them out

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.580
in mail and then I and but again, I don't like celebrating or pointing out

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.660
huge mistakes. I don't know if that's a I don't know if that's a

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.900
that's a harass worthy fail, right?

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.740
It was clearly a mistake.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.740
Again, but if his unit test was testing

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:01.340
code under the assumption that it was in the development environment,

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.260
then maybe it shouldn't go forward when it goes into.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.420
We run unit tests again when we go to pre-prod.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.300
But anyway, I sort of my philosophy is I really try and celebrate when people

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.940
are doing things well, for example, we had one team like about balancing these

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.580
things, they self proclaim that they had a little bug backlog build up.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.260
So they self proclaim themselves in bug jail.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.940
And that meant is that like for this iteration, for this week,

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.900
we're not going to work on features.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.280
We're going to work on getting our bugs fixed only.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.440
Except for what there's one critical thing had to come on.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.660
So one developer on that, everybody else focused on debt.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.570
They did that on their own.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:39.650
I was happy to watch that.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:44.370
Not that sort of technique works better when you have collective ownership.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.530
You can scale that across.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.490
Yeah. One thing I mentioned is I talked

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:52.010
to a few people at similar companies with a similar size to our team.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:59.420
And one thing they do is they dedicate one person per team, managerial team,

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.860
whether it's a featured team or not, per iteration,

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.100
usually one or two weeks to just focus on debt.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.380
So one person is offline from feature work.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.200
That's focusing on debt.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.160
Yeah, I hate that model.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.440
I'm not against it.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.440
I'm going to.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.720
It's it's way better than ignoring the debt.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.840
I would rather just have everyone fix it as they go along.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.800
Yeah. And the one other thing that I'm going to start up

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.640
in the next few weeks here is because of my one, two people and all the work we

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.880
have and I also believe that I mentioned this to my boss that we are one more morbid

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.190
alert, we are one bus crash away from not being able to keep the engine running.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:39.630
My team keeps the engine running.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:44.710
There's a lot of specialty built up and expertise built up and knowledge built up

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.230
that isn't shared across the team.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.350
So you are you have you have a specialist bottleneck?

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.270
I do.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:55.870
So one thing I want to do very soon that I'm planning to start very soon is start

00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:01.260
rotating the dev team through my team, so I'll spend I'll spend a week

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.800
working for me, ramping up on knowledge,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.400
virtualizing that knowledge of how things work.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.880
I think what happens in the past when I've done similar things is people

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.000
recognize efficiencies and they create some tools or automation or process around

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.640
them to make them more efficient.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.040
We did something similar in my team recently.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.240
We call it the DRI, the designated responsible individual.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.400
And that's actually what I'm going to use is we have a DRI who mainly focuses

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.200
on live site and we add the backup who kind of shadows them, make sure they're

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.360
ready for the next week.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.080
And the backup DRI is also going to dotted line to me and work on

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.000
infrastructure so that DRI is going to double up.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.110
I had one of my ICs pull together a DRI V team.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.670
I'm not a V team.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:48.870
Well, the way I do V teams, I'm OK with because I start them with an end.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:49.870
The very first.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.630
Yeah, the this is the goal.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.830
Once this goal is achieved, this meeting is gone.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.030
Right. This goodness group to spans.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.260
And

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.060
because

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.980
we don't have a bug database, but we still have bugs, all the bugs come across

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.060
as tickets on our task board.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:16.580
And I went specifically looked for sticky notes

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.780
that I wanted to find sticky notes that were black because I wanted it a bug to

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.780
what color pen do you write on them with?

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.220
You can get.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.580
All right, whatever. Go on.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.380
I had to get pins that were right on there.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.260
Like I kind of knew there'd be an answer.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.190
Yeah. All right. Go on.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:37.540
Black sticky notes are hard to find, but I can find blood red ones.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.660
So that's what we use.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:47.460
And people when we're when it's the only thing that causes an interrupt.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:54.460
Once we got the team to the point of a bug, once it lands on the board,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.350
we have to turn it around in 48 hours.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.630
And so when the team sees just hordes and hordes of hordes of bugs coming across,

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:07.390
we have weekly retrospectives that is completely now run by the team.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:12.070
I've actually kicked out all management from the retrospective meetings.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.590
So they it's highly transparent.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.800
They see the cause and effect.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.440
When they go into retrospective, they go, holy crap,

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:29.330
we had 20 bug tickets this time and we only executed on two of the plan tickets.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:36.170
What happens is very much different than what I see in, say,

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.540
teams much like you describe.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:45.850
People go, we have to figure out what's causing these bugs and root that out

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:52.660
because that is what's slowing us down from executing against the plan versus

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.060
I don't want to work on the bugs.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.180
I want to do more features.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.540
So there's a story that I'm going to tell.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.900
Yeah. We'll go on to the final thing.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.760
Yeah. It's a parable fable.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:08.090
It's not one of those guy walking out and he's walking near a river.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.810
He's somebody floating by.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.890
So he calls his friend and his friend runs out and tries to go save him.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:17.970
Then there's two more people floating by in the river and more people from the village

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.090
run out and try and save them.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.130
Then people are floating down the river and everybody from the village is running

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:24.010
out, grabbing them, saving them and bringing them to the shore.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:28.610
And my friend starts this guy starts walking up the river upstream.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.250
Somebody goes, where are you going?

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:30.930
We need help.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:36.140
He goes, I'm going up to see you throwing all these people on the river.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.690
Yep.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.940
So you know what it's time for?

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.100
Everybody knows what everybody knows what it's time for.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.460
Mailbag.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.800
Hey, everybody. It's time for the mailbag.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.440
Yes. Very exciting.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.240
Very exciting.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.920
Denny Fott on Twitter has done something that I've only this is the only only.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.040
He's now one of the three, but he is the only one of the three I know who has

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.200
done this particular thing that is binge listen to AB testing.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400
Yes. I saw that.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.720
I'm like, wow.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.160
I can't imagine a deeper, more painful experience than binge listening,

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:20.400
AB testing. So huge props to Danny for

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.570
I don't know if there is alcohol or drugs involved and I'm not going to judge.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.650
But Danny had a question.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:30.610
We have hugely improved our use of drugs.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:31.570
Now, yes, we have.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:35.610
No, I actually periodically go back and listen to episode one and two.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.290
And I just go, wow.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:39.770
It's actually all the production

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.850
quality of the production staff of AB testing.

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.370
Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.100
So Danny asks how along the same lines

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.500
a developer owns testing is ties into our last topic is he asks,

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:57.180
how well do you expect developers to master functional test design skills?

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.540
And it's actually there's a 11.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.420
There's a depth to that question.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.620
There's yeah.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:08.500
Because at a level of should developers be able to do functional test design?

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.060
Absa freaking Lutely.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.220
Should they master it?

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.140
Now let's talk about Abso freaking Lutely.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.020
How well should they master it?

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:23.900
That's actually where the MBU as well as they need to to have a sustainable business.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.620
Yeah. And but the thing is

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.940
for actually all of the three, I think, are pretty experienced testers.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:35.340
How many of the three rhetorical question because you can't answer because this is

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.460
so you don't have a microphone, nor are you connected to my laptop.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.460
But if I were to ask you, have you mastered functional test design?

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.320
And I think I'm pretty good at functional test design.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.480
I don't know if I can self proclaim myself a master or not.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.880
I always think of new things.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.560
And I don't know.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.080
What does it mean to be a master at all?

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.880
I think a master is just the ability to teach others.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.920
They confidently teach others because most masters on any topic,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.920
they will give you some sort of Confucius quote with the more I learn,

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.240
the more I have left to learn.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.440
Right. Exactly.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.920
But I think it takes time.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.320
Is a brand new developer or a tester going to walk in the door

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.520
knowing mastering functional test design?

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.360
No. But if you're responsible for functional

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:29.510
quality, whether you're a developer or a tester, over time you approach or you

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.510
get closer and closer to mastery.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:34.150
I don't think there's anything there is.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:39.870
In fact, there will be testers with job self preservation in mind who think that,

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:45.110
no, coders, people who write code cannot master functional test design,

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:50.270
which is B.S. because they can just as well as anybody who's become a tester

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:56.190
where that testing mind where the testing mind kicks in is not in functional test

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:59.830
design mastery. It's in those weird corner cases.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.390
Those thinking of the system is finding, you know what?

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:10.590
I think if I am in this time zone and I switch to this time zone right at this

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:11.990
time, I bet it'll fail.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:14.350
Let me set up something to simulate that boom.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:16.230
Cool bug that no one will ever find.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:18.610
But bad example.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:23.410
But I think where the test mind kicks in, the people that are really good at

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.570
testing in investigation, exploring, etc.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:35.170
It's not their specialty, their value to the product doesn't come in their mastery

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.410
of functional test design.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.290
That's a learnable skill that any any software engineer can do.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:47.970
Even where I think their mastery comes from is their ability to instinctively see

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:50.770
risks in the system and exploit them.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.210
Sure. Even that is trainable.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:53.690
Yeah.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:58.290
It's actually one of the classes that I'm taking this semester.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.730
The professor has a passion for risk management.

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:06.650
And as we go through our projects, he's asking us to focus on risks.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:11.010
And what I've discovered as I've gone through this thing is he's basically

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:20.330
backing me into sort of TDD through this back end process of thinking,

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.930
considering and thinking about the risks.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.850
And I'm really like, huh, interesting.

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:30.070
I have to talk to the professor about this and say, hey,

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:34.190
you might want to formalize this because there's this whole community of

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:40.550
developers out there who think it's magic when it's it really isn't.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:41.670
It really isn't.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.870
But I think of any of the things that are considered functional test design.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:47.590
And I always give a shout out to Lee Copeland, who I think has the best sort

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:52.350
of overview, readable overview and understanding of what test design is.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:57.870
There's no rocket science or math critical Confucius skills in there.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.470
It's just, oh, I need to know this.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:00.390
This is learnable.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:01.630
Now I know this.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:05.590
And I've taught these things through code review, through feedback, like, hey,

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.630
make sure you have a test that handles when you have negative input.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:09.710
Oh, yeah, good idea.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:10.350
And guess what?

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.710
Then they learn that and they do that for every time they have a function

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.110
that takes an integer that can be signed.

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:16.510
These are all learnable traits.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.390
Completely agree.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:22.190
I'm going to take a stab at directly answering Danny's question.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.750
Wait, this is the first.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.910
We're going to directly answer a question on A-B testing.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.110
We'll see.

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:31.790
So he asked, how well do you expect developers to master functional test

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:34.910
design skills? When I think about his question, I think about two things.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:38.190
Number one, one is a coverage question.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:41.950
And another one is a value add question.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:47.620
And in other words, I don't want developers to go in and just create test

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.780
cases, the test case bloat we used to have when we had a bunch of testers.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.260
Right.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.700
We have we're testing calculator.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.940
Oh, let's do a test case one plus one, one plus two, one plus three.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.910
No, we don't need that.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:09.510
What I do expect them to be able to master is the positive and the negative cases.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:16.510
And in additionally, be able to master their test case design to objectively

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:22.470
defend the test cases they do not have.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:26.590
In other words, to say, hey, yes, that's a test case.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:27.510
Absolutely.

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.110
I could pull that in.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:33.690
The value proposition isn't there.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:38.750
I would use a reactive design,

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.350
a written on a reactive design, a reactive motivator.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.990
I will let customers tell me I was re-listening to our redfin.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.710
And our example in the redfin was this

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:54.070
buy dye character set in the middle of Georgia on February 29th.

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.750
You know what?

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:58.910
I'm going to let the the life site telemetry tell me that that's important.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:03.590
Somewhere right now, someone's screaming, you can't let the customers do the testing.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.830
It's not fair.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.910
You can.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.420
And I'm at a point where if if you are

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.620
an engineer and you are you caring about the business,

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:21.260
I'm at a point where I firmly believe you are morally obligated to do so.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:27.900
So a lot of a customer is the only person who understands the quality proposition

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.140
of your output. That is absolutely correct.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.380
I believe you.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.660
One interesting thing.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.500
And thanks, Danny, for the question.

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:38.100
But I want to add one little follow up to that before we close here for the day.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.580
It was what I believe in.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.100
The whole system I'm building is, as far

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.460
as quality on my team, is being able to react.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.100
I want to I want to have an engineering

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:53.020
system and a feedback system and and quality in place that we can react

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.700
quickly to customer complaints, requests, ideas, etc.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.100
And obviously we won't just listen to every

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.060
single feature that comes in and go, oh, my God, we got to do that.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.580
We'll look at things in collective and prioritize and do the right thing.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.740
But I want I don't want to put myself

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.700
in a position or put our team in a position where we can't react to that.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.820
I was in a meeting last week where

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:16.030
unrelated to my product, but we're talking about

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:21.990
the quality and this big release that went out and there was a manager in the room

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:25.790
that said, so we'll have to let the customers can find those bugs.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.420
This is testing and production.

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.820
And it was a pretty senior guy.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.940
So I didn't I think it's a it's an abuse term now, I guess.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:34.940
Testing and production.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.420
Yeah, it is a little bit because I knew and I didn't call them out.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.540
But I talked to some of the other people in the room afterwards, after he left.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:48.460
But to me, yes, it's it's no, it's just it's just bugs and production, really,

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.620
because they ship monthly at best.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.220
There's no way for them to react.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.420
Sometimes it's three months.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.500
For me, test you do testing and production.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.220
When you can when you get Delta between

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.340
hearing about or actually not even hearing about it, discovering an error

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:09.070
ideally automatically through monitoring to mitigating or fixing that error

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:13.510
has to be the smallest time possible, not in the matter of hours,

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:17.710
maybe days if you're slow, but not months, no more than a week.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:21.670
And so I that really kind of stirred something up.

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.830
I mean, you reminded me of that when you're talking about your answer.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:27.870
There is is yes, the customers and I am on all four months

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:31.190
using monitoring and diagnostics figure out how they're using the product.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:32.990
But you got to be able to react to that.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:34.230
You can't just go, yep, that's a bug.

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:35.350
We'll put it in the backlog and we'll

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.350
prioritize it to fix some of the future day.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:41.070
One of the things that crazy one of the things I would say is an overall theme

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:46.830
for what we were talking about today is the real value out of a systems thinker

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:51.150
is to really understand the balance between black and white.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.630
Almost always you need both black and both white.

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:55.630
You do.

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:58.110
Should we go all reactive?

00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.470
No, that's stupid.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.870
You will not have a business after a week.

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.470
Should we go all proactive?

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.790
No, that's stupid because you're now

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:10.990
handing all of your business to your competitor because you're going to go too

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:17.790
slow. So how do you balance these things is an important role for anyone who who is

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.470
actually a systems thinker inside their organization.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:24.230
That's actually really important because I and we're often tangent

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.390
those to try and close on here.

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:30.110
But it's a technique I use time and time again is to look at the extremes.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.590
It's a system thinking is about balance.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:33.990
Yeah. And one way to kind of figure

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:37.990
out where that balance is is think about the extremes and figure what that is and

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:39.110
what that means.

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:45.930
So what does it mean if we have 100 testers for every developer?

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:47.970
We don't have to go through that.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:51.210
OK, let's let's let's enumerate what happens there.

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.010
Thought exercise for listeners.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.570
Now what if we have one tester for 100 developers?

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:59.050
What's different for your context, for your product?

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.730
And maybe the answer is in between.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.290
Maybe it's closer to one stream or not.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.050
But that's for you to figure out.

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:08.650
The other thing, too, though, is see, you know, I don't think that's it.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:14.170
But to blindly say that one extreme is wrong is if you say that and call yourself

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.970
a system thinker, you're just an idiot because you don't even know what either

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:20.810
means. Yeah. But your extremes, the ones that go is a bad experience.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:25.680
I'm just like, one is wrong and the other one is great.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:29.600
So in this particular case, it's not one like the balance would be on one of the

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.240
extremes, in my humble opinion.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.560
Anyway,

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.280
but you need to think about the extremes to figure out how to balance.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.240
That's the point.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:41.080
And how would you judge between a selection in between?

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.160
Right. The interesting thing about thinking

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:48.480
about these extremes that I find valuable is I go, OK, which one do I like?

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.360
Why do I like it or not?

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:57.680
Can I turn that into an objective measure that I can then use to

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.640
guide where I should actually be?

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.800
Like using the extremes, you can immediately have a visceral reaction.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.760
I go, oh, my God, one to 100 testers.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.510
Let me give a different example for the same people who because they tend

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:17.470
to be the same people who think testing and production is idiotic and stupid and

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:24.150
irresponsible. Like, can you think of a product where that would be

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:26.720
OK and one where it wouldn't be OK?

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:27.760
Testing and production.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.440
Yeah. Or can you think of let's take 100 percent automation.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.800
Is there 100 percent test automation?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.080
Is there a situation where that would be

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:40.400
the right answer versus the wrong answer? What if it was just an API

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.160
that wasn't even exposed to customers?

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.440
I like your prior pick one air traffic control software.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:52.740
That one probably shouldn't be tested in production.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:53.780
There we go.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:58.100
All right, Brent, we have used up more than all of our time.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.220
Yep.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.780
So let's say goodbye until next time.

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.540
But you know what, actually,

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.460
this one can be a little longer because it took a little longer break between

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.260
the last one and this one and no, I'm not going to be like split it up into two.

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.740
You get one shot. What episode was this?

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:16.420
I didn't announce it at the beginning. 35. I did.

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.420
At least one of us.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.860
OK, we'll see you soon for episode 36.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:24.440
I am Alan. I am Brent.

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.400
I thought I fool you. Yeah, well done.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.680
We'll see you guys next time. Bye.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.320
Ah.
