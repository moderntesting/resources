WEBVTT

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.530
Hey, it's episode 33 of A.V. Testing. I'm Alan. I'm Brent and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.810
For better or for worse. We're back. What year is it Alan? 2016. Good job. What's what's the wrong answer?

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.760
Anything other than 2016? You know what? This isn't on the board, but you know, it's wrong

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.440
2016

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.240
We've covered this. Yeah. Okay. I think we covered it like exactly a year ago because we didn't call it

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.750
1910 we called it 1910. I don't get it. No, it's 2016

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.790
I get that it was awkward to say 2001 or 2002. Yeah

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.590
onboard, but once we passed the 10 mark, it's 2010 and

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.810
We just found a dead animal in the palatial podcast studios

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.770
But actually it was just the sound on

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.610
Brent's phone so I got a new phone and there are

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.370
Still random noises they come out of like what the hell was that sound me? I will I don't know if the podcast picked that up

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.370
But that gave me a little chill

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.850
It kind of sound like a speaking of a chill, you know, I've been

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.820
Took a little time over the holidays

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.580
Yeah, I saw I saw on Twitter that you picked up

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.540
Snowboarding. No, I want no I snowboarded once my daughter wants to switch from skiing to snowboarding

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.780
So we thought it'd be a fun little family thing a lot of families go to movies and we went to Star Wars

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.380
Yeah, as it are or bowling we say we take the whole family. We're all gonna give snowboarding a shot just for one night and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.540
We my daughter kicked butt she's gonna be totally great I

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.940
Did

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:10.180
Better than I thought I would but one thing about learning to snowboard is you fall a lot and when you're older and bigger like me

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.000
Those falls man. I I'm still recovering from a couple of them. I have never snowboard. I

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.720
Haven't downhill skied the last time we skied was like 10 years ago and it was cross-country

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.800
So as you know, as I'm sure I've mentioned on the podcast. I'm on a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.040
Now don't take this the wrong way

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.320
I'm on a ski racing team

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.680
But it's really an excuse to go down the hill and then drink beer when you're done. It's it's it's competitive

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.920
But not it's like a think bowling is it like last one down the hill buys no think bowling on a ski slope

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.200
It's head-to-head. I'm gonna erase twice a night on you go up on Thursday nights, but

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240
it is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.960
I'm not wearing any specialized gear or anything

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.840
I'm just trying to beat the guy next to me

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.280
And then once I'd finished my second race

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.780
I go straight to the little ski hut at the bottom and get some beer that

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.050
Except for the whole exercise bit that almost seems like a perfect day

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.770
I like skiing is how I get through look out the window Brent you guys in podcast

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.490
I can't see the window, but you see the typical Seattle dark gray cold fog here

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.650
Fog is all the way up to the floor 20. That's impressive. Yeah, it's gross. Hey one aside. So

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.950
Your family went to see Star Wars. We did my family went to see Star Wars

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.730
Spoiler alert. No spoilers. Let's not make

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.930
On those spoilers that makes no we shouldn't spoil

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.460
So far no spoilers here's the challenge Alan what's the top

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.760
positive and the top negative thing

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.560
About the new Star Wars movie from your point of view positive thing is the movie rocked

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.240
The top negative thing is the next one doesn't come out for 18 months

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.420
Now that was well done on the no spoiler, but that was boom boring and safe

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.530
I'll show you boring and safe. I do that every podcast. Oh

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.770
Oh

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.690
You set them up I'll knock them down are we going anywhere with this no, all right. I guess not

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.370
All right, you scared me with the whole spoiler thing. I don't like yeah

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.250
It was a good movie. We'll talk about it later and the and if you want to I mean the internet is full of

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.890
Theories already. It's great. I

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.090
I'll put it this way. My favorite part was like really like the ending

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.300
Even though you could kind of see that the ending was gonna happen throughout the whole movie

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.500
Yeah, but there was something about the way they did it. Yeah, I agree but

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.330
the biggest thing that bugged me is

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.020
Except for I don't think hey Han and Leia are in this movie. I don't think that's a spoiler

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:11.260
Except for Han and Leia. I thought it interesting the ages of the entire leadership in the entire movie

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.500
All of the generals were like 20 something's

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.740
alright, and I'm like

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.780
That just sat with me as like

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.080
Really? Maybe they dude, maybe they they're like these in humans that they're actually like 150 years old

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.240
I looked at hopefully he explains it. Otherwise, I just like this is weird

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.390
General Tarkin

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.630
He was intimidating because he looked old and grizzled and he knew he's killed billions before

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.150
All right. Anyway, so can we move on or did you need to do anything else in your holidays that is worth

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.950
discussing for our three listeners

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.310
So obviously the holiday thing

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.970
It was a break for me from from school and from work

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.650
So the first time in like two years I got reacquainted with my Xbox

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.390
Oh, I was gonna mention that because I saw that you and I have been playing the same game lately

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.350
You I've only been playing one. So how do you feel about fallout?

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.830
I'm liking it because you know, I was

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.430
Horribly addicted to Skyrim when it came out different series same publisher

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.430
You see a lot of the game mechanics if you didn't Skyrim and oh look it's a video game review show, but

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.070
it is

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.310
Inappropriate to play with my children are around not like Grand Theft Auto inappropriate

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.850
But a little bit too much blood and broken bones sticking out of bodies for 11 year olds me and my 14 year old are

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.910
I figure I'm a couple couple years away from that blood being actually cool and not like disturbing

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.470
So yeah and some again that no judgment are sure some 11 year olds that handle it just fine and

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.110
Understanding wives who let their kids get away with that

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.070
So

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.450
But yeah, I'm enjoying it. I think it's the story like like Bethesda does and again, sorry for the video game review

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.470
It's a story lines fun

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:15.230
There's enough variation in gameplay that it keeps me interested. I play my goal is like I don't play every night

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.730
But if I but like three or four or five days a week, I play a little bit off the kids go to bed

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.870
I try and like gain a level every time

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.390
Which it which means I have to but as you know

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.350
It's the the leveling like most games is get sort of exponential as you go up

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.850
So as you each level took a little harder longer to get to so have you played any from the fallout series before?

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:42.710
No, so but I just I may go out back and do fallout 3 on 360 actually it'll play on

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.430
It now plays on Xbox what Xbox one now comes with fully backwards compatibility to my Xbox 360

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.710
But anyway

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.230
But the point is that full except for all the freaking statement. Go ahead

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:02.030
I was gonna say because I bought fallout 4 I got a free fallout 3. Yep. Yeah, so I'm gonna give it a shot and

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:09.430
Yeah, we'll see I'm enjoying fallout. I'm level 15 now. I think you're up like 20 or something. I'm 25

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.630
Yeah, you're gaining on me. You've been doing you've been doing a little bit more than the level of night then and then though

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.710
I was I know cuz I looked online a while back and you're like 19

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.550
You can you can stalk and see my levels. Yeah, you're in my for my Xbox friends list

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.030
No, I know but you tell us what you do and what level you are. Okay, right with Brit

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.790
It's playing playing Fallout 4 and Xbox one level 9

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:39.570
So I have only leveled up I think twice since we've come back to work. I've only played one day

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.330
Yeah, I was like 22 on Sunday. All right, cool. All right, but it's a great game

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:50.570
But that stuck could get me to at this point in time they could release

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.810
Hey, I knew game crap on a stick. Ooh, okay

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.930
Well, they do

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.710
They have a good game engine a good they put some good thought into their games. Yeah

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.890
I like the non-linearity and they they have done a great job

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:12.170
Doing story development even given a non-linear linear world. Yeah

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.410
So now that we're down to two listeners

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.700
No, no, cuz maybe our three listeners are complete geeks

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.940
Yeah, they probably all have nice floors or we use right

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.660
Do you want to to let's go to two? All right

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.040
so I did a tweet about this want to get your thoughts on this and actually

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.220
When I thought of straw man arguments in the past

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.760
I always thought it's like, you know, you take something out of context and you throw that up there

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.960
But I was looking at the straw man argument Wikipedia page

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.800
I realized there's this thing that bugs me in a lot of writing about software

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:54.060
That's exactly one of the bullet points in a straw man argument where the straw man you throw up is and it makes total sense

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.600
I think about it now this throw up is not the right word. But the straw man argument uses you say something that's

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.740
sort of absurd or

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.060
at least

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:10.170
Incorrect and then you base your article on on on the other end of that and it's all over the place

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:16.810
I see things like most of you think that unit testing is useless. Here's why here's three ways how it can help your team

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.570
wait, most of who or I see things like

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.630
Driving towards driving towards a most of you agree that code coverage is

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:32.070
Useless for most software activities. Let me show you how it can be helpful

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.590
So is this a straw man argument where you make a sweeping?

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.670
Generalization without any no you set yourself up

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.630
There is I forget the name of the fallacy for a sweeping generalization

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.670
Like we talked about this one before and I used to remember it

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.230
But you talked to one manager at Microsoft and he said something goes management at Microsoft says blah

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.560
Like it's a little bit different. I think the straw man is when you you

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.840
Set up the statement you want to say by making an argument that is either out of context or incorrect

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.930
Okay

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:10.610
Because the the challenge I had with your examples is like most of you if the first thing I went to is okay

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.650
What where the hell did you get your data? Yes, and that's what happened. Maybe you're combining often. It's anecdotal

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:22.810
I mean you see this all the time with I see several people who tweet about you know managers aren't enableable to do blah

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.930
This is a little bit out of on the edge of a stretch

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.610
Managers aren't being nice to their employees

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.130
So well which managers will I talk to two managers and they weren't being nice so managers aren't it's like yeah

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.890
But I want to start calling these I want to like make a collection of these for a blog post or something and maybe

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:42.970
It's just me that I noticed them

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.570
But and I find the sites that I don't want to pick on people that'll get mad

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.730
But the sites that sort of crank out articles

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.250
Like their whole idea is just to get crank out these

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:59.690
Half written articles and I say half written because literally they do like two paragraphs and I say more to come next time

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.690
It's all about getting ad

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.890
Getting views for the ads

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:04.730
Yeah

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:10.570
Still they write about 400 words at a time and as the and most of those are set up with some sort of straw man argument

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:18.940
and just and again, I could vote with my feet and stop reading those things, but I do have a lot of blogs and and

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.580
News sites in

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.180
Feedly and I go through most of them every day and kind of glance through them and just looking for

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.300
nuggets of information nuggets of inspiration just to see what's going on and

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.300
So I could just stop reading those and and fix it for myself

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:42.940
But I just wanted to bring it up because I learned I I guess the main thing was I didn't realize that that was

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.860
A form of straw man, but now I think about it. Of course it is so that was my big revelation to share today

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.060
The is that's not quite an Alan Page soapbox rant

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.020
We'll just throw it out there in the new and improved new year

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.990
years ago started blogging and

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.470
It's interesting. It's slowly

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.300
Transforming but a lot of the the reason why I started it is

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.100
Just to get practice at it gave me a reason to practice

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.140
Writing and communication. Yeah, it's funny if you go back and look at my very

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.180
first or very second or third one of my first three blog posts from

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.760
When did I start a long time ago 2006?

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.580
No

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.820
2004 I was still on the Windows CE team the 2004

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.560
Was for that I said for that exact same reason just want to practice writing

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.210
Yeah, and it's it's been helpful for that. But now I play

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.080
different games with my blog like the

00:13:53.170 --> 00:14:00.170
How do I change what I write about or my writing style to inspire

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.220
different

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:11.820
Behaviors, for example you go to Alan will will write a blog. Hey, I read this book and he'll get like 15

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.260
Comments on there to me. I treat comments like gold I

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.420
I

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.660
essentially write a book and

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.600
I know people are looking because I look at the stats and and

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.320
There is a rating page and I get people to

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.200
vote on a rate

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.960
But comments don't show up and I'm I found you have to piss people off a little bit to get them to comment or really

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.080
Yeah, I found I found

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.840
So here's my current acting theory. All right is I need to

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.840
Not cover all bases. I need to create holes

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.640
So that other people can add value

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.320
Yeah, but don't add lines that say more about this next time or I'll talk about that in a future blog post

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.480
Those things drive me crazy. I

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.160
Will do when I bring up a topic. I will do things like

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
Yeah, that's a future blog post

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:19.050
But what I've done once the the the series model

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:24.690
This is part one to be clear. I've done series before as well. But as I I will never do it again one of the things

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.370
That if you read any book about writing

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.970
They'll tell you many great ideas and I can recommend books on writing, but I'm not going to today

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:40.190
But books on writing will tell you one of the best ways to get to be a better writer is to read a lot

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:47.470
And that's true for I think a lot of creative fields when in college when we had our jazz band auditions

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.510
We had a great jazz instructor and a lot of times

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.110
he would listen to you play for a little bit, but he asked who do you listen to and

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:03.010
and make sure you had a good repertoire of artists that were sort of you know relevant and

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.130
you know inspirational at the tip of your tongue to prove that you actually listen to that stuff because

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:12.050
That's one of the ways of getting better at improvising and getting ideas for jazz

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.970
Just to listen more and anybody who's any good, you know

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.150
Yeah, I mean they will tell you everybody to listen to all the time

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.890
And so same thing with reading and one of the things

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.510
looping this back a

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.310
Lot of what I've learned about or what has influenced my own writing style

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:34.790
Is things that I've read and the fact that I get annoyed when I see these half written articles that say more to come

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:41.790
Next time I go you only wrote like a hundred words like I'm exaggerating now, but I realized I never want to do that

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.410
I never want to do that more to come next time and the serious things the same thing because it's

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.750
Although I've done it in the past, you know guilty as I read

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:57.110
More and more of these, you know sound bites of information that we get on the internet these days. I realized that I

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.910
Don't want to read a serious thing

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.670
I want to get the information I want and then if the if the blog if the author is good enough

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.330
I will come back even if it is a series, you know call it a series

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:15.260
Maybe that's better. But you know, I find things I like and don't like in that writing

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.900
I try and reflect some of those things in my own. But as you know, most of my writing is

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.000
Sort of a flurry of conscious like I'm thinking like I want to tweet this I go

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.300
There's no way I can tweet this and like one or two or three tweets. I'll write a couple paragraphs

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.300
I was that your decision?

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.820
What no, so so one big difference between you and I is you're always up on the the Twitter sphere

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.520
I'm up on the Twitter sphere

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.200
Primarily in response to something somebody I'll go up. I will look at Twitter

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:54.160
Three four or five times today just like in between meetings or during lunch or something and I'll catch up and I never like look

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.500
Through like I don't know if anybody does this who follows any number of people I never like go catch up on my tweets

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.460
I'll look at the last dozen or so tweets and if anything I want to reply to I will I may throw something out there

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.460
I may throw something out there. It's a general

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.620
comment to

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.620
many of the tweets that have gone by

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.480
Your I wouldn't say always but I think it's frequent

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.880
well, what I was commented on is that you're

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.840
You're an opener

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.600
far far more often than I am you'll go in and

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.680
Often see rants or often see

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.560
Status updates or things like that. Yeah

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.720
So I completely agree around the more to come it's it's it's not a good device

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.720
So I've tried this

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:48.620
But it it depends it is a good device if the entire goal is to get viewers to your site to get ad money

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.770
Sure, that's not a problem. I'm interested in

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.970
Solving in Mike. No me neither

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:02.690
But for me the that when I use the device it is often when I'm writing something I've realized

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:09.850
Hey the rationale for the thing. I just wrote could actually be an entire other blog post

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:15.900
I'm just gonna say hey this could be a similar lines if this could be another blog maybe one day

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:21.420
I'll write up on it. I leave it to the reader to go do their own research. Otherwise

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.180
Trust me. This is the reason why I said this

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:30.020
Moving on because as we all well know I am riddled with ADHD

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.520
And if I were to follow that thread that's going to be a hotter page block

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.180
so

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.920
You hear that sound? That's the sound of a

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.210
Beating of a dead horse Wow, so

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.970
But on the same subject

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:50.530
You wrote a blog post recently about combined engineering

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.930
Yes, the that the Jive chosen to call unified engineering

00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:00.410
But for various reasons to cover before but if you haven't read it go to

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.570
Testastic dot WordPress dot com and

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:12.930
Nice lengthy tough for the ADHD crowd to get through that. I took me two sittings. Why why was it long? Oh

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.170
Yeah, that's lots of paragraphs

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.200
Words and words and words

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.960
Yeah, I have been told

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.280
that one of my communication problems is

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:34.010
Is I often choose to say in ten words what can be said in three wasn't is it Mark Twain that said I was going

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.930
To write you a short letter, but I didn't have time. So I wrote you a long one instead

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.680
Yeah, no, and you know what that sounds funny, but I completely totally understand that

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.980
Anybody who's done any writing totally would

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:56.100
Speaking of long words total rant when did people start using the word utilize instead of use?

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:05.570
I'm going to it's like little five-year-olds good. I'm going to utilize a blue crayon to draw this. I think that's when

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.590
When synthesis kind of got out of favor in terms of management buzzwords

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.920
excellent

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.980
So

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:24.100
Good blog post one thing. I don't think you meant to imply this but one thing that you know when you read

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:31.180
There are techniques on reading and I and if there's like something that bothers you it ends up distracting you from comprehension

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.180
One of the reasons I read this twice because in the very first or second paragraph

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:41.340
I don't think you intended it but you sort of made you sound like that unified engineering was invented in Bing and

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:49.090
And to be clear that there are teams doing an engineering team without separation of development and test no

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.730
It's you know as you it which I'm sure you'll agree with many many other companies

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:59.050
I think one of the first places that Microsoft if not the first place at Microsoft that to happen was over in the Bing team

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.010
So I will say

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.780
and

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.060
They spent some time trying to because the way I worded that first

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.340
Definitely implied it and I didn't want to do that

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.820
However, here's here's what I'll say the foundations of the model

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:26.460
Were not invented in Bing or in Microsoft. Absolutely not it was

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.540
Much like other companies do and they watch

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.580
Microsoft to see what they're doing like we know for example

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.860
Amazon is like 10 years is following the model we did 10 years ago and it's

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:45.600
You know, that's to be clear I wouldn't say that wholeheartedly there's some bits of the model

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.740
Following is probably too hard

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:52.620
But what happens is Amazon has gotten a lot of X Microsoft ease and they've taken what they've used

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.180
For better or for worse, right? I think

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.180
It depends on your point of view. I

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.900
Think for Amazon for worse if you're a competitor of Amazon for better one thing

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.900
I'm gonna interrupt because that's what we do on this podcast

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:15.900
But one thing it's I like about what I hear about Amazon culture is they have these company values that come up daily in

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.980
Meetings like they actually live their company values. I'm gonna ask you name one of Microsoft's company values

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.100
Point point made. All right, go on. Yeah

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.180
We used to do that actually

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.100
Then the first decade of my career. I mean remember having lots of discussions around

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.780
Our competencies in a line

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.420
Yeah, we'd have brainstorming meetings and the line discussions to our competencies, which was

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.120
that's the most recent version of

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:57.000
Values that I've actually paid attention to that's old but to your thing. No, it wasn't invented but

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.870
There was a very I mean it

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:09.170
How to do this model other companies have done before right the specific variant

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.220
And the specific set of documentation

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:23.300
That got deployed at Microsoft did initiate. Yeah, but I'm being honestly and this could be a huge rat hole

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:30.640
I don't think the initial and it rarely is it but I don't think the initial implementation for people I've talked to of

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.080
unifying engineering

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.520
Was particularly successful in being

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.750
And let me give you some anecdotal stories and again

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.630
It was a large part of the group that a lot of people I've talked to

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:52.350
I feel like I'm like to have looped Brent into this like I'm ready Charlie Rose sort of interrogation

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.460
so

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.620
Anecdotally, I've known a lot of people in that org

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.160
I've heard following statements

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.440
Managers were surprised that by making everybody a developer that

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:14.220
Throughput didn't increase reflectively. I heard that multiple people

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:20.060
I also heard that you know a lot of the but probably more believable was that in that move

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.820
This is one of the things talked about and things that fail is a lot of

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
People were valued on

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.120
feature

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:37.000
Feature output in production and then a lot of the testing activities although necessary were valued less or not done

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.290
so

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.770
That so the first one I never heard

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.900
Okay in terms of a throughput a

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:52.160
Theoretical throughput tests that failed I had I I've talked again. I was in Bing. I talked to a lot of folks

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.340
Yeah, you never heard your knowledge is a little better than mine mine's a second hand, but I

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.620
Think you learn there the second one. I mean that by far

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.240
the

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.620
the biggest

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.620
double-quote surprise

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:14.980
was that quality fell and that I did hear a lot and

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:23.100
The the focus on features now that is one of the things I

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.620
experienced two different models the the model

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:35.660
That they deployed in Bing. Okay. Now was their first attempt and not only that so they started off with one specific team

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.840
And that one specific team worked very well, and then they very rapidly broadened it

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.420
the

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:49.100
Thing that I believe that they did an error is they had the right thing, but they had the wrong

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.940
principles and goals that they were trying to accomplish things like

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.860
throughput or

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.900
Efficiency, okay

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.900
Several of these things and it occurred to me. I actually had a mentee the other day

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:13.410
Come to me and he started talking about combined engineering and I'm like I

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:19.490
Had just written my blog three days ago at that time and I'm like, did you read my blog?

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.970
Is that why you're here? He's like you blog

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:27.850
And I'm like and that happens quite a read this and come back that that happens quite a lot

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.200
I don't I don't I

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.950
Don't understand that phenomenon

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.950
but

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:40.230
There was that experience in Bing and the and the learnings and the mistakes and then after after about a year and a half

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.750
I went to a different team and

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:49.690
They wanted to go with this model and they had learned that I was there. So I helped to instruct it

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:58.250
The biggest thing that I realized that I left out of my blog was

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.610
very specific common things people do

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.270
That they should not

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.840
As an example, you should although this is one I called out

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.080
one of the mistakes that they did is they wanted to do the combined engineering and

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:23.210
They said that they valued the test expertise as much as the feature expertise, but their actions and their words

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.530
were not

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:30.020
With strong integrity of each other. I believe it

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.600
right

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.920
but

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.260
the teams

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.260
Where their actions in the words lined up?

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.300
Succeeded with the unified engineering model

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.060
They recognized

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:50.740
But it comes down to there's this prevailing subversive belief that that the prior test team

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.940
Didn't add value and never did the only value that they had is now

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.590
Those guys would do my testing for me

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.620
right and actually we

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.300
we served a

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.140
stronger purpose than that and those teams that that

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.310
Realized that became stronger

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.660
In in actuality. Well, I think we talked about this loss

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.470
last time

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.230
What I am finding is

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:28.030
The teams that go whole hog into unified engineering

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:34.060
with with a respect both points of view and have the

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.620
leadership run by

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.280
the test

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:44.720
they're actually shaping up to be stronger than the prior and I think it's because

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.480
tests had a strength with respect to

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:56.380
Balancing quality and features. All right, we always were for the the one month test pass at the end

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.460
We were always only given two weeks. So we had to be able to do a good ROI

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:09.900
to prevent someone coming in yelling at us and blaming us for the quality at the end and

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.650
Also, I think test is inherently

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.410
Better at doing the generalist

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:24.600
To in between shift. I agree. I agree. Hey real quick. Yeah one thing you didn't touch on your blog

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:31.800
I'm curious to know your answers on is what are a couple things that you definitely don't want to do when you have a unified engineering team

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.600
Well, I think I just touched on one. Yeah, right. Well, let's give it some more

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.500
It's easy to mess up, right? So just give you a couple quick if that have ever happened to you

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.500
But well a couple examples

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:53.170
Ideas you notions you don't want to have the incentive principles

00:30:53.810 --> 00:31:00.240
Be of the old world. You mean like features or what was right? You don't you don't

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.940
It's a new team. It's a new concept

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.330
you don't want to try to figure out how to

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.370
Take these new guys from that discipline and

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:19.290
Now rank them through the world that you're used to you have you have to change

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:25.490
The worldview so one of the things I do think I I glanced over

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:28.330
The incentive structure has to change

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.020
So how do you incentivize people?

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.100
What what what is the right? What is a right?

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.460
What is something what do you do to incentivize people in the right way in a unified engineer?

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.820
I'm gonna hand wave on on this one, but it's

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.750
You need to

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.110
value

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:59.640
throughput and quality and you don't stack rank those two it's

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.040
No, it's the you've heard the phrase the tyranny of or it's not an or

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.140
Yeah, you can't provide me ten features

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:15.980
With a quality level one and call a win. No, right, but and you can't just in the unified engineering team

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.650
You can't just the other thing you can't have

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:25.560
Is a caste system you cannot

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.570
Create

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.540
This new

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:37.460
Unified engineering team that that in my view is what makes a difference between a combined engineering team and unified engineering team

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.180
Ah, good point and I love the analogy in the blog about salad dressing

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:48.540
Yeah, so and I've seen this before well has seen well my feature team is unified engineering team. That is scrum team

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.540
On my feature team, you know so and so and I are the testers. We do the testing for everyone else

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.080
That's our role on the scrum team

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.680
Brad just oh, you know what? I saw this in big bang three last night. You could actually hear someone's eyes roll. Yeah

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500
Especially when I watched that last night as well

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.220
the

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.820
the one of the problems that my mentee has

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.380
is

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.310
Was that it was was that issue?

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.020
So his expertise his strengths

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.310
were in

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.830
infrastructure test automation

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.390
in the in

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:34.230
Testing okay. Yeah, that was a value proposition and I said that's fantastic, right?

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.940
Until it's unified we need to operate on the assumption. It's only combined

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.660
unless you have a

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:51.120
An insightful a smart manager who realized no, I'm gonna start with the beginning or the with the end this I'm gonna

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.040
I'm gonna act like my team is already the team I want. Okay

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:02.750
But they were overly focused on their strengths and I'm like if you do that and

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.940
I'm not gonna mention the team

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:13.550
But I did mentioned. So here's the thing. I actually think that you're on a team that

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.820
Probably isn't going to exist for a long time

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:26.340
Right. It's one of these teams where we're experimenting with things and I don't think the experiment has succeeded

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.310
so

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:35.210
The rest of Microsoft is moving towards this model and if you don't start to transition

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:42.380
Yourself if you focus on only your strengths if my prediction comes true

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.380
You're not gonna find a job

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:53.020
Because you're gonna be two years behind everybody else in terms of their learning of how to be able to do both successfully

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.600
Yeah, and one thing to be clear on I was afraid of making this point

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:01.000
I agree, but I was afraid of making this point earlier why I hemmed and hawed a little bit but

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:08.680
When I look at a team, of course, it's quality focus. It's collaboration. I are some things I care about

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.440
output and

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.380
Maybe technical ability I might throw in there

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.460
But I'm looking at how I'm going to and that was a little iffy but the first three for sure

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.220
So collaboration thing is really important. I want to reward the

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:30.740
People who work together and enable others much better, especially at higher levels of Microsoft. I also want

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.110
output and

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.510
but clearly by output

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:43.950
One trap to fall into is that output includes customer facing features only so I want to

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:50.700
So output is are you getting work done and maybe maybe another one is business impact

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.180
So I'm gonna look at if I'm looking at my team. I want to figure out and again, it's not stack

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:59.380
I can figure out who wants to get the most rewards. It's not tyranny of war, but I'm looking at

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.860
You know who has a great combination of working with others

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.380
Gets

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.060
Relevant work done. So they get a lot of work done to that work

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:14.380
We've seen people get a lot of work done but none of that work is actually applicable to anything we care about

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.520
People go off on these science projects forever, but I can't you know, those people are people I cannot reward

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.880
but if you're doing a lot of work and it may not be feature work, but if you're like enabling the team like I

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.890
want to look at someone if I'm

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:34.410
Cranking out I'm making sure that this infrastructure works to make it very easy for devs to check into a CI system and get data

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:40.370
Out and and make decisions very very quickly, etc. Etc. Even if I never write a customer facing feature

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:45.690
They're doing a ton of output on relevant work and they're helping other people

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:50.650
So although they haven't done a customer facing feature, they may be one of my most valued employees

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Sesinctly like I have the same bar

00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.480
Sesinctly the way I and then I order it for me. What's important first and foremost

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:08.880
Validated ROI that you delivered something that was validated as ROI. It drives me bonkers

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.880
That there's a lot of folks highly successful at

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.060
Hand-waving and saying oh look at all the awesomeness that we did

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:29.600
When all they did was ship well ship in two weeks later you you you got two people using it

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.360
I'm like no you didn't deliver ROI

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Okay, ROI business ROI delivering business ROI is absolutely my first one. The second one is absolutely team collaboration

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.440
Hero is a four-letter word. I

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:50.040
Cannot any longer stand siloism there. We've talked about a blog

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.340
Before or we did a podcast before

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.640
There is a place for heroes, but in general

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:04.060
They're not used in that fashion that we've discussed before and in general they drive me bonkers

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.460
And often the hero is ends up being a bottleneck

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.820
It almost always does we'll be fine as soon as the hero comes in and saves us saves the day

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.140
and then

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.140
So it was ROI

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:25.620
Collaboration and then lastly is throughput if I can get these first two principles

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:31.420
throughput is easy to turn the crank up on when when they try to do throughput first and

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.620
They abandoned the others two principles then things go into the weeds. That's my experience

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.880
It was great to have a mail-in mailbag item from you Alan

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:51.170
Yeah, we forget to do the mailbag when it's a question from each of us. Yeah, I don't think it really counts

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.190
so

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.990
One thing one last thing. Yeah is I should probably talk about is

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:02.550
Came back from the break after the holiday on Monday. We're having a meeting. We had a little bit of a

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.510
Architectural reset on my team

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:11.270
We're gonna change our back end and we're talking about how to get that going and we're having this discussion and and this is totally

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:15.790
Out of context, but one of the and I tweeted this and maybe I should just read read the tweet

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.870
This is words removed and paraphrased to fit in 140 characters

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.350
But basically what happened is I I said this

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:29.190
Peer manager said today that his current plan was to quote not worry about tests and quality

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.590
Well, his team got their features done, you know

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:36.070
I wrote hashtag last words and just a little bit of event for me and kind of you know, it's

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:42.510
Kind of funny, but it's like 20 some odd retweets and then 12 likes of that

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:46.130
Well that struck a nerve or people thought it was pathetic or something

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.720
but and then

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:54.000
There are some follow-ups on that or so there's some context where I think he meant the right thing and and we had a long

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.720
We had a talk afterwards and a couple talks afterwards

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.520
One where I told him he should be fired but

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.960
He took it well

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:12.120
So the point is is when in the world and again he didn't use those exact words, but

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:18.630
Why do smart people this is our I think our smartest dev manager. Why do smart people?

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.010
Say dumb things

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:28.480
To me that's a very easy answer you think it's an easy answer I think it's complicated

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.740
What's your easy answer? No, so it's it's it's broad enough

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.820
that I could easily see your typical answer for these type of things of

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400
It depends would apply

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:47.180
So but I actually think I can answer it with an equivalently broad answer

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:53.360
Oh, I can't wait go the answer is I'm letting it even say always

00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.770
the wrong combination of fear and hope that is

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.520
Always the answer. So let me go a little bit more specific smart people do dumb things because they're not using their smartness

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:15.920
They're not analyzing. They're using an emotion. Yeah, motion is always there influenced by context and largely emotion and

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.240
One of the things I learned a few years ago. I spent some time

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.080
I don't have time for the long story

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:28.000
I will tell it anyway in the brief form used to be a thing we did at Microsoft called an MS 360 where

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.120
If you get up to hire their own leadership ish levels

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.720
They one of the things you can do is this thing called the 360 where they take people from all over the company

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.560
You've worked with people that work for you. You work for you work with you work outside of your org and they fill out

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:53.200
This extensively long survey about you and just to kind of get feedback on kind of how you're perceived around people and I grew

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.600
up in the Microsoft of you know

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.280
Steamroll take names and you know, if you leave bodies in your wake, it's cool

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.920
so those are my mentors my first like 10 years at Microsoft and

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:11.660
That's where the good attrition comes from and we know people that still try and act like that and where I made a big turning

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.180
This 360 and I met with HR and you know because they

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:21.300
Still people as part in that I know and they're idiots as part of this

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.940
It was kind of eye-opening because I felt like I was doing good

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:31.340
I was emulating my mentors and and I was having a great time and being a dick and

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:39.600
Part of this is the ad like a one-on-one with some HR person talking to you about stuff and and they go holy cow

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.540
Alan everyone you work with loves you. They think you're fantastic. They also think you're an asshole

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.750
Yeah

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.750
So it was like oh

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.490
Is that good or bad?

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:57.050
So I ended up because what I do is what I want to improve it something I study the crap out of it

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.970
So I read like a half a dozen books on interpersonal awareness, which a lot of people hand wave as oh

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.850
I need to be nice to people and that is the most shallow

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.570
It's like it's like to loop this background at the beginning

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:13.370
It's like learning just enough of the force where you go off on the dark side and become an income a jerk

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:21.430
I would say if you wanted to do a broad generalization, it's not be nice to people. It's no it's understand. No, it's understanding

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:29.390
How you're coming across as well as what other people are saying it's a different you need to concentrate on perception and learning about things

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.510
Yeah, so when I see someone anytime like that's really stupid

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:39.810
But and a lot of times like I used to like flip the bozo bit like you said something stupid. You're an idiot

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:44.090
I'm never taking anything you say at face value again because you're an idiot

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:49.370
But I look at and I assume for the most part if someone especially someone's fairly senior

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:57.250
They're a smart person and with this guy. He's a smart person thinking why would he say that and it's about context and the context

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.250
Is is he had some fear?

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.410
About you know getting things up and running

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:06.570
We have a lot of dependencies like in order to get the site up and running on the new back end like it

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:12.570
We need to get you know level stage D or E running before we could actually dog food on it

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:19.250
It's depending on ABC and D and he's thinking well if I am blocking these five other things down the road

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:24.490
The important thing is get them unblocked first and then if I have to make some shortcuts, I will

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.720
But once he said that I said oh, I'm actually okay with that

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:35.120
I'm actually I'm all for do not skimp on adding unit tests. Do not skimp on code review not skip any of this stuff

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.480
If when push comes to shove you want to take a little shortcut

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.480
I'm not saying right crap throw away code

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:47.680
But if all you're saying is sometimes gonna take shortcuts in order to unblock someone then you go back and do that work by all

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.080
Means that's okay cuz unblocking I think is very important

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.480
But I want to be exception rather than the rule but even then once you unblock

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:03.800
Then you immediately have absolutely and and and he was okay with that but though he was looking at it from the I

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.760
You know, I look at things that

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:12.540
We wanted the goal is quality. We're not we're never going to ship if we don't think of quality first, but

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.080
sometimes

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.360
There's no rule that I can think of that's written in stone

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:23.200
This is you have to follow every single time you can bend these things for a reason when I was in college

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:29.400
It was great. I took this and I mean I'm on my talent chair had music theory for two straight years of music theory every morning

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.810
exciting, huh and

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:38.490
We spent the first four or five four and a half quarters of that like learning rules the rule of fifths

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:45.250
That's like day one. So it learned rules and rules and rules and rules is Kate now, you know the rules now

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:49.650
You can break them not allowed to break the rules till you understand the rules. Yes

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.610
So that works a lot. So anyway, that's important

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:59.850
That's like the first lesson that I teach and is broken in a true with agile as well, huh?

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:06.650
Learn the rules that there's probably a blog post in there. Yeah more next time. So there's two two

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:13.030
For lack of a better word I'll say wisms that I pass on that's real

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.680
Relevant to this when mentees come to me first and foremost

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:29.640
Everybody is awesome. It's their behavior set piss us all very very well put just because I like that nugget

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.160
Just because you think they're a dumbass

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:39.580
More than likely it just means their worldview is different than yours. Now there could be behaviors

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.760
that are

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.240
The oil and vinegar with your behaviors, but it doesn't mean that their worldview is

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:56.010
Necessarily invalid. Okay, this is one of the things that were why I love strength finders as a framework because it gives me insight into

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.810
Okay, this behavior is really pissing me off

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.370
how do they look at the world that would explain this behavior and

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.320
which enables me to

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:14.220
Then go have a conversation say, okay, how do I suggest a behavioral change because these people are awesome

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.260
I want them in this party. I want them part of the team

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:23.400
But I can't live with how they're doing this behavior wait the second wisdom

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.310
This is something that I've learned

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:31.900
It's not always true, but it is true. So friggin awesome or not awesome

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.160
Often that it is awesome

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.160
and that is

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.980
in general

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.980
though the worst things people do

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:54.920
The behaviors that they do to screw up their own lives is because they are operating out of a fear and they don't

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:02.220
Often even realize it the best thing people who are observing this like you go you go Wow this guy

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:08.600
Normally really smart. He does does does these things really well, but this thing this thing he's doing

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.440
Which is completely wrong is also

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.580
Uncharacteristically

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.340
Part of his behavior said this is a new pattern

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:24.560
This is something I've never seen this guy do before and I will tell you 80% of the time

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:31.400
It's because they're afraid of something even if they are claiming they aren't so two quick things before we close today is

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.680
Two things come to mind both from books. I read a lot huge number of books

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.120
Jerry Weinberg said on multiple occasions. I don't know what book or whether

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.440
It was somewhere else, but it's actually I do know a book is from but I can't remember the name

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.000
Doesn't matter

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.200
It's always a people problem

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.280
Which is true, but what is even better and I really think it's important if you have to work with people

00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:00.510
You need to actually work at it the same as you work at your code

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:05.150
If you're a consultant, especially or a sort of leader as much as you work on your technical skills

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:10.790
You need to work on how you deal with people just as much and maybe more if you're behind the curve

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:13.990
Michael Lop wrote a book called

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.750
Managing humans, which is very very good

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.950
There's a whole chapter on FUD fear uncertainty and doubt and how to deal with that in your organization

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:26.950
Which is you know right along these same lines and you need to be able to handle that you need to understand that

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:30.310
You know people have weird behaviors. They're gonna act differently

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:37.650
You need to learn if you really want to manage someone or lead someone you need to take time and effort effort

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.150
Especially to kind of figure out where they're coming from what drives them

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.990
There's a motivation that makes people say silly things or do dumb things

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:52.790
there's a motivation that made this dev manager say we're gonna make shortcuts and I real demand like this to make the shortcuts for the

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.230
exception rather than the rule and and

00:49:56.150 --> 00:50:00.590
Working with people is a lot about compromises not about setting hard rules and making people

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:06.630
You know strictly adhere to them and you and I have both known test managers throughout our career that say this is the way

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:11.310
It's gonna be and you know, I'm in my own quality and these are the rules

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:16.410
But you you could have rules. We also have to understand that sometimes in

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:23.510
Making progress I was once I I was that test manager once

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:28.030
I'm glad you grew up Brent it and it did not go well

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.800
It was the single most important learning lesson in my career

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:39.370
Very cool. We could go on and on on this thing is a good subject to explore more next time just kidding

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:46.170
But our three listeners are tired and probably want to get off to bed. Yes. All right, so happy new year

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:50.130
Happy new year. Everybody will be back with episode 34 next time I am

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:54.880
possibly Alan as am I

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.040
Later bye guys
