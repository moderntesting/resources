00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.870
Hey everyone and hello Brent.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.030
Hi Alan, how are you doing?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.030
I'm doing great.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.070
I am actually feeling excellent given the fact that I just flew in from Reykjavik last

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.070
night.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.910
Landed around 6pm.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.320
And what foreign country is this in?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.320
Dude, you have the geography knowledge of an American.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.880
You know, someone's got to keep the stereotype alive.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.440
The Reykjavik is the capital of Iceland.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.200
Oh cool.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.000
I knew it was the biggest city in Iceland and I knew Iceland didn't have that many people

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.780
but I wasn't prepared for how small Reykjavik is.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780
What could I compare it to?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.140
I was thinking about that the whole flight home.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.700
I took a picture so I could think about it some more.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
I don't know what the population is, I'm not going to look it up.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.340
One of the three can do that.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.600
But I was like in the tallest building in Reykjavik with 8 story hotel.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
Cool.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.800
And it is small.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.840
I don't have a good comparison.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.910
It is amazing how, this is probably too philosophical for our podcast, but I find it amazing how

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.870
life always seems to find a way.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.870
It does man.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.950
Right, you're in the middle of, there's multiple middles of nowhere where suddenly communities

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310
just start popping up.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.870
Yep, yep, yep.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.110
Hey, I was in, I got to do the right segue slash pin here because I was there for a meeting

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.790
with my manager and my peers to talk about people and how they're doing, go over some

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.950
strategy stuff, basically a two and a half day off site.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.600
Probably the best off site of my entire career.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.050
Was there candy?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.610
Yes, in the form of fermented grapes and a glass.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.170
Oh, well there you go.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.650
Not only are we super aligned on what we're doing, I mean, if there's one thing I could

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.770
go to improve the last three days, was I'm a big believer that great innovation, actually

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.930
this happened at one time, that breakthroughs happened from disagreement and having an argument

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.250
people you trust, it's okay to have that argument.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.730
I think great things come from that.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.930
Now that I think back, one of the great insights we had and the thing, this idea

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.470
that just exploded upon us as a few things converged, did come from argument.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.510
So, wow, it was great.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.710
But one thing during the people discussion, I want to pin, because something came up that's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.470
highly related to the principle we're going to discuss today.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.470
Okay.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.830
So I'm going to go make a note on that on the whiteboard so I don't forget where we keep

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.830
our notes.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.550
And then, Phil Miam, what have you been up to since the last recording of A-B testing?

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.430
Oh, by the way, A-B testing is ...

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.430
One of the things on my backlog is to actually record a proper intro.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.390
I think I'm going to change the music and do a proper, fancy podcast intro.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.230
I don't approve of changing the music.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.030
Okay, I'll figure something out.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.460
I got to figure out how to ... I want to do a proper intro for A-B testing so I don't

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.220
forget to say crap and we can just start off talking about crap.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.750
Are you going to do your best practiced DJ radio voice?

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.590
A-B testing.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830
A-B testing, let me tell you.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.830
Wow!

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.270
No, no, I will do something though.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.310
Anyway, if this is your first episode, probably not the best place to start.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.670
Although if you want to listen, go ahead, because we're talking about modern testing

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.670
principles out of the podcast.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.430
We talk a lot about software development, software quality, software testing, Agile

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.670
software, leadership, management, bunnies and squirrels, and this thing we've been

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.830
talking about for the last, holy crud, like six months, eight months, a year, year and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.830
a half?

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.830
At least a year.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.830
A thing called modern testing.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.950
And modern testing isn't modern in the sense that it's flying cars, it's just modern

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.670
as compared to traditional testing.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.710
Anyway, I'm going to let you read the back of the Kim Koehner book while I go

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.710
put a note on the board.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.270
So, Brent, what have you been up to?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.100
Nothing much.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.100
Okay.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.100
Yeah.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.100
All right.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.660
There is very little excitement in my life at the moment baseball season's done.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.660
You mentioned that last time.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.660
Yeah, I know.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.660
You've talked about this before.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.660
Agreed.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.340
Things I can't talk about, I mean, there is a lot of really exciting stuff happening

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.340
on the work front.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.340
Yeah, I got some of that too.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.180
Well, at least in mind I can chat with you a little bit about after we stop

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.180
recording.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.180
Yep.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.230
And you probably have secret stuff because you work at a big secret company.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.910
I'm sure you have secrets too.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.910
I do.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.910
I do.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.910
I have plenty of secrets.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.910
Oh, I have stories to tell.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.270
Yeah, I can't bring them up now.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.750
But anyway, sorry about that.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.070
So your trip to Iceland, was that a work trip or a?

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.990
Were you listening to me?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.190
We just had a three day off site in Iceland.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.580
Oh, right.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.900
No, I generally don't listen to you.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.900
Holy fudge sickles.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.340
Man, what's the name of the podcast?

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.020
It's the 88th episode of A.B.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.020
Testing.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.060
And why don't we just dive right in to the seventh of the modern testing

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.060
principles.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.060
Is that cool?

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.060
That's cool.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.060
All right.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.580
You can read modern testing principles on modern testing dot org.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.420
And this is maybe a record and that we're only about six minutes in once I edit out

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.500
Brent's brain farts.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.880
And we are actually talking about the topic of the day, which is fantastic because we

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.320
have a whiteboard full of notes.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:03.160
OK, number seven is the one that to me is becoming less and less controversial.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.880
Just absolutely makes sense.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.640
But it still causes a few heads to turn.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.020
What do you mean to you is less your observation is no.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:19.000
In my context, it's like it's making where it made sense before it is rock, freakin solid.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.840
You could not convince me to back off on the second part of this one, which is the

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.040
part that people see as controversial.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.960
No, we're going to dive into that.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.240
I feel like I'm talking around it.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.360
Let me read it and then we'll talk about crap.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.120
You have a place you want to start from notes on the board so we can get now start with

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.120
reading the principle.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.520
OK, here we go.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.700
Principle number seven.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.680
We expand testing abilities and know how across the team, understanding that this may

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.640
reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.320
So with this principle, we can focus on the first half and this ties in with principle

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.400
number four about the quality culture and driving the quality culture on the team.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.200
But where this one is different, this is about for me, make sure on the same page

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200
here.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.240
This one's about making sure the team knows the test approaches, test techniques.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:17.020
They know teaching them that bugs lurk around boundaries, teaching them how to design chips

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.420
for designing test automation.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.180
Let me take a different approach.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.620
OK, let's just take the controversy head on.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.780
But I dude, I said let's take care of the first part first.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.660
We can talk about why the controversy isn't controversial most of the episode.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.100
But what is the essence of how does this maybe you're going to get to this.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.300
But I am all right.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.580
I'm going to let you go.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.460
But you kind of principle seven.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.460
Yes.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:53.260
So the question to me is essentially it's the final straw in I think the modern testing.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.700
Well it's the final principle in the modern testing principles.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:05.230
But the observant amongst the most observant readers of the modern testing principles will

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:11.610
notice that we don't actually address testing until principle seven.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.110
That is true.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:25.480
And what principle seven is essentially stating is the modern tester doesn't test.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480
In a way.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480
In a way.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480
Yeah.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.280
Because again I stand by our statement that modern testing is a transient role.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.640
I'm sorry a modern tester is a transient role.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.660
Meaning they are someone who helps the team adopt modern testing principles.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:48.980
So for me essentially what number seven says is everything else above is executed so well

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.760
and the quality culture does cover some testing as well.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:57.300
But the team understands testing well enough across the team spread throughout the team

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.110
that they may not need that dedicated testing specialist.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.110
It's a culmination.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.510
There's purposeful and developed and careful overlap between the principles.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.710
They build on each other both sequentially and randomly.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.870
But number seven as you mentioned it's the pinnacle.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.310
It says if you are a team following modern testing principles and I remember modern testing

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.070
isn't about testing as much as it's about how you approach quality in software development.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.390
It's modern testing as opposed to traditional testing.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:34.250
And if you follow those principles and the team gets what testing and quality are you

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.450
may not need a dedicated testing specialist and that makes perfect sense.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:45.170
I think in this episode you're going to be playing good cop the entire time.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.210
Therefore I will play back up.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.490
One of the comments one of the pieces of feedback I've seen a lot of people will read

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.370
number seven and run the risk of bit flipping the whole modern testing principles.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.570
I agree.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.920
And saying oh my God.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.720
Brent and Alan are just on the same.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.720
They will say we don't respect the craft.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.240
Or no we're on the same meme.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.480
This is what I'm talking about the same test is dead meme.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:22.870
And one of the things I want to say is that I'm actually we're not saying that.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:33.960
I have said I think it's on its way and the thing that I will say is in this particular

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:43.830
case you can you can either be the butterfly or you can be the wind.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:52.430
So those who interpret this as a test is dead message and respond from fear like the one

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:59.130
thing I will say on that front is like first off fear actually isn't real.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.930
This is super philosophical but fear isn't real.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:07.410
It's about what might be not what is.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:14.490
And so the intent on this one going back to the first half of your of the principle

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.930
is like no you can control your own destiny.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:26.610
If you if you understand the prior six principles you will understand that your job and your

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:34.810
business is better suited by you taking up the role and spreading the knowledge of how

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.930
to do the testing activity.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:44.330
And as that testing activity is spread throughout your organization not only will the business

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:51.510
benefit but one of the consequences a testing specialist just won't be needed.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.910
One of the things I've noticed from those who dig in their heels and say this is who may

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:01.590
reject this principle or modern testing principles because of this principle is there is a belief

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:07.270
among many in testing and I'll interject and get my stack correct.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:15.350
I am happily blown away by how many people agree this is the right direction or tell me

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.870
we're already doing this.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.750
Thanks for putting a name for what we're doing.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.070
It is not some fad that you it's not an echo chamber of you and I talking about this

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.070
thing.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.070
It is actually happening.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.830
It was happening without us.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.630
We are just trying to put names to the things we see that are happening and encourage others

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.790
to go in this direction.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:40.390
So the fear or the worry I see the biggest thing that comes to me from people who are

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:50.440
digging their heels in on no is they believe that testing skills are a unique thing that

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.870
is only learnable and practiceable by people with a unique mindset and people that do

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.950
specific areas of practice and they believe that they are I don't want to say special

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:07.790
snowflakes you may but they believe they are uniquely suited to software testing and that

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:14.350
skill that the developers programmers of code do not have the right air quote mindset to

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:20.870
do testing and what I've found what what shifted me over this direction was I found

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:28.140
that teaching developers to test was not only not that hard it was fun for me and it

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:34.500
was fun for the developers I worked with I have done this now on three different teams

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.700
and indirectly so now I went through two teams of teaching developers to test and now I am

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.380
teaching people to teach developers to test and it is it works developers can learn to

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:53.100
test it isn't a unique unteachable skill that needs to be done by a dedicated specialist

00:13:53.180 --> 00:14:00.780
you know I've been doing this now for so long I'm beginning to forget what it was like when

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:11.390
I held that belief like to me is just absolutely clear in my mind that testing is an activity

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:20.880
and not a job yes right and for me from a business point of view it's a testing activity

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:33.550
that dev not only should and can but must do and when I say must I mean there are so

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:42.560
many product related benefits by getting dev on this you end up with a much better design

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.760
of the product there's accountability and ownership they're like oh yeah I thought of this test

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.720
I want to do this test but accountability ownership just quite honestly I'm gonna say

00:14:53.720 --> 00:15:00.200
that those are useless criteria I don't think so when people think of something themselves

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.970
they want to do it more the biggest problem I have with accountability this is an aside

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:10.570
the biggest problem I have our podcast we're all yeah the biggest problem I have with

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:17.140
the term accountability is that so I have pay attention to simultaneously the word choices

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:24.200
people use and then I pay attention to the actions that are associated with those word

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:30.360
choices and what I've come to conclude is that when people the majority of people use

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.280
the term accountability what its purpose in life is is to publicly identify who to blame

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:42.370
when it all goes to shit and I don't care about that no I care more about self accountability

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.050
I'm not talking I'm not talking about yeah I'm talking about self accountability when

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.050
I mentioned that so yeah I don't like that either the I don't even associate that word

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:55.850
that way anymore so the way I would phrase it slightly differently is that once the devs

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:05.440
understand this they realize holy crap it's actually not as hard as they thought right

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.300
because actually at this point in time the testing has been around for so long there

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:18.740
are multiple devs that have been in the in their arena or in their discipline for decades

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:26.260
that have never actually owned testing and so to them it's this mysterious burden but

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:32.780
when they realize when it gets demystified what you find is that no it's a benefit to

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:38.810
them because it allows them to control their own destiny allows them to reduce surprises

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:45.050
at the end of the milestone it allows them to control you know how many sleepless nights

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:51.930
and weekends are working and gain confidence that when they did their check in it's done

00:16:51.930 --> 00:17:01.360
and it's not coming back yes right and so these are these are all strong benefits to to

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:07.600
the actual developer whether it informs you know creates accountability or ownership I don't

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.360
know that that's really important but what I do find from the human condition what people

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.560
want is to control their own destiny and that's exactly what I'm talking about right

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.760
they want to be the wind they don't want to be the butterfly yeah and I could reiterate

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:26.600
and say exactly what I'm talking about so we yeah I want to tell a meta story about

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.520
modern testing it's going to lead into this okay I realize that I have to it's actually

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:37.490
going to be beneficial to tell the meta story so of course I talk about modern testing a

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:42.450
lot on this podcast I have never once gone to my team and say here is modern testing

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:47.730
is what we're gonna do some listen to the podcast hey everyone they go yeah we want

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:54.690
to do modern testing but what I do on my team instead is make sure that the principles

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.690
not in name like follow this principle but it guides what we do and we've been focusing

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:07.770
a lot recently on the quality culture and and not just on my team across all of unity

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:14.940
one of the things we discussed in our offsite last week is how our people in QA our testers

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.480
they are accountable and to use that word again for nurturing as we say in principle

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.320
number four that quality culture yep and we talk about the quality culture a lot and

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.120
people and they get that everybody everybody all of unity QA is on board with yes we

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.040
need to improve the quality culture and here's some approaches on how to do it I

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.800
talked to them that's worked on my team everybody's fully on board that's good so one

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.280
of the things that came up in the offsite we had a people discussion it's not like a

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.080
Microsoft stack ranking we just talk about what people are doing how they're doing the

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.600
twist on this is on the potential category we talked about people's potential we talked

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.920
we framed it a little bit around how well around leadership skills and how well they

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.080
could drive a quality culture or modern testing principles across the org so

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.920
that's the main part on how I push or guide the team towards modern testing

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.920
principles both on my team and outside of my team but I had it I was a little

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.640
afraid to say it out loud but I did and I wasn't too afraid I want to see what

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.480
would happen I was ready for a discussion but I when talking about one

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.520
of my employees I said pretty much something like this blah blah blah they're

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.840
working on this and this is probably the first person on my team first person on

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.560
my team who probably won't do any testing as part of their day-to-day job

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:41.160
and everybody got it I said okay cool yeah I didn't have to explain that

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:47.480
nobody went what's the it was like okay cool that's great no the I see I see

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.320
why you think they're great that's awesome yeah no the fact that you are

00:19:53.320 --> 00:20:00.480
basically saying this guy is probably going to be the first across this line

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:09.760
and when that happens that is a win for the business right in the fact that that

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.290
seems to be universally understood unless your leadership team does what I do and

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.010
that is ignores you when you're talking no no no we are good at calling we are

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.050
good at calling each other out I think if I would have said that six months ago

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:29.130
in our meeting there would have been more discussion but in this case it's

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.330
head nods oh that'd be cool yeah awesome it's like you doing the right thing

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:40.680
there yeah that's that's great to see in terms of this stuff I mean that that

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.000
might be relevant what do you think what do you think because what in

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.860
principle seven we're basically saying you know what it doesn't matter if

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:59.580
testers is dead or not you doing this shifting the testing activity to the

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:07.650
whole team especially the development team and removing the the bottleneck

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:13.520
around the testing specialist that benefits the business sure and what you're

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:20.840
saying is hey you got tacit agreement in your business that either they observe

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.330
that or they seek or they observed the promise of it which do you think it is

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.210
and how do you think you got there I got there because we took off we loosened

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.800
the tourniquet versus ripping off the band-aid we talked about this before

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.720
where many teams have failed moving to a no tester team is by ripping off the

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.440
band-aid and blood spurts everywhere and people that yep metaphorically this

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.360
has been a very gradual change and I believe that's the reason it's working

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.640
and I believe that's the way it will work for 99 or more percent of the teams

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.000
out there the gradual change in your in your pace of gradual can be more or

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.480
less than mine but it's worked because both on a individual level people

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.080
reporting to me on the teams they work on and then on my overall management

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.440
team and the weird part is I'm in a separate basically division from the

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.650
rest of my peers so we don't overlap that much at all okay so it's

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.690
services are for the most part just completely separate from there's part of

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:26.730
my org that overlaps but largely separate so they have begun to see what's

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.850
going on over here on on my team over over on my team and begin to adopt some

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:36.440
of those things but I think as far as my peers accepting that was just seeing

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.960
me we've been talking about quality culture across the org together I think

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.120
they see it from that they get where we want to go what building a quality

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.730
culture roadmap has helped me to do we can maybe dive into this in a future

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:55.730
episode is it's it's a framework or a model that's worked to get everybody on

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:02.290
the same page with what we want quality to do across unity and it's again I

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.090
haven't it's a model all models are wrong some are useful but it's helped

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.290
to drive even teams outside of mine towards something that looks like modern

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.860
testing like you saw a rough you saw an early draft of this yeah this is what

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.060
we're working from no and it reflects many or most of the modern testing

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.380
principles and moving from the left to the right in the for better for it's

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.780
not the right word for the maturity model I built no I know and I think we'll

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:35.300
probably end up talking about it on the podcast because I think it's a good

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:41.220
follow-up like this you know episode seven or the series that we're doing

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:46.100
right now is around what the hell do we mean when we say this right right I think

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:52.660
in the next series of follow-ups will probably be more practical around hey

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:58.340
this is the phase this is what it means like again it's this whole concept is a

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:05.060
living yeah yeah breathing thing on it although I will say in advance I think

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:10.380
we better do a mailbag episode 89 to catch up on a lot of questions I agree

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.390
then we'll figure out what to do after that but what do you think was there

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:24.640
anything so I get your approach I get the strategy but for the listeners like

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.570
what is when you if you were to do this all over again knowing what you've

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:35.550
learned now because you were kind of also making it up as you went along if

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.510
you were to go back and say okay if I were to start this all over again what

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:46.210
would have concretely been your first goal given that you were trying to ease

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:52.120
into it I'll have to think for a minute while I talk but my gut reaction is not

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.280
much it wasn't as much as that I figured out what I was doing when I went

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.600
along of course I always adapt and adjust as I go along what I've done as

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:08.070
I've moved along is tried to document how I'm doing what I'm doing maybe I

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.070
would have dove into building that model earlier a lot of it the reason that I was

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:17.470
able to spit that out the reason it's been pretty adoptable without a lot of

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:24.160
editing by a large part of the team is because it was all in my head first

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.720
well so yet so one of the things that I know it explained what was in my head

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.600
so I had to sometimes it to dump out what you do intrinsically for people to

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:41.040
understand it and you understand definitely had a vision yes right and

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:48.470
over the last year plus I think we've put a put a name to that vision in

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.150
combination with what you're doing now as well as my own experiences on this

00:25:53.150 --> 00:26:00.350
front right your experience is you slowly loosen the tourniquet right yeah my

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:09.850
experience I guess it was it was a band-aid rip right right but in I was able

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:17.170
to succeed through it because I had testing experience and several of my IC's

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:23.890
had testing experience so like one of the things I think helped me deal with

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:30.010
the the band-aid rip is with the fact that I was in charge and I had this

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:34.370
balance experience yes and that would help too so one thing to keep in mind is

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:38.650
and again I go back to the phrase from heffetz disappoint people at a level

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.610
they can absorb which is also loosening the tourniquet at a level you can

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:47.930
handle there are parts of my org in fact a big chunk of my org where things were

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.730
going fine we had the right leadership in place both from executive leadership

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.370
as well from people on the team that knew what they were doing that we did

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.640
eliminate the test role so parts of my team we've done that and was the right

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.850
time it's worked out very well I'm not and I know which parts of my team that

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:10.010
will happen in next and I know which parts will take a while longer but it's

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:14.290
so my role is a lot about keeping an eye on how much bleeding is coming out

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:18.920
on the tourniquet continually loosening it to keep the metaphor going and

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.040
finding out when the right time is to take it off completely so I'm parts

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.360
of my team it's just a very gradual experience to make sure we get it

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.680
right and parts of my team were there and I've done it and eventually as I

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:35.920
mentioned before on the podcast if I do my job right and we get this far I no

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.660
longer have direct reports and I do something different I unity I have a

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.280
hypothesis here okay and it's it's entirely anecdotal and based on what

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.840
I've observed over the last couple of years here at Microsoft and I think it

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.840
potentially aligns with what you're saying I do think this push towards a

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:02.440
combined engineering model is unstoppable the unified engineering sorry thank you

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:10.440
unified engineering model is unstoppable it will eventually be more common than

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.400
not but that means a lot of companies teams are gonna go through transition

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:24.840
and my hypothesis presently is when you do that and you have a separated

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.160
discipline you're gonna have a different ordering or you're gonna have a set of ICs

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.920
on both sides and a set of managers on both sides and the task is how do you

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:42.280
intermix this my hypothesis and I will say it is absolutely untested or

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:51.680
unproven but my hypothesis is if you form this up and you have a former dev

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:58.770
manager as the manager of the team now you have to take the the the boil the

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:04.120
frog approach but if it's the other way around and you put the test manager in

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:11.680
charge as long as he's worth his salt and management no I think I think you

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:21.540
can rip the bandy I that's my hypothesis I think that could work um the they may

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.180
not even be the the test manager I think a leader you need it need a leader with

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:32.250
the experience on the team so probably the manager but one of the things I'm

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:37.730
doing on all my teams is making sure we have those leaders in place to help

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.410
work directly with everyone on the team to make sure they know what to do

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.690
because right now we have dev managers in place I think is fine

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:48.600
dev managers in charge which is fine but they need you know this is what I did

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.800
this is basically what I did on my last couple teams at Microsoft I was the the

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.880
quality guy yep air quote and my job was to make sure that everyone did the

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.480
right types of testing and eventually we did some of that for them through some

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:08.380
vendors but long story so yeah I think your hypothesis is correct you need it

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.540
doesn't work if you don't have people on your team who deeply understand testing

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:19.000
to help with the transition no yeah for a while for a while you need a deep

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.920
specialist to help the team become generalizing specialists and I'm now

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.600
thinking through why do I think that when you when you if you do the reorg

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.440
model where the former dev manager is the one that's still in charge why do

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.520
you need to to ease the frog or boil the frog it's essentially because you're now

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:48.360
actually also you not only need to also teach the dev the new development nice

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:55.000
he's or the new unified engineers you know how this quality culture works but

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:03.290
you need to teach that guy or gal what is the measures that now defines success

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.570
because in some regards it's gonna it's gonna fly in the face of their

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:14.410
experience right a lot of the times is you know how how accurate are your

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:21.550
estimates right right but now you're actually making that guy a little bit

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:27.250
more holistic and when I found actually is is test managers moving into that

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:34.890
role already get the dev side of it yeah right I believe that's true and that's

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:41.480
that's that's the modern tester role right so let me talk about DevOps for a

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.240
minute and this again I will I will dive jump it on the outside and send her

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.660
back on the world some company did a survey recently that irked me a little

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:56.500
bit because they and I have I have semantic buttons that you can push on me

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.940
all over the place not as bad as some but bad enough so they're talking about

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:06.180
DevOps and they were surprised in their survey that only 50% of the teams they

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:13.850
surveyed had dedicated DevOps teams and I thought what the fudge sickle because to

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:20.250
me too high or too low well to me as I learned DevOps and I studied DevOps

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:29.030
DevOps is a culture it is but you could have a DevOps team that would help the

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.510
team drive towards that culture so what I tweeted a while back which I think is

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:37.990
relevant here they said after reading that I said I'm in the DevOps is a

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.390
culture not a roll camp yet I'm only slightly annoyed that there are DevOps

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:46.710
roles or teams as those people in teams are there to create a culture of DevOps

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:51.150
on the team eventually the team will have a DevOps culture and not need a

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:57.800
DevOps team yeah so I don't correct I don't need elaboration so then I tweeted

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.000
again and I replaced one word see if you can tell the difference I'm in the

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.040
quality is a culture not a roll camp yet I'm only slightly annoyed that there

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.600
are quality roles or teams if those people or teams are there to create a

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.960
culture of quality on the team eventually the team will have a quality

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:20.730
culture and not need a quality team WTF is the difference you just replaced

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:29.340
quality and DevOps but it still makes sense yeah I guess the only problem I

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.140
had with what you said is if you had said everything and said the word test

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.940
but you're right I don't think you need a quality role either so going back to

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:46.800
that survey to me it's I think they were if you take it from a more

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.440
respectful point of view and you go okay this company whoever did this they had

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:57.480
some expectation that the majority of companies that had DevOps were in let's

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:03.560
say the first maturity phase of going to a DevOps system right in that first

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.600
maturity phase it's brand-new knowledge yeah you need to bring in

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.600
specialists you need to bring in experts no I and I can teach the others

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.120
yes and a lot of the times that experts gonna be doing the lot 80% of the work

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.500
because it's all a bootstrapping effort yeah it's bootstrapping and leadership

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.820
absolutely it's bootstrapping and leadership which leads to a question I've

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.260
heard about this which is a good question I think with an obvious answer

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.100
based on what you just said at least in my opinion I've had people ask me

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.860
hey angry weasel they say because that's what they call me a lot of people do

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:43.060
yeah a lot of people do so let's say I have a team that gets to a stage where

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.220
they don't need a dedicated testing specialist and we go on for a while and

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:53.840
there's turnover and the team changes and that knowledge of testing is lost now

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:59.640
what do they do well one you retrospect on why that knowledge of quality and

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.760
why that knowledge of testing was lost on the team and figure out what what to

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.960
fix doesn't just shouldn't just go away but two maybe maybe you do go back and

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:12.650
bring in a consultant to your higher you don't go higher a test team because you

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.330
forgot how to test but you can bring in a air quote modern tester role to help

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.530
you get back on track right it's same as you'd hire a like oh man our DevOps

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:27.640
went to shit sorry sorry I to answer it's got already really you do it

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.840
again yes right but but I think you're absolutely right because in that scenario

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.200
it's hypothetical right because I'm like how would this suddenly how would this

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.600
knowledge suddenly just yeah I don't I don't think it was a hypothetical

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:50.480
question right if you do it right in a way you go from a modern tester helping

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.880
the team transition if the whole team understands modern testing principles and

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.160
we don't do this stuff just for that the modern testing principles aren't

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.280
important just for the sake of following principles they help you make better

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:11.220
software yeah there is like if you are kicking butt on the principles nobody's

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.580
gonna want to go backwards god I want to do so much testing it was more fun when

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.930
customers were bitching all the time it's been a while right where I brought

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:25.330
up the the monkey's experiment which there's debate as to whether or not

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:32.370
it's actual experiment or just a modern a sub s fable but this is the one where

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.970
with the monkey's and the latter electric shock and the and yeah yeah yeah right

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:49.040
and where essentially there is social pressure to conform so once you have

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.160
built up the quality culture and it's and it's achieved this it's tipping

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.520
point and it's now part of the subconscious most muscle memory of how

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:05.640
your team does business how does that go away well the only way it goes away is

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.280
if you get rid of all the people who have learned this muscle memory and

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.760
start new or isolation if you have the same people and suddenly isolation comes

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.520
into play hopefully that's because of some business imperative that's temporary

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:28.920
but if it's not then you're out and get rid of it again and one thing to be I

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.930
want to be clear on is modern testing principles or modern testing as we talk

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:41.050
about it isn't a huge leap forward we've been doing agile for a long time pretty

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:46.130
good at it few holes then Crispin and Gregory the agile testing books fantastic

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.210
talk about them all the time it like okay that's how testing works there they

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:55.490
talk about the whole team quality approach we're just essentially taking our

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.330
experiences and what's worked and extending on that even farther and

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:05.090
doubling down on the whole team approach yep and raising the value of the

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:10.410
importance of data so there was a Twitter feed or a slack channel

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:16.730
conversation I forget which at this point in time where people were like yeah

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:23.330
this is all all you know pipe dream philosophy so and then the thing is I

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:28.650
completely ignore those things because even though from their point of view it's

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:34.650
theoretical for me it is long since stopped yes yes no for the thing to

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.070
again we're in a little bit of an echo chamber here if you yeah if you're

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:43.090
listening to this episode you're nodding your head going yes yes but what has

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.250
been interesting to me and I mentioned Caner's book earlier because we walked

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:51.130
into our recording our recording studio and someone had left a copy of Kim

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:55.970
Caner's testing software in the room so it just kind of funny to see where we

00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:00.270
come from traditional versus modern testing yes but for everyone that's like

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:04.730
you know pipe dreams and dumb and you know this is wrecking testing or

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.690
ruining the craft the number of people nodding their heads and saying things

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:12.290
like we're already doing that or I had there was one person I mentioned before

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:18.690
on the episode where I'm sorry on the episode on the podcast where they showed

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:24.450
my talk at test bash and to their dev team and the devs said things like it

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:29.670
seems like common sense to me yeah it should it should be common sense we're

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:33.550
trying to just like I did with the culture stuff that you've seen on my

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:40.480
team we've tried to take things that we have been talking about in essence

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.360
boil them down to principles they've tried it to document what it is we're

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.440
saying so you have to listen to you hours and hours of podcasts to kind of

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:54.670
get what is it we believe about where about where quality comes from that is a

00:39:54.670 --> 00:40:01.310
whole additional philosophy I think it's something we should just go deeper

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:08.350
and on that the first thing is in my view if you look look back and think

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:14.270
about the summation of the modern testing principles what we see is hey

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:23.250
there is a lot of value in this community in terms of its ability to help drive up

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:31.020
customer quality and that there is a lot of value in driving up that that

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:42.550
customer value to the business we also see number one testing is is on its way

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:48.230
out I'll just say no way don't split that way testing is not on its way out

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:55.350
no testers testing specialists that that's it is on its way out testing is

00:40:55.350 --> 00:41:01.180
still necessary thank you for that correction but the business more

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:07.740
benefits at this transitional stage by us sitting with the developers and

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:16.700
helping them to own it yeah and then us doing something that's even more

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:22.900
valuable pursuing value versus reducing costs and going all right now how do we

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:29.820
take our strengths and our skills around customer advocacy make them real and

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.500
focus on what actually makes these customers happy what actually pisses

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:41.820
them off and carve a new role for these folks yeah yeah and to be clear as I

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.980
mentioned this person on my team who I said would be the first person to

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:52.170
probably not do testing as part of their job I'm not firing them they have

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:58.050
they are still a testing specialist they are there if a testing expertise is

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:01.850
needed but they're focused on some of these other things that bring value to

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:06.010
the customer and doing some feature work as well there is another thing that I've

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:11.290
observed so now I'm gonna have asked you to go back to the days where you

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:16.600
still worked at Microsoft you and I survived and there hasn't been another

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.760
big hit to test but that's mostly because at Microsoft test is there's still

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:27.470
some pockets but it's mostly gone but in our careers here we went through major

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:37.100
several major transitions to the test discipline right sure one you know get

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:42.700
rid of the manual testers to there's a several others I'm forgetting but the

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:48.740
one pattern in you and I actually talked about this long ago in in the test

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.920
architecture group that used to maintain one of the things we observed is that

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:58.530
after a year or so after that transition all the doom and gloom that was

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:04.050
predicted didn't happen no it didn't not only that but it caused a lot of

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:09.330
sensationalistic tweets from the outside looking in it did but not only that the

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:17.040
people who went through that transition personally ended up better fitting more

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:23.720
sure right we saw that they were considered more credible we saw

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:29.920
promotion rates as a community as a whole actually moved right shift that is

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.680
correct and in this case it's no different what we're saying but I'm

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.640
actually saying is it doesn't make sense to own this anymore that seems to

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.000
be the trends if you are a modern tester and you are leading this

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.480
particularly if you're in a manager role start working with your guys and

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:56.740
easing them into the transition and give them a new place for their career to go

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:04.100
and that new place is a more positive one yes and I think like I'm repeating

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.460
myself here but if you're worried about your you like I like the principal but

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:16.020
all my job to go away I like testing still I would expect none of my team does

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:22.220
more than they all do far less than half the testing on the team from that point

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.980
it's a sensible transition where they do less and less the only parting wisdom I

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:35.660
would say on this particular topic is within Microsoft and I know because it's

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:43.720
it's now documented I saw the signs of this occurring around three years before

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.510
it actually occurred right because I saw the where the momentum was going I saw

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:53.350
what would be the obvious conclusion and I also saw what the bottleneck was

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:59.330
the bottleneck was executives were unsure and they needed someone to show

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:05.370
the way and I knew that once that occurred it would be rapid and I had

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:09.690
people come back and accuse me of being prescient and I'm like no I

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:17.390
wasn't foretelling the future I just analyzed this hindsight 2020 though

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:23.830
during that phase I spent a lot of time arguing with people who who held on to

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:31.360
white knuckles with their current thing and I realized now that I was pretty

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:37.360
much a waste of my time so some people are going to merge into it some people

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:43.260
are going to be open and spend your time influencing those but I would recommend

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.520
a three strikes your out rule on the folks that are just defending the set

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:55.960
as quo you can't save everyone and the ones who don't want to be saved your

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:02.960
time is better spent on investing in the ones that yep do one hopefully that's

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.200
good one parting comment is we want to do questions next time about modern

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.160
testing principles around data around anything you want you want to know about

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.840
color my hair is I'll tell you it's the same color it's always been great a few

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.160
more gray hairs in there you can either join our slack channel and go to anger

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.600
weasel.com wack AB testing and find that or you can just email me at Alan at

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.400
angry weasel calm and I will make sure your questions hopefully get answered on

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:31.510
the air yeah all right I'll bet I got the code next time mail for sure we

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:34.750
give that a shot all right I am Alan I'm Brett thanks for listening we'll see you

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.110
next time
