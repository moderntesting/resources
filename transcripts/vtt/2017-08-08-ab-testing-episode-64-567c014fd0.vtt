WEBVTT

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.310
Hey, Alan.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.430
How's it going, man?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.670
Going good.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.190
We are back for a brand new episode of A.B. testing.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.390
Episode number 64.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.150
Square number.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.790
I once again can't believe I made it this far, but I'm happy.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.190
And we will find something new and interesting or regurgitated

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.430
to talk about, which is pretty much the way

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.950
things work at A.B. testing.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.180
Yes.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.780
Good to be here.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.460
Good to see you hanging out in our hazy Seattle weather.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.200
Canada sent all their fire smoke to us.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Yeah, it actually caused some disturbance in the Jensen

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.520
household, because my kids were like, dad, why

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.760
does it look so foggy?

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.040
And I'm like, that doesn't look like fog.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.840
That looks like smog.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.240
And they're like, what?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.200
Smog?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.920
Yeah, they looked at me like, what?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.600
Why?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.640
Oh, dad making up words again.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.960
I'm like, no, this one's actually a thing.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.400
You just don't see it much in this part of the country.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.880
No.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.240
In our green, green Seattle.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.750
Where I grew up, you see it all of the time.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.290
All right, I'm heading off to Helsinki next week again.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.410
Didn't you just come back from someplace?

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.530
Actually, I haven't traveled in a while.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.610
I go to San Francisco a lot.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.890
I don't even count that as travel anymore.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.780
I just call that a longer commute to work.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.220
And often, most times I go down, I will go down for the day.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.100
I'll take the 630 flight.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.020
I'll get into the office by 9.15 or so,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.100
and I'll spend the whole day there and take a 7 o'clock

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.940
flight home.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.740
It must have been a trip to San Francisco.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:48.860
I vaguely recall you diatribing on interaction

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.140
with some of our fellow humans on your last flight.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.340
Oh, probably.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.060
I always complain about my humans.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.580
Actually, for the commuter flights,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.980
they're actually doing pretty good.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.620
I went to Helsinki once already in March,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.060
but heading back, having a leads off site there

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.900
to talk about people, do some planning, et cetera,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.900
should be a good time.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.100
And there may be some drinking.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.740
I've heard that happened in Helsinki.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.500
I've heard it happens in Helsinki.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500
But I didn't look it up.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.660
I think the day should be about 20 hours long, 22,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.500
somewhere in there.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.900
Yeah, it helps you go to sleep.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.760
All right.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.960
Hey, before we get started today,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880
we have a sponsor for this episode.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.520
Once again, the lovely folks at Star or TechWell,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.320
I should say, who do the Star conferences

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.240
also have a conference called Agile Dev East.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.800
What?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680
Yeah, what?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.840
What?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.360
And if you are looking for customized learning options

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.280
to explore test-driven development techniques,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.600
tool selection, automation design,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.560
to fully integrate testing into Agile's delivery teams,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.440
you can attend Agile Dev East, which is the premier Agile

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.160
event covering the latest techniques and topics

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.720
to understand the efficiency necessary for project success.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.200
And that is this November 5th through 10th

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.960
in Orlando, Florida, home of Disney World.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.600
So is Star renamed, rebranded?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.880
No, Star is in May.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.400
This is actually Agile Dev East.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.160
TechWell does a whole bunch of different conferences.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.480
This one largely geared towards Agile Dev.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.080
But there's like, I think it's coming up here in my script,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.910
but a whole bunch of topics on Agile testing.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.910
Love it.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.190
Me too.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.150
Learn the technical and team skills

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.430
testers need for success in the world of Agile development.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.350
Immerse yourself in hot topics such as Agile and Lean

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.350
development principles and practices,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.550
scaled Agile development, Agile teams and leadership,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.630
digital transformation, and more.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.270
And once again, stopping for annotation.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.150
As I was thinking while I was reading that is,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.830
this would be a great conference to,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.310
if you're an Agile tester or a modern tester,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.990
attend it with some of your dev counterparts.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.470
Yeah.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.630
The whole team can go.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.470
I actually really like that idea.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.950
Yeah.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.990
As an added bonus.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.010
Bonus?

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.810
Who doesn't like an added bonus?

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.930
Agile Dev East is co-located with better software and DevOps

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.610
East conferences.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.850
Your one registration automatically

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.970
gives you access to all three programs.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.850
Holy cow.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.090
Bring the whole company.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.490
What are those conferences?

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.570
Better software.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.090
OK.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.610
And DevOps East.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.730
And there's so much overlap.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.530
We've talked about, there is a massive,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.930
especially where I work, a gray, gray, almost white,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.730
invisible line between ops and dev and test.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.290
So I could, this would be one of those conferences

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.130
where I would maximize my value by watching

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.280
like 10 minutes of every talk, skipping from room to room.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.080
Hopefully they have them recorded.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.680
Yeah.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.280
Wow.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.720
Back on track here, your one registration, as I mentioned,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.280
automatically gives you access to all three programs

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.960
with insights and solutions across the dev lifecycle

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.080
to build a customized week of learning that fits you

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.960
and your organization's specific needs.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.520
Explore the program at well.tc, W-E-L-L.TC,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.960
forward slash A-B testing.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.560
And I'll put this in the notes on the website.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.210
And of course, I wouldn't have gotten this far

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.530
if I wasn't going to mention this.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.810
A-B testing listeners can use the code A-B test

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.570
to receive up to $200 off their conference registration fee,

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.850
register by September 8th, super early bird deadline,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.130
which isn't that early for a conference in November.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.970
That's great.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.290
For combined savings for up to $600 off.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.840
And when you start talking about bringing your whole team,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.360
that's a heck of a savings overall.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.280
You can tell your boss that's in the whole team

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.800
and take the money saved.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.000
And Alan said you could have that money as a bonus.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.720
You did say an added bonus.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.400
Yeah, I did say an added bonus.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.240
TechWell does not guarantee your boss will give you that bonus,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.560
but that is a suggestion from me.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.280
Let me know how that works.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.000
Again, well.tc, WAC-AB testing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.880
I'll post that later.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.760
But that sounds like, I mean, that's a good idea.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.920
That's like putting, that's like a food court.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.080
I'm going to use this.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.400
And thank you, TechWell, for the sponsorship.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.520
And I hope our listeners go.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.280
But I want to use this topic to this ad, this sponsorship,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.160
to in thinking about this show, it's

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.120
inspired a lot of questions that I thought

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.920
I could think about myself, or I could just bounce them off

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.200
of you here today once you stop looking at your phone.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.320
I'm just looking at the topics here.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.960
Lots of topics.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.160
They got lean, they got safe.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.960
Scrum, something called Icy Agile.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.440
I've never heard of that one.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.960
You ever had lunch at Google?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.680
Yes.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.460
So you have a whole bunch of different kinds of food

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.700
you can eat.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.960
And you can eat as much as you want.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.350
This is that for agile.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.410
OK.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.050
Yeah, the second part of your phrase

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.290
is a little scary when it comes to agile.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.970
Yeah, just fill up a little bit of a,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.530
go to the sushi bar, get some of that, and go,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:19.970
you know what?

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.250
I'm kind of hungry today.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.930
I'm also going to go to the pasta bar.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.290
And this guy's making fresh smoked teriyaki something.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.490
I'm going to have some of that.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.450
And because I'm desserts.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.010
And yeah.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.900
So agile is a little dangerous when you pick and choose a la carte.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.390
OK, don't take my metaphor for what it's worth,

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.630
and then shut up.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.230
Shutting up.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.510
Shutting up, yeah.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.550
So I want to talk about agile and agile testing.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.710
One thing I'm all out of order here

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.870
because I'm thinking while I talk and this shit happens

00:07:52.870 --> 00:08:00.000
is our podcast, A-B Testing, is as much of an agile podcast

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.020
as it is a testing podcast, as it is a quality podcast,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.540
as it is a podcast about nothing particularly at all.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.260
And then every now and again, data.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.420
And data as well, absolutely.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.060
So we're, which I like.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.340
And I am going to break my arm a little bit

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.540
and pat ourselves on the back because I

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.380
do listen to every podcast, not in its finalized form,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.140
but during editing.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.060
I get to re-listen back.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.660
And I also listen to a lot of podcasts in my car.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.860
My car has TuneIn radio built in, which has podcasts built in.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.970
So I can just have my favorites there and listen to them.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.610
TuneIn has a podcast here?

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.330
Yeah.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.450
And I listen to a lot of different podcasts

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.650
about a bunch of different ideas.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.850
And as far as production quality and speaker quality

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.130
and pretty much intelligence quality and everything else,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:09:01.890
we don't compare at all to things like most 99% invisible.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.850
I mean, there's some really well-done podcasts out there.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.370
But I got to tell you, when I listen to agile podcasts

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.810
and testing podcasts, and this is just my ego talking,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.770
but I think we have a pretty damn good podcast,

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.050
despite the fact that we're idiots.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.650
It's amazing.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.690
I think it's listenable.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.850
I think we have topics that inspire thought.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.210
And I'm proud of all we've done.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.490
I am as well.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:32.240
Yeah, I've listened to several agile podcasts.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.160
And one of the things I personally think,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.320
I think we're a lot more entertaining.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.720
I like to think so.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.560
So tell your friends that we're cool.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.640
I am now up to this is the awkward thing.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.640
I have an awkward point in my life.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.440
This never happened to me at Microsoft.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.680
Now it's happened at Unity, is I now

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.520
have at least three people who tell me they actively

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.440
listen to the podcast.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440
That are employees?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.920
Employees of mine.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.880
I have employees that, in our one-on-one topics,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.880
list an episode of A-B testing where

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.960
they want to talk about something I talked about

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.880
on that episode more.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.860
So I have to be clear.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.100
Did you tell them the mailbag link is right here?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.820
Yeah.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.980
Talk to the hand.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.780
And the hand has an A-B testing tattoo on it.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.060
No, I want them to post it on the mailbag link

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.580
just so that I can help them torture you.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.620
Oh, great.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.180
And usually it's like, so far it's been, I like that idea.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.640
How do you think that applies here?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.160
Oh, that's good.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.000
So yeah.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.500
That's good.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.400
Anyway, it's scary and bizarre.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.280
And then someone internally asked about,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.880
are there articles or podcasts I should

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.520
listen to and one of them post, check out the A-B testing

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.000
podcast.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.840
No, I don't need more listeners.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.340
No.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.380
But I don't think I've ever said or I'm not

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.620
one to guard my words.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.820
So I think if I ever said anything, totally controversial.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.260
I work with a VP who's a something.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.500
One, it's just not true.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.740
But two, I think they go, oh, yeah, totally.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.460
Like if the thing is, I'll phrase it.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.140
I think you have done that one, though.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.380
Actually, I have had.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.180
There is one VP in particular I'm thinking of.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.500
At Microsoft or here?

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.380
Microsoft.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:29.880
Oh, yeah.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.380
Yeah.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.780
And that's what I was going to say.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.740
It's like, I will call it like it is.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.560
And most the time, it's like, yeah, that's true.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.120
Definitely, I work with some dipshit VPs at Microsoft.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.200
I think that stays in the PG-13 area.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.240
So I'm going to leave that in.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.740
So yeah.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.160
So we're talking about the podcast.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.760
It's good.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.440
People like it.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.480
They listen to it.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.630
And then Agile.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.430
I'm going to ask you.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.910
Before you do that, just to close out the star thing.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.830
Oh, sure.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.150
I love this Agile Dev conference idea.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.350
I really do.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.270
I love the idea of people bringing their whole teams.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.310
Especially with the three conferences co-located.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.470
That's like a conference extravaganza.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.550
The topics are interesting and diverse.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.260
One of the things I think might be interesting as well

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.460
is that they had tracks, depending

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.300
on the maturity level of your team.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.780
I think they will have tracks.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.620
And one thing I've done, and Lee Copeland

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.540
suggested this at the conferences.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.940
And I suggested, I hinted at it earlier when

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.940
I said I'd go to a bunch of talks for 10 minutes,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.940
is you really do need to vote with your feet.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.260
Because you're going to have, I

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.180
can imagine, as much as 10 or more different talks going

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.500
on at once, maybe more across the conferences.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.020
If you can't decide between two or three or four,

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.700
it's OK to rotate through and find the one that

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.940
fits what you're looking for.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.900
I think you have to use the power of your feet

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.540
and realize you're not going to offend a speaker

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.340
if you step out in the middle to get your most

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.940
value out of the conference.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.900
Completely agree in terms of learning.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.680
But I won't say this for too many topics, but for Agile,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.560
I will.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.360
It's one of those things where you

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.080
do want to at least understand the minimum number of rules

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.560
before you begin and follow those rules directly.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.800
Yeah, and I agree because I have seen probably

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.960
one of the biggest mistakes I see in Agile

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.320
is just doing part of it for Agile.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320
Yeah.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.600
Doing part of it or doing a part of it to the extreme,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.830
just see every rant I've done on A-B testing

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.430
on the Agile manifesto.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.070
But I love this idea.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.570
I love the team inclusiveness.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.650
It's fantastic.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.090
I had never heard of this before.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.280
This is a great idea.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.680
I'm glad you approve.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.280
I have so many things to talk about.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.920
I'm not going to skip that one, but I'm going to go on.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.870
I want to talk about Agile testing.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.550
What is Agile testing?

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.110
Testing.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.590
Agile testing, to the best of my knowledge,

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.830
is when you have a separated test team that

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:38.130
is operating in an Agile software delivery cycle.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.610
You mean like a separate organization?

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.680
Yeah.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.320
That's where I've seen that term used the most often.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.630
So I reread Agile testing, the Chris and Gregory book,

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.230
the first one.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.230
OK.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.550
To be honest, I reread the first three

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.030
quarters of the book that I stopped

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.510
because I had some other work to do.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.910
And I had read it, it's probably my third time reading it.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.110
I didn't realize how much I'd forgotten

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.950
and how much has either subconsciously or just

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.430
by way of work become very relevant to what I do,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.590
what we do, what we've talked about on the show.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.710
I saw you on Twitter.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:18.870
And I'm going to get to that.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.310
So one example is on your definition

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.190
is in the Agile testing book, Crispin and Gregory

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.430
definitely advocate the role of the embedded tester

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.010
on the team.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.930
The tester is in the end.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.810
So a test specialist.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.850
Yes, exactly.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.450
Exactly.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.650
And I also noticed they talked about the idea

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.370
that a test organization can be separate,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.930
run by a separate person, even though those testers are

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.770
embedded.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:56.080
And then I was surprised, maybe not surprised

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.280
is the wrong word, but like I.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.520
Flabbergasted?

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.880
A little bit flabbergasted.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.960
Maybe not too strong of a word.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.080
But right there on page 60, and I've talked about,

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080
and I thought I came up with this organically.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.360
And I may have, and I don't know,

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.640
the brain works in mysterious ways.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.320
But they talked about, and we've talked about this,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:21.560
shot, the test team being more of a test community run

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.360
by the QA director or QA manager, whatever it's called.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.240
And they used those exact words in the book.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.920
I thought, holy crap.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.420
And obviously, their words came out way before I

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.500
came to this conclusion.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.980
But I think it's, I've been talking about this

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.860
since I joined Unity.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.540
I figured this community thing out a month in.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.860
Like, oh, of course, this is how it works.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.460
And they thought so too.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.260
But then did my brain see that once and then

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.260
make the translation?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.780
But I do really feel like it was something I recognized.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.820
Because my background for even years before that

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.980
has been building communities.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.980
So I feel like I came to that on my own free will.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.620
But very interesting.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.660
I love that idea.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.660
And I love, I always think about it

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.980
I always love when I read a book that supports the ideas I

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.730
already think.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.250
Yeah.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.170
It validates me.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.690
I like to feel validated.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.330
That's the last book I read along those lines

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.010
was the head first design patterns.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.230
Because I always designed in a design pattern way,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.790
but without realizing it.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.830
And then when I read that book, I'm like, oh, this is what I do.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:39.550
And oh my god, there's ways to do what I do better.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.230
And honestly, that is the, as far as learning design patterns,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.270
that is the number one book I recommend.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.750
Yep.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.550
It is.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.230
I mean, I read the Gang of Four book.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.870
Actually.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:50.870
Why?

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.390
Let me tell you, I can't say read.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.270
I looked at all the words in the Gang of Four book.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.300
But it could, it was, it's a cure for insomnia.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.140
And it's such good information.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.460
But it's just I don't read books like that very well.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.340
But I enjoyed, I mean, how many times

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.220
you got a textbook that was sort of a page turner?

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.580
And to me, head first design patterns, really, it was engaging.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.700
It was.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.760
I read the whole, I read, number one,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.040
it's very rare that a textbook, I read it cover to cover.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.760
I read this one cover to cover, and I did it in two weeks.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.080
Including stopping, taking a design.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.120
There was a tool I was working at the same time.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.400
And I would, every time I learned a new pattern,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.920
I artificially included that in the tool.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.120
In some places, it made a horrible design.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.840
But in other places, it was fantastic.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.080
Cannot recommend that book enough.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.120
On design patterns, and then we should go back

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.920
to the other topic, but on design patterns,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.040
there are only three books you should buy.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.120
Head first design patterns.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.600
A book by Al Shalloway and his team at NetObjectives,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.160
which is called Explaining Design Patterns.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.520
Which I haven't read.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.520
And then the Gang of Four book.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.840
No.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.760
And the reason why is, number one,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.520
the head first design patterns book is going to tell you

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.440
why design patterns are frigging useful.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.120
Al Shalloway's book, Explaining Design Patterns,

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.150
is going to show you how to design with them.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.690
You have lots of options with design patterns.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.250
If you need to connect two objects,

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.690
should you use the adapter or the bridge or the facade?

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.450
Al Shalloway's book helps you through that.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.810
And then the Gang of Four's book

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.490
is really a reference manual.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.610
This gives you the, for some reason,

00:19:55.610 --> 00:20:00.090
you need a design pattern beyond the common 20.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.180
The Gang of Four book has them.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.500
That's it.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.540
You should read the Gang of Four book

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.660
with as much vigor as you would a dictionary.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.910
All right, Agile Testing, Modern Testing.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.670
I should point out here,

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.870
and I'll put this on the website.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.500
I think I may have mentioned this to you, maybe not.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.220
The Chris and Gregory book, Agile Testing,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.020
their follow-up, More Agile Testing,

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.460
which is a whole new book.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.700
It's a whole new book.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.380
And Gang of All the books, especially the Gang of Four book,

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.500
which is called, and the Gang of Four book,

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.300
for those not familiar with design patterns,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.080
there's four authors, and it's just called Design Patterns.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.920
Yep.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.160
You can internet search Gang of Four, it'll show up.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.400
There's the O'Reilly headfirst, O'Reilly's publisher,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.040
Headfirst Design Patterns,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.640
which uses Java as examples,

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.400
but it's totally readable, totally fun.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.840
And the Al Shalloway book called?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.480
Explaining Design Patterns.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.310
Now, I wouldn't recommend this for the Headfirst book

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.950
because it's full of great pictures and things.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.750
But if you ever like listening to books on audio,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.430
our listeners can always go to audibletrial.com,

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.950
WACAB testing, and get their first free month

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.300
of Audible for Free, the first month of Audible for Free.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.140
Yeah.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.980
I haven't promo'd that before,

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.820
but I'll just throw that in there

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.980
because we're kind of in book mode.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.820
So.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.500
And then I guess the last Design Pattern book,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.740
because you talked about the Gang of Four book.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.100
Do you know where the Gang of Four book

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.540
got their idea from?

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.020
Yeah, from, oh shoot, what's his name?

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.020
The Architect.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.900
It'll come to me, give me a hint.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.230
His full name is actually the name,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.350
the combined name of My Two Boys.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.800
Not a great hint for you, I know.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.200
That is not a good hint, give me initials.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200
C-A.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.110
It's Alexander.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.270
Last name is Alexander.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.110
Yep.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.110
It's Charles.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.110
Yep.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.340
I do remember it's Alexander.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.620
I'm awful at guessing games.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.380
Let me give you one more second though.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.570
Dunno.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.410
Christopher Alexander.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.410
Christopher, that's right.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.250
Damn it.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.370
Timeless way of building.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.210
Did you name your kids after the Design Patterns?

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.930
No, it was accidental.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.690
I didn't even know about Christopher Alexander

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.530
until after my kids were born.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:34.610
Maybe not consciously.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.740
Yeah.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.660
But back to this idea of,

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.160
like Stephen Johnson,

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:52.060
he talks about how ideas can only happen

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.700
when there's enough of a background for it to be possible.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.060
And then when it's possible,

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.060
it's very common for them the same idea to pop up

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.620
in multiple different places.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.540
Because it's just,

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.020
in a lot of regards,

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.780
it's just a logical conclusion

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.420
to the two ideas coming together.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.260
You.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.660
This is Stephen Johnson.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.100
Where good ideas come from?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.540
You have constantly been involved in testing

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.460
as well as you have constantly been involved

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.500
in community building.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.500
So I find it not surprising at all

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.420
that you may have independently come up

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.380
with the same idea.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.300
Yep, totally fine.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.140
Totally fine.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.190
It's been a long time since I've read

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.790
the Crispin Gregory book.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.750
So when I hear about this talk about community,

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.150
I constantly think of it in terms of

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.590
a matrix-style organization.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.430
Yes.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.030
And that's what they're referring to.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.310
Yeah, and I use that explanation a lot.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.270
Kind of how we work.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.110
So in rereading that book,

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.390
it's like a lot of head nods.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.110
Yeah, embedded, obviously they don't use the phrase,

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.470
accelerating the achievement, the shippable quality.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.350
But there's a lot of test specialists

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.190
sort of working with that.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.310
If they want to, we can make the licensing.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.700
Yeah.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.980
Not having, and again, that is a book,

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.740
probably the book on Agile testing,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.140
but there's a lot of variations out there

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.940
on what testing is on an Agile team.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.940
So the question I have for you is on this show,

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.900
we've talked a bit about what you and I

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.460
are called modern testing.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.300
Yep.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.980
What do you think some differences may be

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.020
between Agile testing and modern testing?

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.780
Or is modern testing just Agile testing

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.260
rebranded by A-B testing?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.940
Well, one of the things that I think is,

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.540
I kind of wish we had the show notes from.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.820
And I have ideas.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.740
And by the way, we talked about Agile testing

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.860
before we talked about it for 10 or 15 minutes

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.420
in episode eight.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.260
Okay.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.540
All right.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.980
And you know this because of one of your employees?

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.820
No, no.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:05.490
So the one thing I would say that seems obvious

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.010
is this specialist versus generalist idea.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.930
In my view of modern testing,

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:17.210
yeah, we don't really have the embedded IC tester.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.770
We would have maybe an IC similar to the role

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.210
that you served previously.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.820
Sort of a, I don't wanna use the word architect role,

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.500
but something along those lines.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.260
So this goes along the lines of on a good,

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.060
it's an evolution in that way because

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.700
if I do my job well enough,

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.260
I talked about this on a Twitter rant as well.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.720
The role of, if your role is to be that test coach

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.960
or the role of any coaching job, really,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.640
in Agile coach, test coach, quality coach,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.080
we wanna call it is to work yourself out of a job.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.650
Yes.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.750
So on these, or work yourself out of a role maybe,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.270
maybe take on a more of a generalist role.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.670
You do it for a larger part of the org.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.460
You do something bigger and wider.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.220
So that's one good distinction.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.060
I thought of two.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.260
One is the role may not be needed

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.580
because the test knowledge, the testing knowledge

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.340
and the quality knowledge is dispersed among the team.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.370
The other thing though that I don't recall

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.170
from Agile testing, what we're calling in modern testing

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:36.170
is we place a heavy focus on defining customer quality

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.610
through the use of data.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.730
And that's the other one I was getting to

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.810
is just data in general.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.050
One thing not mentioned in Agile testing,

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:49.410
which is huge to how we see quality being done now,

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.450
especially in the future is a heavy, heavy reliance on data.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.130
Data driven at a minimum, data centric as an ideal.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.170
What I recall from Agile testing

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.930
is still a book on testing.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:06.130
Like what I'm saying on modern testing,

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.130
it's not really about testing.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:08.970
Yeah.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.810
We can look at this as a bit of a maturity model.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.530
Agile testing is the book you need to understand

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.370
how to give you a good insight

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:24.370
and understand how to adapt from a predictive test last world

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:29.630
into a iterative or maybe even adaptive test as you go world.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:32.350
There's a lot of insights in there

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.290
into what that looks like.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.210
So you read it the whole way through recently

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.970
because I do remember it covering the iterative,

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.770
like this Scrum type model very well.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:47.620
I don't recall it covering the adaptive model.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.140
Not directly.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.460
Not directly.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.500
But again, another...

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.460
Maybe that's in more active testing.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.020
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.220
But one thing we've have talked about before,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.740
which is an important distinction is this idea

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.460
that waterfall model, very predictive.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.640
Some people are happy with Agile being just a pure,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.400
iterative model, but I think Agile done right

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.640
must be adaptive.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.540
So I don't see why they...

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.250
While you can get stuck in the iterative,

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.250
I think if you're talking about learning,

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.930
and actually I wanna pop back to something,

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.690
adaptive becomes very important.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.450
When it's done right, I'll tell you,

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.050
when it's done right, it is adaptive.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.670
And the reason why is because when you've done it right,

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.010
you've struck on something

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.330
and you can't scale with the iterative model.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.490
You have to adapt.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:43.770
You have to have a mechanism to cut things

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.790
that aren't worthwhile doing.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.770
Let me give you two examples from Unity.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.050
On my team.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:54.970
One is I have one lead who very good at Agile.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:59.490
In fact, so good that in one of the teams

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:05.360
that he barely works with doesn't have a lead right now.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.880
He's not leading the team, he's just leading their,

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.600
he's just basically playing their role of product owner.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.000
Product owner or Scrum Master?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.010
Both.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.850
Scrum Master.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.030
So he's not telling them what to do,

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.030
he's telling them how to do it.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.870
Correct.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.870
He's a very good Agile coach.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.830
So he's playing that role across the teams.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.630
And again, specialized in generalist,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.150
he owns some quality stuff,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.390
but he's playing the role of a Agile coach.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.430
Okay.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.630
And just nudging,

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:38.590
nudging that word,

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:43.140
live along a little bit and good improvements,

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.220
great feedback.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.930
He's helping those teams become adaptive.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.970
So I love it.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.030
Another example, my most,

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.950
I won't use the word dysfunctional.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.750
The team that needs the most improvement

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.430
out of all the teams I work with,

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.270
I had a conversation.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.230
Do any of these teams list this team?

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.070
Maybe.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.910
Hey.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.890
I am full transparency.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.270
I'm not gonna say this team sucks because they don't.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.330
Do they have some more room for growth

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.450
and learning and becoming more adaptive?

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.290
Yeah, for sure.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.610
And nobody anywhere in the org,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:21.170
whether they're test dev ops would argue with me.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.130
All right.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.090
But the point is I asked this question

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.990
because I'm some,

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.770
I kind of dive in and out of being directly involved

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:29.610
in the different teams

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.570
and all in like 12 different products.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.050
But I popped in on one of the channels and said,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.660
hey, does this team do retrospectives?

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.340
Kind of knowing the answer based on,

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.820
you kind of can tell whether a team does or not.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.620
And it was great because the answer was,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.640
we used to, but no, not anymore.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.820
But then I had a few people message me privately and say,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.580
no, but we really need to.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.700
Can you help start doing these?

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.540
So they're,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.940
each time you wanna make any sort of change,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.580
having allies is good,

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.260
but part of being a learning organization

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.060
and part of getting to an adaptive state,

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.740
like you can't do adaptive software development

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.290
if you don't do a proper retrospective.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.330
Because a retrospective is about taking some time

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.450
to reflect and learn.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.000
Yeah.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.460
No, the thing that I'm thinking here though,

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.190
that gives a clue,

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.940
it's essentially what I find

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.060
is the most successful retrospectives are the ones

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.370
where essentially the leadership is disinvited.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.950
In order to get there,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.630
now this is in the Microsoft mentality

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.630
where command and control is so pervasive,

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.550
it's hard to compare it to anything else.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:49.280
And it sounds different than the Unity model.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:54.640
But if they're asking for your help to get there,

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.940
that to me sounds like a call for command and control

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.140
to kind of nudge in a better direction.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.120
In this role, it's me not as a leader,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.360
it's me in the role of a specializing generalist.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.300
Just a couple weeks ago,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.980
I hit the reset button on my own team's retrospective.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.420
We had gotten a little bit formulaic,

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.300
the team was going through,

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.540
but the team was pivoting around being polite to each other.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.340
And so the really important things

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.700
that needed to be talked about,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.060
like no one ever brought up the elephant in a room,

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:41.080
I took back control and started pointing out the elephants.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.350
I find that my role,

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.710
particularly as a leader in this part,

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:51.650
is I can build a better team by getting the whole team

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.990
to heat me simultaneously in retrospective.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.470
Now, because I'll go,

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.330
I'm throwing you all under the bus.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.810
And it ended up being, I got on the retrospective,

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:08.130
each one of my ACs came after the medium was like,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.930
I am so glad that you did that.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.410
So in retrospectives,

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.090
one, there's a couple of observations I've had

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.090
in my experience with Agile,

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:23.180
which is not as extensive as yours, but not bad.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.780
Retrospectives, and maybe because I'm such a big fan

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.160
of the learning organization,

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.580
I think it's one of the most valuable,

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.310
not the most valuable practice you can do.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.310
And that's probably before-

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.010
I go back and forth between retrospective or standup.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.250
I'm gonna go on the retrospective side for now,

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.530
but the other thing is,

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.570
is that there are a ton of things you can do

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.050
in a retrospective.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.530
There's not one true way.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.890
There's multiple structured models.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.250
And I've found that varying that,

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.150
everything from, there are games you can do,

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.730
there are just whiteboard.voting,

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.130
there are a bunch of different things you can do.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.410
And the goal is not to solve every single problem

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.250
of the team.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.650
It's just like the rest of Agile,

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:06.250
it's a prioritization exercise.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.970
Like what are the biggest levers we can pull now?

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:14.970
And surfacing those and coming up with not a-

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.300
one of the mistakes I see in retrospectives is,

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.620
yep, these are the problems,

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.780
let's all think about these

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.540
and we'll see if they go away, and they don't.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.180
You need to go away with an actionable plan.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.020
Like what are we gonna do?

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.780
What are the next steps we're gonna do about these?

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.340
And what do we expect to see?

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.980
The feedback with retrospectives is,

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.320
that's the most common is,

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.890
hey, we've said this before

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:40.810
and we've done nothing about it.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.150
One of the goals, so I run,

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.290
when I do retrospectives,

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:47.490
I run two different general models.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:50.450
There's two different structure types that I'm fond of.

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:54.850
We do one weekly and then one quarterly.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:58.630
And both have to end with a minimum

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:03.060
of two things to change and two things to celebrate.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.020
And the things that are on the change,

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.940
they go on a particular rail in our,

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.300
if it's work we had to fund

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.740
versus sort of a philosophical change.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.440
It will go on a rail and it'll get funded.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.000
What you and I talk about a lot

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.360
is another evolution of that,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.240
where the pure testing specialist may not be needed

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.720
or is not needed on the team

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.080
because the team gets that.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.960
And actually I have in the dev teams that I work with,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.000
there is at least one that doesn't have a tester on the team

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.920
because of that, they've evolved.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.680
And actually two things have happened there.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.480
You can look at this, if people that have seen this

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.100
is that team one, writes very good tests themselves

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.000
and anticipates where quality issues may happen.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.140
And two, they're the most reliant on data.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.170
Yeah.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.330
So that makes sense.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.170
Yeah.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.380
It also occurred to me that that may be a sign

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.660
of the maturity model that we were just talking about,

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:07.930
shifting away from iterative to adaptive, right?

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.070
Because adaptive, in order to adapt,

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.970
it's about optimizing the flow of knowledge

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.530
throughout the team.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.530
In order to adapt,

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:20.010
you have adaptation is about picking

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.120
the better direction to go.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.120
I think you can be...

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.120
And that requires knowledge sharing.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.680
It does.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680
And I think as...

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.040
But I think you can be adaptive

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.970
without following like we talk about with modern testing.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:37.810
Oh no, no.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:38.630
But I think it helps with the...

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.470
I'm trying to generalize.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.290
Yeah.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.090
Like I think the Scrum model,

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.290
I think the Waterfall model,

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:50.890
I think they solidify.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.850
If you have a testing specialist,

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.170
they kind of solidify those roles.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:02.260
They make it a dependent part of the process.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.740
We've talked about codependency quite often.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.300
Whereas in the adaptive model,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.100
you're like, wait, no.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.620
So when I do my presentations on Agile,

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.250
the term specialist in my mind,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.130
I reframe it when I do the presentations.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.490
When Dev says,

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:28.050
but you're saying I get this from Dev all the time.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:32.290
I'm a specialist and I'm not feeling special in your model.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.410
And I'm like, you know what a specialist is

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.290
in the Agile world?

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.770
And they look like, what?

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.630
I said, they're called a bottleneck.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.260
Because if there's only one person

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.660
who knows how to do this stuff,

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.380
and if that stuff's important,

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:50.080
then your bottleneck's behind their ability to get it done.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.920
Yeah.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.760
Right?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.720
In an adaptive world, you really despise bottlenecks.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.920
Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.380
Yeah.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.220
Fully agree.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.220
Shall we, anything else on,

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.100
did we finish on Agile testing?

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.100
So was it just those two things?

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:09.500
Specialist versus generalist and adaptive versus,

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.640
no, quality versus testing?

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.240
And are those the biggest difference?

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.880
Because I do think,

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.400
because modern testing, when I thought about it,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.520
it was very heavily framed in Agile philosophy.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.860
I think it is too, but I think the differences are,

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:27.860
it's an evolution.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.700
I think so.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.240
And it's, I don't know if quality versus testing

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.240
is a given, but I think the two big things are,

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:38.320
is that the test specialist may not be needed,

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.390
and extreme reliance on data.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:43.510
Yeah.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.550
I think those, in thinking, in reflecting

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.650
about what we've talked about in our discussions

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.570
on air quote modern testing,

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.090
I think those are the biggest differences

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.010
in between what we've talked about

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.010
and where we see testing going,

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.890
where we see quality going.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.610
The Whitaker talk on all this testing

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.330
is getting in the way of quality.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.730
That title keeps on popping in my head.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.010
Yeah, when I read that one,

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.440
that one was kind of a,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.190
that helped put the final seal in the coffin for me.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.230
I'm like, oh, I completely get what he's saying.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.070
Yep.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.870
That really added clarity.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.250
I think that'll inspire some questions

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.090
for the mailbag.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.970
I'm thinking through the world that we were talking about

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:24.490
when we talked about modern testing.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:29.460
I'm thinking the world where it's all personalization,

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.820
everybody has their own little AI bot running in the cloud.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:40.040
I don't think Agile testing is gonna help in that world.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.120
No, no, it has to be, it's a different approach.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.440
And there's actually a webinar

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.120
from the folks at Behave.org,

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.540
who used to be called Which Test Won?

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.660
experimentation website on using AI

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:57.240
to do experimentation in multivariate testing,

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.800
which is actually an awkward,

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.640
an unplanned segue into the mailbag.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.980
We have a mailbag question.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.820
We do.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.460
Which is kind of about this same topic

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.020
that we somehow evolved into.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:16.610
Which was odd.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.450
This time it was really accidental.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:21.410
It was truly an accidental segue.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.290
Brent, do you wanna read that question?

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.650
Yeah, so on the Slack channel,

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.660
Adrian posted a article.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.500
Adrian!

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.670
Posted an article around something called Bandit Tests.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:37.710
And he asked,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.430
is that something you have come across in your job

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.400
and have found it useful?

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.320
Have you heard of it?

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.680
I hadn't heard of it before I looked it up.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.600
And to me, and you know more about the things being

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.440
about the statistician and math thing,

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.000
it sounds like a sort of a variation

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.240
on multivariate testing.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:57.170
Is it not?

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.690
I mean, you're testing multiple things at once

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.450
and you use the results to drive what you test next.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.050
That's the different part.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.290
Yeah, it's-

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.770
So multivariate, as I understand it,

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:09.660
is instead of an A-B test, it's an A-B-C-D-E test.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.420
The multivariate, the way you phrased it-

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.260
Really, it's an A-A-1, B-B-1 testing.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.060
You're testing multiple things at once.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.140
So you can contrast it with A-B testing

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.100
and multivariate testing.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.140
Bandit testing is extremely useful.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:34.140
It is harder to understand than multivariate or A-B testing.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:42.630
But it is something that my team does use in our job

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:48.870
and we do find it useful.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:54.190
And we've actually productized our version of it

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.990
and it's helping to run Azure today.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.740
Dun, dun, dun.

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.730
Did you know it was called bandit testing?

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.130
You heard about it before?

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:09.050
Yeah, actually its full name is multi-armed bandit testing.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.450
You'll often hear it in its acronym of MAB,

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:16.690
multi-armed bandit.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.170
I don't know if I'd often hear that, no?

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.010
But anyway, go on.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.330
But you hadn't heard of that democratization

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.350
until it came up here.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.950
So the general thing on this one is it's,

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.350
they call it multi-armed bandit

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:37.090
because they're thinking about slot machines,

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.370
also known as the worn-armed bandit.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.210
And-

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:41.180
Of course.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.380
I guess maybe not, of course.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.820
That was obvious to me because in the article

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.260
they had a picture of slot machines.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.580
Yes.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.420
So the way-

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.100
I realize that may not be people listening

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.370
but I go, I don't get why it's called bandit testing.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.940
Do you put a mask on?

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.780
All right, go on.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.650
No.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.690
So let's imagine that you're a gambler

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:01.210
and you have 10 coins

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.610
and you have three slot machines.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:09.210
And you can put those 10 coins

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:13.710
in whichever slot machines you want.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.310
But you wanna do it in the ones

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.880
that will pay you off the most.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.120
And so the problem with a multi-armed bandit

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.280
is number one,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.720
you only have a limited number of resources.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.680
Like you start off with this 10 coins.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.120
You can't test everything at infinite item

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.920
which is one place where it's different

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.360
I think from multivariate or AV testing.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.320
Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.160
No.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.400
Because they don't necessarily,

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.880
I mean, yeah, that restriction's there.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.960
You still would have an ROI sort of call on those ones

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.680
but in multi-armed bandit testing is essentially

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.640
you have a limited number of experiments

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.200
in which to learn from.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.490
And at each experiment,

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:09.490
you have to choose between exploiting the knowledge

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:12.610
you've already learned from prior trials

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:16.060
or experimenting again.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.940
So it's multi-armed bandit testing,

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.020
in my view, makes a lot more sense

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.340
when running in production.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.740
Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.960
Right.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.960
Doesn't all experimentation kind of run in production?

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.280
No, no, no, this isn't an experimentation thing.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:35.210
This is essentially a decision framework.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.050
Okay.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.160
So you can think of it as

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.960
if we're trying to choose

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:49.080
between a best resource for something,

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.960
we can look at prior history

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.920
or if there's a new set of resources that come online

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.560
and we don't know how good these ones are yet,

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.480
we can experiment with these new ones to see,

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.760
hey, do we like these new ones better than the ones

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.390
that we've already been using?

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:13.390
So you can kind of think of it as a way to build ML

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:19.470
and do sort of a A-B testing type of system online, in line.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.300
Gotcha.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.460
There you go.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.300
So it's extremely useful.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.300
It's a slightly different thing than A-B testing.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.620
I get it, I get it now.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.720
My head's spinning with, as you know,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.920
the one thing in this statistics world

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.000
I've studied a little bit

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.440
because I've impressed you with some fancy words in the past

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.880
is experimentation.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.080
I think moving towards a culture of experimentation,

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.280
again, my head's spinning.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.760
I realize experimentation is different

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.230
than bandit testing.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.750
What was it called, M-Mab?

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:57.670
Multi-arm bandit testing.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.300
Multi-arm bandit testing.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.300
But I think there is a marriage of ML, AI,

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.940
and experimentation that is yet untapped,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.340
but what I'm thinking of in my head

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.100
is take a typical experiment.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.540
Which treatment is better?

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.900
Treatment A or treatment B?

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.660
Typically the way you do that is you route some traffic,

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.300
some portion of traffic to the new experiment.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.300
You look at the result you want,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.500
whether it's a click or a signup

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.100
or whatever business result you want from that,

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.320
you measure the difference.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.280
And you come back and you look at the experiment results

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.160
and you go, okay, this worked as expected or didn't,

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.680
let's try something else.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.080
But I'm predicting, I mean, it's not too much of a stretch

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.800
to think of a world where you could be a lot smarter

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.400
in that sampling of who you route to.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.080
You could change based on what responses you got.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.880
You could say, oh, you could write some tools

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.600
and just tell like, oh, in this demographic

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.760
or in this part of the world or in this time zone.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.640
If I show you the ad between two and three,

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.380
I get a lot more good things, clicks,

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.340
whatever it is, clicks.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.940
There is a lot of, in addition to the just traditional,

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.820
like do they like it, do they don't like it,

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.220
is you could use some computer power

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.260
to figure out why and when or where

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.300
or how they like it or don't like it

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.820
and adapt automatically.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:31.460
A lot of the A-B testing that's done even today

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.870
is about finding the best least common denominator.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.030
Yeah.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.670
Right, as you were talking,

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.470
I was thinking of other examples.

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:46.660
Like, so for example, is Unity in the cloud?

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.780
Do they operate in the cloud?

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.100
Yeah. Okay.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.740
That's why I'm employed.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.780
Okay.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.980
Let's imagine that,

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.460
so here's an example for multi-armed bandit.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.460
Let's say you need to create a new VM in the cloud.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.780
Okay.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:08.060
And you had some success criteria, reliability,

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:12.180
availability, some other itty, I don't really care.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.470
Okay.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.290
Now, what you can do,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.800
now Azure offers,

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.340
I think we have 20 different regions

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.580
in which you could deploy that VM.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:34.940
So which region should you deploy it in?

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.540
Right, you can deploy it in the one you're already in now

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.700
or you can deploy it in some new one

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.420
that you haven't experimented with.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.820
But once you deploy it, it goes to prod.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.300
So if you deploy it,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.740
you could deploy it in the ones

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.380
that you've already been doing

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:58.380
and with a well-known base of the reliability or availability,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.020
or you could deploy it in something new

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.010
that could be worse, but it could be better.

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.810
And multi-armed bandit testing

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.770
helps you adapt the right strategy.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:12.530
So you go, okay, I'm gonna put one here

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.530
so I can start getting information from this one

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:18.430
to see if it's better or worse.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.230
And then if it ends up being better,

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:24.150
then the ML would eventually,

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.510
as you bring down some of these VMs,

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.430
it would bring up a few others here.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.270
Got it.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.350
It's a method of making a data-driven decision.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:37.230
You have a choice to deploy in this new DC,

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:40.430
but you wanna make that choice based on data,

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:44.070
gives you a safer way to,

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:46.510
well, a way to use data to make that decision

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:47.350
in the long term.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.870
And most importantly, it automates that decision making.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.070
Absolutely.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.030
Which is like, you don't care.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.420
What region is deployed in,

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.820
that's not something you wanna spend two weeks on,

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.100
studying. No, absolutely not.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.490
Yeah, cool.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:09.330
I think we're out of time.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:10.730
We are. I'll let you go back on vacation.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:13.450
But as always, thank you, Brent.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.650
Thank you, Alan.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:17.690
All right, we'll see you next time on A B testing.
