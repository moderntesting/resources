WEBVTT

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:18.060
Hey, everybody. Howdy. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. Still, huh? Welcome to AB Testing. Especially

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.940
welcome to our new listeners. I did a webinar last week and picked up a few new listeners.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.660
AB Testing is your best podcast in the world for, oh well, actually nothing. AB Podcast.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.900
Going gently to sleep at night. AB Podcast is a possibly interesting podcast for those

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.400
interested in software quality. Agile testing and what Brent and I call modern testing. We

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.340
talk about everything from test management, leadership, agile quite a bit, software engineering,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.380
tools, favorite colors, squirrels. And data science. And data science. Look, Brent, someone's

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.880
talking about data science. We did pick up a few new listeners, as I mentioned a moment

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.760
ago from, I gave a webinar on Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Yes. Okay, that correlates.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.600
Because Webinar Wednesday rolls off the tongue where that alliteration did not happen. You

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.080
know what? It really should be. I mean, that works perfect. Well, interestingly enough,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.840
I don't even know which direction to go. The tangents are going to start. I gave the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:34.440
webinar on Tuesday for AST on the use and abuse, capital AB for AB testing, abuse. Test

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.840
automation, give a lot of my rants, got some good feedback on that. I was really happy

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.080
with the way that went. Webinars are always tough because you can't read the audience.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.640
And just to challenge myself again, doing another webinar next Tuesday. Not the next

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.480
week I'm skiing, the following Tuesday, the 27th I'll be giving a webinar. I put

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.720
the link on Twitter, but I'll put it in the show notes today. It's on the future of test

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.880
automation. I'm doing it with Orin, whose name I can't remember, who is the CEO at

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.120
TestM, test.im, who make a tool for applying machine learning to testing.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.420
Nice. Yeah, I need like that part. But yet we have some different ideas on where things

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.100
are going. My ideas are very much aligned with what you and I talk about with modern

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.500
testing. I was a little concerned when you mentioned

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.740
that you're doing two person panel for that one. And I'm like, okay, who's this guy?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.860
But now I feel a lot better about what this panel could be.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.020
And what's really cool if you want to watch it is there will be a demo of his tool at

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.940
the end, which normally I don't like, ah, marketing thing. But he and I, we've actually

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.060
prepped for this thing. We spent some time talking about questions that may come up

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.700
and actually preparing for this thing, which is a new thing for me.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.380
Wow. There is crazy crap going down the diesel end. How does that work?

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.820
So it may actually be all right. Nice. We already have a lot of people signed up to

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.020
help more of the three listen. Brent, again, for the new listeners, I've mentioned

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.740
the three a few times. Can you tell our new listeners what that means?

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.020
Yes, it's very simple. We have three listeners and we affectionately refer to them as the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.420
three. And if any one of you asks a question, we say, oh, you're one of the three.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.660
Absolutely. It's kind of like, I don't know, Jimmy Buffett calls his guys the parrot

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.460
heads. And then Justin Bieber has one. Who is this Justin Bieber?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.060
Some stupid kid from Canada. Yeah, that sort of thing.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.220
I'm going to Canada next week. I can't say dumb things about Canadians, perhaps, are listening.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.420
Or perhaps they'll just apologize for Justin Bieber.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.420
Well, yeah, they have several people to apologize for.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.500
Oh, like we don't? Like we don't?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.020
No, no, for sure. For sure. I was thinking Celine Dion. Anyway.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.740
Oh, Brent, Brent, Brent, we're going to make so many people mad. We're going to have

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.600
two listeners next week. We always have three.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.000
Early on in our podcast, Brett and I would joke about our three listeners and then people

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
would. It was actually our first episode.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.360
Was it really? It was.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.080
Maybe we'll get three listeners. But then people, we kept on stuck and then people would

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.680
go, hey, I'm one of the three. And it kind of developed. So that's where that came from.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.960
If there are other things you don't know about us, you want to know, you're welcome

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.120
to ask us questions for the and Brent trashed hands on this for the mailbag and some ways

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.960
to get mailbag questions to us. I know Brent's going to bring this up in a minute. So I'm

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.280
not going to leave even an ounce of silence in my talk.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.240
So he cannot get any words in. But the way you get information to the mailbag and to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.000
us to answer your question, to give us something intelligent for once to talk about is to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.040
either ping us on Slack. I'm Alan Page, A-L-A-N-P-A-G-E. And Brent is Brent M Jensen, Jensen

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.600
with an E or you can...

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.000
You have to breathe sometime, Alan.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.920
...email me at Alan, A-L-A-N-P-A-G-E. And I'll take it there. In fact, I had one question

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.000
there from the webinar I was going to answer today, but I'm not going to. I'm going to

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.800
save it for another mailbag and I'm really not going to give you a chance. And we're

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.040
going to go on. In fact, the rest of the show...

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.830
I'll just sit here in time.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.150
We also have a Slack group, one of the three.slack.com. You will need to use one

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.110
of the aforementioned communication methods to get me your email address so I

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.070
can send you an invitation. Happy to have you there. All three of us discuss

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.830
things about the show, about things related to the show. It's a good little

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.110
micro discussion. And as I found out this week, some people join the Slack

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.470
channel just to get an A-B testing sticker. And yes, if you join the Slack

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.190
group and you find your way there and you join the channel called I Want a

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.270
Sticker and you post your address, eventually, usually fairly quickly, but

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.510
eventually I will send you A-B testing stickers. If you are listening and you

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.070
posted your... You didn't think I'd do it this long, did you, Brent? If you are

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.430
listening, I had three people post their addresses this week and those went out

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.910
in the mail yesterday, so look in your mailbox. Okay, Brent, I have to breathe.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.870
And in the episode, this episode comes out... Oh, actually, I can't predict.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.550
You gonna finish it today? Yeah, I'll get it out. It'll come out on Sunday, probably.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.510
Okay, so... It may come out... If you're listening to this episode, you'll need to figure out

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.430
how to go back in time because Alan committed to shipping all the stickers

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.190
out today. Yeah, if there's any more posted today, I'll get them out tomorrow.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.190
I'm driving to Canada on Sunday, possibly according to the weather

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.950
forecast in a snowstorm, but we'll see what happens. Whistler? Going to

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:02.110
Whistler. Nice. Favorite ski place. Last time I was there, my 19-year-old was three.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:09.690
I've gone every year for about the last eight years. I really... Yeah, it's my

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.530
therapy. It's how I get through the winters. Okay, oh, is this episode 76?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:23.530
Episode 76. Not that we're counting. So, what would, on your webinar, what was the key

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.880
things people were questioning about? I can post a link to the recording. I have

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.880
to remember now. So, the webinar was about all my grabs about test automation. In

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.860
fact, much of it was based on many of the things I rant about in the A word, free

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:46.220
on Lean Pub. Yep. You notice how, like, I had AB in the webinar, AB testing,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.940
abuse and misuse of test automation. One thing I did on purpose that maybe was

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.220
too subtle is in the A word, that the A and the W kind of squished together a

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:05.480
little bit like angry weasel. Look at you. I'm all... Subliminal. I'm the

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:14.670
Illuminati. Questions were the typical things about what if management wants me

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:20.920
to write UI automation? Well, you can change your manager or you can change

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.640
your manager. Often, in the answer, of course, we talked about a lot is pilot,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.760
use data, don't be complacent, don't be afraid to make change.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:38.140
I... Branch? There's definitely... You asked. I know, I know. That one, if your

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:45.640
manager wants you to write UI automation in particular, right, then you as the

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.640
knowledge expert that he has hired, I think the onus is on you to correct

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.680
your manager's understanding on the ROI of this topic. Sure, sure. And I've told

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.320
the story, I think it was in How We Test Software at Microsoft. Remember that

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.800
book? Yeah. Yeah. And, but I've mentioned a lot of times, it's my very first day at

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.800
Microsoft, I was given a list of test cases and asked to run them every day.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.760
I said, when do you need these automated? They said, oh no, we don't have time to

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.640
automate. But I automated them anyway, because it was the right thing to do.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.960
And I just did it... There are things like that where I will automate it,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:26.020
because I am not doing this again manually. Well, I think... Boy, we could go

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.300
way off into tangent, you want to get to the main topic of community, which we

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.740
started last time and didn't get as far as we wanted. So we want to go a little

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:41.100
bit farther there. Yep. But as far as... We've talked about command and control

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.820
and the spider and the starfish and empowered people and all these

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:50.100
different things. But I think in knowledge work in general, one, management

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.060
doesn't work if you just tell people what to do and just give them exact

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.820
destructor. Here's what you do all day today. We're not building widgets in

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.260
the factory. But that freedom, being able to take advantage of that freedom

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:05.140
properly and knowing when to push back, I think is part of being successful in

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.700
knowledge work. I don't think most... So management as a whole, right, is a

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.550
command and control structure. But I don't think most managers are really

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:22.030
wired that way. For example, every manager I've ever worked for, let's

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:27.340
imagine... I work for you, Alan. Let's imagine I come to you and say...

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.860
Oh, wait. I got this. Brent, you're fired.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:38.050
All right, great. So I work for another Alan and I come to him and I

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:43.630
have two options for R101. One, I say, hey, Alan, I'm done with this. What

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:49.150
would you like me to do next? Or two, Alan, I'm done with this. I'm thinking

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:55.580
these next three things are the next things I should work on. Is there an

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.600
order that you think would best value the business? Right? It's one of those

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.990
things where I'm just like... A lot of the times, particularly I see it in tests,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:12.830
I think a big part of it is the... Well, we talked about the enablement loop or

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:19.210
the disablement loop, where I think a lot of tests is just used to just getting

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.690
instructions and they've gotten to the point that that's how they operate.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:30.130
I don't think... The optimist in me likes to think that's not as true as it used

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:37.250
to be. I know it's not as true as it used to be. So delving deeper into

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.050
Tangentville, I mentioned last time or time before, but anyway, sometime last

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:47.410
month I met with my leads and then again met with my peers to discuss just people

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:52.260
in the org and how they were doing. We're talking about levels and

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.900
internally Unity has some levels which we're figuring them out so we

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.340
don't really communicate them to people, but just helps us talk about

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.570
people the same way, which I think is fine. We're in that part of growth.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.930
But what came out of that, and this is true of levels at Microsoft and

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.450
those are the only two I'm intimately familiar with, although I've

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.930
talked with people a lot about levels at Google and Facebook as well.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:19.280
But the point is that the point I was eventually going to make sometime down

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.600
the road was that when someone's brand new, maybe out of college or

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.200
barely or changing disciplines, they need more instruction. They need

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.120
more hand-holding. They need to be sometimes like that first

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.400
person you described. And then there's a maturity where they start figuring out

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.680
what work to get done and they come to you to bounce them off you, get

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:50.750
prioritization. And then there's that maturity continues. I spent until my

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:55.710
last job, I spent where I was a little bit more of the micromanagy. Actually,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.950
even there I still figured out what I did still define all my own work. It

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:06.140
was just a little more stressful environment. But I spent my last 10,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.500
maybe more years, maybe 15 years at Microsoft, defining and prioritizing

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:17.010
all of my own work. And that was the expectation for someone at my level of

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.850
seniority and maturity is that I should figure out what's the most

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.770
important thing to do. And I was better suited for prioritization than my

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.450
manager was. I made balance ideas off of him for bigger scale things like

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:34.090
that may involve organizational change or affect a big number of people to

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:39.330
get some feedback. But it was more of a discussion and brainstorming than it

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.300
was a prioritization. So anyway, taking the subject away from me, because

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.100
that's not what it's all about today, at least, is that that maturation

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.340
happens. And I expect as people get more senior in their knowledge work and

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.460
more experience that not only do they seek out and figure out what the most

00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.300
important work is to do, but they're able to prioritize it correctly most of

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.740
or all the time. There is, I don't know if they're still active, but one of the

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:11.330
best topics I've ever studied on this is, well, classes rather is situational

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:16.970
leadership, which walks through the manager employee relationship on a

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.290
particular task. And it's very similar to what you just talked about, right? A

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:25.930
manager's job is to direct initially and then try to shift it over to more of a

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.890
coaching style and then get the hell out of the person's way. But I don't think

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:39.440
it's a person level maturity, but rather a topic level maturity. People at any level

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:48.850
at any time are more than welcome and welcomed to with the tools that they

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:54.010
have in their tool bag, identify problems, try to connect it to something that the

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.250
business cares about, and then also bring forward with a solution. That's one of

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:04.890
the biggest things I push my people towards, like look, as you and I have

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:14.600
said on the podcast, ideas come from other ideas and good ideas can come

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:22.000
from anywhere. You have to create an environment in which you encourage

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.930
that to occur. So one of the things that I think is actually relevant to the topic

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:32.810
today. I thought you were just about to lead into it. If ever we bring it up. You're practically

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:39.020
segueing until now. So ideas can come from anywhere. The environmental

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:49.560
context can help suppress people coming up with the ideas or sharing them. And at

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.200
least I, and this is one of the issues with command and control, particularly with

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.800
new managers. I see this a lot with new managers. They go, I am accountable,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.860
therefore I must make the decisions. Whereas my approach is I am

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:13.250
accountable, therefore I must make decisions that are correct. And I don't

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:19.810
necessarily presume that my decisions are. If there's a timeliness stuff, right, I

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:25.520
still hold veto power. One of my favorite phrases on my team. As you know,

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:34.820
I run a, I execute via a Kanban style. All the things we talk about around no

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.620
specialists, no generalists. I live and breathe that on every single day. So I've

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.460
created something. I don't know fully enough of how what Lisa talks about when

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:51.980
she says whole team. But I certainly know the concept. But nevertheless, at

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:59.460
times my team is reminded that I spend a lot of time and effort to make my

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:07.960
team feel like a democracy, but it's not. So it's interesting to bring that up. I

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.440
was just at a conversation yesterday as someone gave me actually a lot of

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.040
parallels here. The one of the people on my team was going over his suggestion or

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.760
he was working with the dev team and I'm, I'm hands on hands off. I'm hands

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.530
on as a coach hands off as far as I think the team makes the decisions. I

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:33.650
will give strong suggestions, but I won't very few if I can recall any, I'll

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.370
bring them up, but mandates like we're all gonna do this. Like let's go in this

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.730
direction. You're on board? Okay. I'll help you get there. So the question was

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:47.390
around setting up a Kanban board. Okay. And I had some suggestions on like if you

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.690
don't, I think if you don't do this, this will happen. But it goes, so it

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.610
sounds like you want to do this. I said my suggestion is you have a way to

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:00.690
handle this and here's one way to do it. The decisions yours. And I realized I do

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:06.130
that a lot. I try, I don't try and make decisions for people even if they ask me

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.690
to make it for them because I want them. One of the things I think helps people

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.650
grow in maturity and grow in leadership skills. I think when you're in modern

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.850
testing and you need to be influential over your team, having leadership skills

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.970
are important. And I found the only way to get good at decision-making is to

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:27.780
practice decision-making and practice making changes that people may not be

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.980
comfortable with. The Heffetz quote from leadership on the line, I use a lot. People

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.860
nod their head. They laugh and they nod their head. His leadership is disappointing

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.880
people at a level they can absorb. And Brett just nodded his head and laughed.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.080
That's what I get every time someone hears that. And it really is. If you're

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:51.040
just complacent, not gonna get changed. If you're, I know leaders who say this

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.880
we're doing this, this is what we're doing, and people are, they're not

00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.640
on board. It's too much disappointment at once. And the right things

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.960
don't happen there either. But you want to keep people, I mean, for organizational

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.640
change especially, there's a level of uncomfortableness where you actually get

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.880
the most productivity and the most change. Something to think about.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.900
There's almost every book on the planet around business project management. We'll

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.260
talk about that. That you make them just a little uncomfortable. You get a lot

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:31.620
more productivity. I often change absorb to tolerate. I think leadership is

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.300
disappointing people at a level they can tolerate. I think it's, to me that one

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.840
works a little bit better, but it's the same thing. The issue though, like what

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:46.080
you brought up with your discussion. And I do think it, this is an

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.040
important one. Like if this individual had come to me, they would have

00:19:52.040 --> 00:20:03.350
start getting my speech on leadership. Because there's, you cannot

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:14.870
come to me and ask for permission to be a leader. Right. It's no, like what

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.370
they're saying is really, can I be the decision maker and hold you still

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:28.760
accountable? No. That's not what leadership is. All right. Shall we start the episode?

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:35.240
Sure. Okay, I'm gonna hit record. Just kidding. We wanted to continue our discussion from

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.560
the last episode on community. A couple topics on the board, but I'll let you

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:47.300
kick it off. So, because you have some notes Brent. Well, it's just the agenda.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.900
Last time we started talking about community and building community and

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:59.940
Alan shared a lot of his experiences. But the question that was asked of us

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:07.740
was rather deep. There's a lot of subtlety there and we felt it was

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:16.990
worthwhile bringing it up again. I don't have the question written down, but in

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:24.560
essence the question was, hey how do I create a community when my target

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:30.640
audience is essentially testers who the person has observed don't see the

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:43.300
need, aren't engaged, and want to be spoon fed. And I think the prior topic

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.760
that we just had, well, it's not as much of a tangent on this one. Did we

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.280
accidentally talk about something relevant? We did. That's so weird. Yeah. So,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:02.700
Alan, what are the problems that you see in constructing a community from

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.120
ground up? Like we did spend a lot of time talking about the vision of how you

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.670
build a community, right? You need to, and we talked about your approach, which we

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:21.370
resolved as essentially we want to shift from a spider organization to a starfish

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:26.230
organization. That's the vision. Now, today let's talk about the specific

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:32.270
context, the test community that he's referring to here, and what would

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:37.600
be the first step. So, I've spun up, we talked about my communities in Microsoft.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.080
I've spun up several, without realizing it, without intending to, I spun up

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:51.230
several communities at Microsoft and then probably the best, as far as the

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:57.050
most mature community, as far as any sort of community maturity model is my QA

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:03.410
slash test community at Unity. But starting from scratch, you need a little

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:08.590
bit of a shared, like what is the purpose of the community? First, we have a nice

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.270
little mission statement you may have heard of at Unity, accelerate the

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.750
achievement at Shipable Quality. I have heard this mission statement a couple

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:20.670
times before. And it gives you a thing to rally around. And then, but even beyond

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:26.790
there, one thing I've done at Unity, I probably do this by heart, but maybe

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.270
three months in, about the time I was realizing it was a community, about

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:35.170
the time I knew enough about the org to want to develop some rallying cries for

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:41.940
us, I realized a couple points I wanted us to rally around. One is moving

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.980
towards data-driven culture. We will use data to evaluate the quality of our

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.420
product in production and use that to make decisions, get us close to the

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.820
customer, etc. The paragraph follows that. But everyone knows that's very,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.420
very important. And I'm going to come back to something in a second. We will

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.000
share our successes and failures with each other and use those to learn and get

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.040
better. And that's pretty much it. And then I use the community, it's

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.800
self-fulfilling, because the second one's about community, but I use the

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.040
community to make that happen. And then there's some tactical things I've done

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.120
to help build that community. And I want to go back and reflect on this

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.800
process with some of my Microsoft communities as well. I think it'll be

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.560
fairly similar.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:29.150
Let me change the scenario briefly, right? Because you have an advantage in this

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:35.420
particular case, because you're the boss, right? If you need to...

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.220
I thought you were going to say you're incredibly good looking, but I'll be

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:38.820
the boss, okay.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.580
The last check that you sent me hasn't cleared yet, so there'll be no

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:54.240
compliments today. And when you have a role of authority, there

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.100
is absolutely an advantage, particularly if you know that this is your vision.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:05.940
My job is to create this community and then get it self-sustained and get out.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.340
So let me finish the Unity story. Then I'll go back and reflect on my

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.140
Microsoft communities, which in no case was I the boss of.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.030
But also a scenario I want you to think about, and maybe it's aligned

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:21.230
with that second one, is let's imagine that Tony, who asked this

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.930
question, hired you to be a community consultant.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:26.610
Okay.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:31.740
And you were going to go to his company, spend a week there, and create a

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.660
thriving community and then disappear.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:34.700
A week.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.520
So let me go through those scenarios in order. So let me finish the Unity

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.340
story. I found ways to reinforce community. And this is weird. I did not

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.900
come up with this idea myself, but the leads...

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:47.620
Beer.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:52.800
My leads and I came up with this, mostly them. In fact, maybe all of them

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.980
at our offsite last August. We had talked a lot about community before them.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.620
One of the things we've done, just sent out the 20th weekly newsletter yesterday.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:11.020
And the newsletter is, in this case, it's sometimes, not always, it's

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.680
just something everyone needs to know. Like, or something about...

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.240
We ship your thing.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.020
Here's our vision. Or no, because it's too many things going on. No.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.820
I don't welcome new people. I don't say things shipped. A lot of the

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.500
initial newsletters were promoting something else we did for community,

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.260
was get everyone together from around the world in one spot for a

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.010
couple of days. That helped build community, helped get everybody on

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.370
the same page, get everybody in alignment on things.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:41.850
A lot of times I just share articles, web articles about

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.570
software quality or about being data driven, about things that align

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.630
with our mission. And it adds some commentary and those are taking

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.510
off. I start getting replies like yesterday, I sent one out and today

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.590
I got, oh, you mentioned this. Have you seen these articles and some

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:01.350
really cool articles? So that was cool. What I try to do, I don't

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.590
do often enough yet, but remember my goal around sharing each other's

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.830
successes and failures. So I try to, and each one, I don't get

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.310
everyone, is to get someone to share something going on in their

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.190
team. Like, hey, I use this. The last one was last week, a guy on

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.840
my team put together, who's also occasionally one of the three.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.620
He was playing with using Grafana to map out web errors,

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.560
50X errors from one of our websites and saw an interesting

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.220
number of 503s that shouldn't have been there. It's a static

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.640
web page. And he dug in and found out, oh, this is a bug.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.820
And worse yet, it's a bug that could be exploited as a security

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.820
issue. So it was just a nice little issue of like, I'm going

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.980
to use this tool and I'm going to see what I discover. Ooh,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.960
look, I discovered something bad. And then here I wrote this up

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.600
on this page in our wiki page on how you can do this yourself

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.920
and test your own stuff out. So it's really good for sharing

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.200
an experience of what you learned. And I like those things.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.220
Those things help build community. So I do some things

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.980
like that. I make sure I celebrate in Slack, in our

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.940
company Slack, the things that people do that align with our

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.660
accelerate the achievement of a quality or moving towards

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.620
being more data driven.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.000
Let me go back to Microsoft. I'll get to Tony eventually,

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.190
where I ran a couple of different communities. Some from

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.150
the beginning, some I joined and sort of took over. For some

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.350
reason, I've fallen back on writing newsletters because I

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:30.030
can do it very quickly. I enjoy writing. I can get

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.810
newsletters people like done. So when I was in engineering

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.110
excellence at Microsoft, I would send a monthly test

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.310
newsletter to all testers at Microsoft.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.470
I don't remember a single one of those.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.890
Yeah, thanks. And we started doing a newsletter with the

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.950
testing quality experts, quality and test experts

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:55.480
community. I would include like bug. It was just some

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.520
ways to get people interested as trying to grow, make

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.560
that community self-sustaining got partially there.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.800
Eventually, someone took over the newsletter for me for

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.080
that community died when TCN died. And I also did that

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.240
much less frequently for the test architect group.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:18.220
But an Xbox also had a weekly weekly every other week. We

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.320
did a frequent newsletter was that one was a lot of fun.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.820
It worked. I had a lot of people contribute articles and

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.100
ideas for that. It was a way to share ideas, tools,

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.380
concepts across the org. I did one of my best April

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.540
Fool's newsletters was was in the Xbox org. I really

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.580
need to dig that up sometime. Really happy with that

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.150
problem. But it's just finding some ways to get people

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.950
together. It could be meetings. It could be events.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.190
It could be beer. But finding a way to get to have

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.910
one you have a mission or vision, a thing you want to

00:29:53.910 --> 00:30:03.100
accomplish together and a way to encourage people to be a

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.420
part of that community contribute to the community

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:11.220
and leverage leverage people leverage the community to

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.420
grow. I think a community is a means to discover what

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.220
you don't know. You don't know. You also get out what

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.020
you put into the community. If you contribute and

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.980
share your ideas, you're probably going to find more

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.940
ideas that inspire you and help you create new ideas.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.860
So a bunch of things I want to. OK. And then I'll go

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.860
on to what I do if I'm I'm a consultant for Tony.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.580
But go ahead and add your your stuff. Yeah. And

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.340
it'll be good because I think it'll help frame your

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.500
next topic. So a lot of the communities that Alan

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:49.340
just mentioned. I was a member of one in particular.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.940
I'm thinking about the test architect group. There

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:59.160
was one phenomenon that that that I noticed in

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.000
that whenever it was the scheduled day for the

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.980
community and Alan couldn't make it it got canceled.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.190
Right. So part of the problem in this particular case

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:13.150
is Alan loves this stuff. He's very effective at it.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.490
But he ended up being the virtual leader. And when

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:21.110
the leader wasn't there it didn't happen. And so

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.750
one of the things why I say self sustaining right

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.790
often is the goal. It's also saying is and one

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.990
of the things I would I would actually. So a couple

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.230
suggestions I have for you based off of the

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.750
experience and what you just described for me. OK.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.930
Create a community of the newsletter producers and

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.890
your first task is say hey I want the newsletter

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.030
to go out every month. I want us to first figure

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.320
out what is the principles around how it's going

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.560
to be built because I want people to look at

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.440
that and not tell not be able to tell that it

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.480
was a different person sending them each month.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.980
And then the next thing we're going to do is

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.760
figure out a rotational model. I was I will do

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.880
the first few of them until we are happy with

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.810
the iteration. But by the end of summer each of

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.330
you guys is going to is going to take point

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.850
and we're going to rotate through and you're

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:24.710
going to own sending this. What you have to do

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.870
is then use that command and control to force

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:32.870
them to learn and to spread the next phase

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:37.300
after that is how do you get them to want to

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.020
maintain the rotational model. It would take

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.740
longer than two podcasts for me to go through

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.420
suggestions on that one. And I wouldn't even.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.420
I'll build on that. The last thing I would suggest

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:58.580
to you is make a key section of your of your

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.380
newsletter. Are you sending out monthly weekly

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.720
weekly. OK. Make a key section of your weekly

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.600
newsletter. The most glorious fail that occurred

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:17.690
in your team and figure out a way to send that

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.130
person a gift card or some sort of little

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:24.010
incentive. Yeah I do agree that one thing we

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.850
could do more of is I mentioned in my my

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.890
principles is celebrate our successes and

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.000
failures. Actually both internally and publicly

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.720
I want to post more of what we're doing around

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.120
quality and. You know services on the unity

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.440
blog and we're getting there. But we don't

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.240
celebrate the failures enough and we I do

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.920
want to do more of that and it's harder to

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.640
get people of course to to recognize those

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.920
and thankfully we're not making very many epic

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.720
failures. So that's good but yes I agree

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.960
those things should be there. I agree that I

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.000
want to add. No it's my turn now. And I also

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.320
agree that. You do want a community of people

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.190
distributing the newsletter. And I do agree you

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.630
want to have a group of people that can send

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.790
the newsletter. Kicking it off here for the

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.110
first several months. I've been happy to do it

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.470
I think it's the right thing for me to do it

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.150
to establish a cadence to prove we can do it

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.750
weekly to prove that we can get value from that.

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:22.790
I'm stepping away next week and people are no

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.990
problem. Stepping in and making sure there's a

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:28.590
newsletter done while I'm gone and eventually

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:32.210
they will contribute more more. They actually

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.770
all contribute the article ideas. They they

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:38.010
they get ideas for articles from their team and

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.320
I play editor. A lot of times. And sometimes

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.800
for light on stuff I have no problem just

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.080
kind of writing a little mini blog post about

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.280
because I read a lot of articles on the

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.200
Internet that I find this to be interesting for

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.040
the team. Let me add a little commentary to

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.400
get them engaged in it and explain why it's

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.800
relevant to our mission. And then they are

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.360
pretty good about jumping in and getting some

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.720
new ideas. You want to say something I want to

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.560
talk about what I do for Tony's team. If I'm

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.860
his consultant. Go ahead. Talk about Tony. OK

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.580
Tony hires me to come in to help me build the

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.860
community. I don't come into Tony's team and

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.820
say OK I'm going to give you a newsletter.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.240
That you only have a week. I have a week. So

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.240
the first thing I want to do is find out from

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.800
Tony what's the goal of your community. We

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.840
get paid six months later after they seem the

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.160
result. Fine fine. All right. Good fine. I want

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.680
to find out what. I would start with why. What

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.800
do you want to accomplish. What's the reason

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.810
for having a community. And I'm going to

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.930
hypothesize that it's we have a lot of silo

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.290
ism people aren't we have people working on

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.650
the same things because they don't know what

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.530
each other are working on. We're not people

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.330
aren't learning as much as they could if they

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.650
had a way to connect with each other. I say

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.690
OK great. So let's come up with a. What's

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:55.010
the mission of the goal for the community. And

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.170
maybe it's we want given that criteria. We

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.290
want to have a means of discovering what we

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.890
don't know we don't know. And maybe we'll work.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.730
I'll work with Tony a little bit. This is all

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.330
like over coffee in the morning. We'll come up

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.420
with. As a test community of practice at

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.160
Rungco widget factory. We want to share ideas

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.920
with each other and use those ideas to develop

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.600
bigger ideas that help us accelerate the

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.680
achievement of quality or help us achieve our

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.160
quality goals or help us whatever have a purpose

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.080
for community have and something that's

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.360
compelling and you think if I told people that

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.160
the sum I think they go yeah that's something

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.270
that we should do. I would start with that. And

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.660
then I would meet maybe team by team depending

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.620
on the org how big the org is now structured

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.220
is I want to get some information from people

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.740
on what their biggest challenges are and are

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.100
their challenges being with their challenges be

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.500
addressed by this community or would some of

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.260
their challenges be addressed by this community

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.460
and find out if the community idea makes sense

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.500
for solving their problems. Chances are it will.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.870
But I don't know that I don't want to. Last thing

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.470
you want to do is think OK we got to really

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.470
push this community thing when it's not the

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.670
biggest problem. Eventually community a

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.910
community of practice if you will at a small

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.550
scale. Someone pointed out an article this week

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.470
on communities of practice I was talking about

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.910
communities at a very very large scale which I

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.070
think is a different beast entirely. So within a

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.470
company that a small organization this community

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.990
of practice can help solve a lot of problems. So

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.910
anyway I've talked to people talk to some

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.750
people on maybe maybe people that aren't even

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.350
going to be in the community say what do you

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.550
expect if we had a community of the testers

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.990
in this or what would you expect that

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.750
community to accomplish that they're not

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.470
accomplished now and chances are if community is

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.350
an issue they've seen things like well I talked

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.910
to Joe and Cindy and they're both working on

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.950
the same thing but they don't know they've

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.480
there's no desire for them to connect and learn

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.540
from each other. So once I have all that. Can

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.740
you talk briefly. Because I think our listeners

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.060
know very well we we care very much about

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.530
learning organizations. But we've also spent a

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.370
lot of time this episode and the last episode

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.810
sort of framing community as something that is

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:25.460
inherently valuable and I don't think it is. I

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:32.740
think community is a means to an end. Sure. So why

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.860
would the business care about you building a

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.620
community. The business cares about continuous

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.740
improvement and I think the business cares

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.900
whether they know it's called this or not a

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.970
learning organization. I think the business cares

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:54.420
that about efficiency and I think the business

00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.020
cares about results. The last one community

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.300
helps indirectly but everything else community

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.670
helps directly. The community helps. I think it

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.850
helps directly for results. Yeah. I think the

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:17.380
biggest reason to form a community is to create

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.100
a means by which people don't know what they

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:24.260
don't know. OK. So community solves a knowledge

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.690
sharing problem. If you if you're a bit you run a

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.250
business and you realize that there is rampant

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.770
duplication of effort you have two choices.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.150
Generally allow it to continue and let your

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.230
leaders run their business as they see fit.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:45.390
Build a central centralized organization that's

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.750
going to be responsible for this duplication of

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.750
effort and force everyone else. I call that the

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:56.790
WTF model. Windows test framework but a community

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.230
is no less. It's more of an in between when it

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:04.270
comes to business results. I realize as I we've

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:08.400
been talking that I wonder if this community

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.960
evolved for me over time and I wonder if

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.480
starting with the idea of I need to build the

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.480
community isn't what I in my consultant role at

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.280
Tony's org isn't what I do. I would actually focus

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.680
on. I would do everything I did before but I may

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.160
leave after I talked to everyone leave Tony a list

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.520
of here's some things you could do on your team

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.960
that would help grow community potentially. But

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.920
I maybe you have to plant a bunch of seeds to

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.800
get the nucleus of the community going versus

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.920
going. We're just going to start a community.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.080
Let me give you an example going way back. You

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.200
reminded me that around the turn of the century

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.920
seriously when I was working on starting with

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.600
Windows Millennium and then moving on to Windows

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.240
CE when I again actually I was a lead back then.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.600
So I had a fairly large org. One of the things I

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.040
did was a weekly it started off as a group code

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.680
review ended up being sort of show and tell and

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.640
it isn't the kind of code review where you'd

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.920
look at every single line and the kind we do

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.720
day to day pure code review. This was more of

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.320
a group show and tell where we'd sometimes

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.440
mostly walk through code like here's architecture

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.000
of how I built this thing or here's how it's

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.520
working. That knowledge sharing a lot of it was oh

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.800
there's a DLL that does this thing you're doing

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.680
or don't you find some more big sweeping things

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.680
those great opportunity for learning and

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.680
sharing. But sometimes I had PM's on my team at

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.000
the time program managers and they would go

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.360
over more conceptual things they're working on

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.720
like here's the way this framework is going

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.280
to work. We had a CE test kit we gave developers

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.120
and a PM on my team in charge of that and you

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.120
talk about the direction and what it was going to

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.160
do for our customers etc. But that show and tell

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.280
we had a community again I was in charge ish but

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.680
that even that was a form of community. So I'm

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.840
going to leave Tony with is based on the

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.880
problems there from his team. I'm going to

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.920
look for ways where knowledge sharing may

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.520
help and I might start right with knowledge

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.120
sharing. You should do this group code review

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.360
thing just get people doing it get it regular. I

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.560
think people will latch onto it. It could be

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.440
maybe we're going to do a test talk once a month

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.160
and some someone or maybe it's Tony starting at

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.240
first. We'll see if we get a few people signed up

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.920
that have some good ideas and we'll get them

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.240
to once a month talk for a half hour we'll

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.400
bring in some snacks get people connecting and

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.480
maybe a list of things that may help build

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.640
community but maybe not even start with the

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.370
goal of community because communities the means

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.210
to an end on becoming a learning organization

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.490
on getting ideas to mesh and learning new ideas.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.700
But I think if I had a week to kind of get

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.340
things going I would and I'm going to be

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.180
evaluated on how things are going in six months.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.180
I'm going to give Tony a fairly tactical list

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.580
of here do these things for the next six

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.860
months. It should take a fairly minimal amount

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.780
of effort. It's going to take some effort. And

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.810
let's see what's in the sea what builds over

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.550
that time. Sure. Sure. I mean the

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.160
value I would add to that I think I'll tell

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.240
you the one thing that I've learned from Google

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.560
and I've still not seen Microsoft do this. Tony

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.920
talks about testers aren't engaged because they

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.920
don't see the value and what you had to do is

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.920
boil the frog here and find ways to get

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.960
people to see the value on their own without

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.600
you telling them. And I didn't say that directly.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.640
One of the reasons I want to talk to the

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.760
individuals on the team find out what they're

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.800
interested in what would engage them and make

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.160
sure we have. I think if you might see someone

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.320
is unengaged until you find the topic they

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.400
care about the topics they care about and all

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.600
of a sudden they have an opinion. Yes. Like the

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:06.510
biggest problem with siloism is since your

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.670
siloed you don't know what other people know.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:16.470
And I can guarantee you in any organization of

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:20.830
sufficient size there are two people working on

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.790
similar things that would prefer to work

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:29.420
together to get it done faster. And the more you

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:34.860
can use find those folks and get them connected

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.140
and working together towards a common goal.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.120
That's your seed. You just need two people.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.870
Two people to use as an in-house case study and

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.310
motivate them to succeed. Google does this

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.390
practice. I don't know if they still do it but

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.860
the weekly status report as I understand it

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.540
everyone in Google every day or every Friday

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.540
writes a status report. You and it goes into a

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.860
public index. I love this idea. Which is then

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.780
searchable. It's searchable. I people can go

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.180
how many other people are working on a similar

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:16.460
concept. Now you don't use terms like duplication

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.340
of effort because that's jurisdiction and

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.700
command and control and gets people defensive.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.700
You cannot build a community of defensive people.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.030
It's just impossible. But you can encourage and

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.870
say hey maybe you guys can learn from each

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.790
other or maybe you guys could kill this

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:40.810
faster. One my particular team highly values

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:45.250
knowledge sharing because I started off with

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.610
pushing command and control. No you will write

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.730
this doc. You will put it in one note. You will

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:53.290
blah blah blah. And then they would discover

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:56.450
like oh crap I had to fix this bug. I didn't

00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:01.750
write this code. Thank God. One note had

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.950
documented who did it. What their approach was

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.070
and what they're thinking. I could go and search

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.070
one note and I got the answer immediately and I

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:13.670
saw it and they knew it's that knowledge sharing

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.190
actually had just saved them five hours of

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:20.760
searching through get. So you start small and

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.960
you begin to break down those barriers and

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.080
that's how you get engagement going. I like

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.600
the status report idea because it's then it's

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.380
very easy to go. It's just scale and figure out

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:40.860
which people have sort of a similar bent on

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:47.360
topics of interest. The there is a great book on

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.260
this topic. It's called influencer how to

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:56.420
change anything. And it goes through and it

00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:00.060
talks about a very tactical set of steps that

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.780
they've done studies on. And if you follow the

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:09.020
steps it's a complex framework once you've

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.100
practiced it a couple of times. I have deployed

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:18.060
it multiple times. It is extremely effective.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:24.420
Their answers or rather their numbers show that

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.580
it's a greater than 90 percent success rate in

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:32.410
terms of executing a change. Influencer how to

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.810
change anything again is the title of the book.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.840
If I'm fine good I'll put a link in but the rest

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.550
you know how to use a search engine. Yep. To build

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.750
a community you have to address simultaneously

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.590
the extrinsic value. Why you're building a

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.350
community. What what problem for the business is

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.650
going to always start with why. And you also have

00:47:55.650 --> 00:48:00.130
to address the intrinsic value. Why is. All right.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.210
I'm going to build the community because I think

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:07.360
Alan and Steve need to knowledge share and that

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.640
the business is going to benefit be more productive.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.040
That's not a very good why. No. But you also have

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:18.560
to address why Alan and Steve care. How you're

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.040
going to get what's what's their motivation.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.460
What are they going to get out of it. And if

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.180
you have a model and an approach that addresses

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.980
both of these concerns and it's going to be very

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:35.540
context sensitive. You can move forward. You know

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:39.320
that it's a test community. If I were going into

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.000
doing a test community I would start on something

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.600
very tactical probably on the topic of modern

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.520
testing like Alan's got this webinar. Hey check

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:54.230
out this cool machine learning test case. I just

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:57.670
spent last week and did your team's entire job

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:01.990
using this tool. Yes I agree. Yeah. Find a way

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.390
to get people engaged and think but first think

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:05.830
about the problem you really want to solve and

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.670
understand why building a community if that's your

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.830
goal or what are the ways that will solve that

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.030
problem. But always start with why. What are you

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.830
going to do with it. And then of course make

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.670
sure people are engaged understand why it's

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:22.710
important for them. We are out of time. I am

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:27.740
still Alan. And I am Brent. Thank you. We'll see

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.820
you next time. Bye.
