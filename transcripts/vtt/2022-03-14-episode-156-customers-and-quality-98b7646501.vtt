If you're not connected to the customer, I'm sorry.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.440
I don't, I don't see how you can defend that you're a customer advocate.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.200
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.960
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.960
Now on with the show.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.780
Hey everybody.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.980
Howdy.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.940
I'm Alan.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.380
And I'm Brent.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.660
And here we're back to our normal intro.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.860
Well, Brent types while I'm talking yet again, one minute in, I'm

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.100
already pissed off at you, Brent.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.560
That's a record.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.960
Yeah.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.360
Well, usually it's no, it's not a record.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.760
It's not.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.120
Unfortunately, it's not a record.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.000
No, I mean, I lasted that long.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.840
Yeah, of course.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.600
Of course, of course.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.960
I was, uh, but I was blabbering on a previous incantation of today's podcast.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.240
When I was going to do the whole thing without you, I was talking about how

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.560
mechanical keyboards have made me not type what I'm on meetings, but

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.400
apparently not you, you're just rude.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.760
How you been, man?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.200
How you been?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.800
Hey, we are.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.880
It's just the two of us today.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.600
If you're looking for our guests, I, I'm looking around my, I don't have one here.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
Brent, do you have one there?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.520
Uh, no.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.400
Nah, it's just us.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.760
Sorry.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.160
If you want to, unless, unless you count that.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.320
Well, Brent has a bottle of wine and I have a beer.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.520
What is that?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.920
It's a Lucille from Georgetown brewery.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.220
Wasn't that, can you write your song?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.180
Yeah.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.900
You picked a fine time to drink me Lucille.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.780
Right.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.060
This is our first just us podcast of 2022.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.260
Yeah.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.100
I think it is, man.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.900
So we're going to have Annemarie back sometime because she was great, but, uh,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.700
here's a secret.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.900
Brent and I talk too much.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.550
He says, Brent and I talk too much.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.390
I yeah.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.750
So let's go, let's go review the transcript.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.550
So here's the deal.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.710
We love to have guests on our podcast, but just to be clear, because some of you

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.390
maybe last time was the first one.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.870
You thought, holy crap.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.230
These guys suck at interviewing.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.150
True, true and guilty.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.550
We don't do an interview podcast.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.430
I'm no Tim Ferriss and that's obvious on multiple accounts, but what we do is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.950
it's more like, you know, remember, um, ah, crap.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.670
What's his face?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.910
Michael.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.410
Michael Hunter.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.490
No, no, no, no.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.690
The one that said we sent him like two guys sitting around drinking beer

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.690
talking about testing.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.760
Why am I spacing on his name?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.720
Alan here with an edit.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.440
I was thinking of Michael Larson.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.280
Sorry, Michael.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.240
Uh, I'm impressed that you remembered it was Michael.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.520
I, and I met him and I feel really, really stupid.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.440
But anyway, that's kind of what we do.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.920
We kind of, it's like sitting around talking about testing.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.600
It's not an interview show.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.880
And if you thought that was rambling us talking too much about random stuff,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.320
if this is only your second time listening, welcome to AB testing your

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.240
home for random crap Brent and Alan talk about.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.240
Yeah.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.880
Yeah.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.320
If you expected someplace else, you probably have selected the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.680
wrong podcast in Spotify.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.640
Yeah.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.760
Or whatever your favorite podcast platform is.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.840
So, um, I don't think it's much new for me.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.080
I have one quick story to tell.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.560
I went to the office today.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.840
Brent is in his office.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.320
This is the second time I've gone to the office in the last two years.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.560
There was about five people there.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.920
I got a lot of work done.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.720
It was weird.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.320
I'm going to try and go back more often.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.960
Uh, but wow, it's going to take a while to get used to the world again.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.520
Anything cool.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.480
And where, where, where is your office now?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.040
Bellevue.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.640
Have you ever been there?

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.360
Didn't I invite you once for a recording a long time ago?

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.840
I thought you moved out of the Lincoln square south.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.520
Still there.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.150
No, no, no, no, no.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.030
Oh, you're in the old, old one by the old toys.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.230
RS we're literally four blocks from the last off last desk I had at Microsoft.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.500
I'm one building over.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.740
Gotcha.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.620
Gotcha.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.100
Okay.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.380
Yeah.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.500
So Lincoln square, I have not been into all the non Seattle people.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.540
You can look it up on Google maps if you want, but it doesn't matter.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.580
I went to the office.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.140
It was, uh, interesting.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.620
I might go back again sometime.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.900
I'd love to actually go one day a week eventually.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.300
And like, you know, for a couple hours, just check it out.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.580
It's fun.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.780
Yeah.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:33.260
I I've, I've been coming into office for all of the COVID period, except maybe a month.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.900
Yeah.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.140
It's interesting, right?

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.140
A lot of people.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.420
So Microsoft is now back to stage six where we're fully reopened.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.480
And for people that want to go back.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.080
Yeah.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.520
Let me show you what fully reopened looks like.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.960
Rent is showing me the parking lot.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.840
And I do see two cars, three cars.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.240
Four cars in the entire parking lot, which you normally I've been to that building.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.200
I, you cannot get a parking spot in.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.320
And what's also interesting is Brent, you have probably been in more, again, more

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.640
information that has absolutely zero context for anyone listening.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.880
Isn't this fun?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.680
How long have you been in studio X?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.140
Four years now, I think.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.540
I don't think in my 22 years at Microsoft, I was never in a single

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.860
building for four years ever.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.650
But you've had the same job for four years or five years, right?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.170
No, actually I am.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.690
Wait, did you change jobs?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.570
No.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.530
Um, are you an S debt now?

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.010
No, I quickly had the load.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.650
I'm like, S because actually we don't even, so SDE isn't even a title anymore.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.770
It's now SWE.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.610
I have software engineer.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.060
So when you and I last worked together, I am now in the job that I have been in

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.460
the longest in my career.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.500
And I think I'm coming up on, oh my God, actually I'm right around it.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.620
I'm either at six or seven years.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.220
Like yeah, this week I'll never, I'll never, and actually given where I'm at

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.580
age wise, I will never make that in my life.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.780
Why?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.680
Because I've been in this job for the current role I'm in for like six months.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.440
And I don't think I have six years left in me.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.970
Oh, really?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.050
Yeah.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.530
So that's one thing I'm jealous of.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.320
Ellen around like he's got like goals and plans for after work.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.340
Like to me, it's just like, Nope.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.020
I surround myself by a bunch of 20 year olds and I kind of pick, pick up the

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.020
same sort of like, Oh, we're all going to live forever.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.100
And to be fair, I'm not, I'm not, I don't have dreams of sitting around all

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.060
day doing nothing.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.060
I think I will never stop working.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.180
I may stop working as much.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.020
I may probably go into some sort of consulting some place where I can

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.020
really, really make people angry.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.780
Yeah.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.700
So speaking of making people angry.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.300
Yes.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.460
Nice, nice segue.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.460
Thank you.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.820
Thank you.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.780
Let's talk about, um, you might've heard about him before the modern

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.180
testing principles.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.620
Yay.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.020
And this is not the first time we've talked about this.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.420
Or boo.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.860
Yeah.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.300
So wait a minute.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.300
They're not modern.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.470
Hey, they're not about testing.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.750
Yeah, we know we're dumb.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.590
Uh, also I remember Brent and I putting these together and trying to think, uh,

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.830
and again, this is for a lot of people, this is old information.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.310
We'll just assume you haven't heard the podcast before for a second, even

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.190
though there's only three listeners and we know you all, so whatever bear with me.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.630
We weren't trying to invent anything.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.990
And to be very clear, I bring this up every time I talk about them,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.150
we didn't invent anything.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.590
We were looking at what was happening to software teams and the testers

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.710
in the industry going back seven years.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.750
And we thought, man, this isn't going to be confusing for people.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.950
Let's, uh, well, our attempt was let's talk about what's going on.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.070
So it's less confusing.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.070
And then sometimes that happens and sometimes we make people more confused,

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.950
but it gets them talking, right?

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.950
And when people, when people complain about the principles and say we're dumb

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.190
and we're full of crap and we're, and we're, um, other words, we welcome you

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.910
to the conversation because, you know, we don't claim to be right.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:22.630
We don't, we don't, we will debate and discuss and give you context on where

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:28.020
we came from, but then again, people come up to us all the time and say, yeah,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.620
this is, this is what we're seeing.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.780
Thanks for putting a name for it.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.620
So there's that too.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.940
So, uh, way back in my context aside, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.220
When we wrote them down, we, number seven, the team paraphrasing, you may get

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.900
to a stage where the team does no longer needs a dedicated testing professional.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.820
We thought that was going to be the one that was going to be the one people

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.820
were going to pin us up on a wall about some sort of threats, whatever, but no.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.140
Oh my God.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.300
But no traders, no people, people read that and they go, and this wild, they

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.820
go, there may not be need for testers anymore.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.650
No, that's not as bad as saying that I don't evaluate quality.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.090
What's this the customer?

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.130
So principle number five says, I should probably read it.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.890
Uh, only that I should probably read it and I'm not, cause I don't have it in front of me.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.850
I'll read it for you.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.250
I have it.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.490
Oh, Hey, Brent, please participate in the podcast and read me principle

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.730
number five, and then we can talk about it.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:23.930
Oh, thank you.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.970
Uh, what a delightful and warm welcome.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.810
I appreciate that.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.090
I am going to barf and then my beer is not going to taste as good.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.210
Uh, the barf on your beer.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:40.810
Um, we believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.570
the quality of our product.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.170
I absolutely believe that.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.330
And I stand by that principle, but, um, as do I, yeah, but, uh, had some

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.610
feedback this week that it's cringe worthy at least, and I stand by it.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.450
I mean, there is, I had a nice conversation with the author.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.650
I'm not going to name names here or even the poster or the Twitter threat.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.050
Because I think it's actually a really good point.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.710
They may like, if you're, if you're viewing the principles as a tester and

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.750
those are principles of what testers do, which they're not.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.030
And again, goes back to our dumb naming of the thing.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.350
And here, here's a fly on the wall when modern testing came about.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.910
We're trying to come up with, talk about the big dedicated test teams

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.070
and how they test quality.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.150
And like Brett and I spent a first trick of our career and we

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.510
call that last traditional testing.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.230
So we, but what we want to talk about is holy crap.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.390
Um, what is, what's the thing that's not traditional, but it's a new,

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.270
we'll call it modern testing and it's stuck and it's wrong, but it's,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.310
but it's what we called it.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.030
Well, I don't have a problem with the name.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.070
The problem, the problem comes from leading people to think they're about

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.830
testing and looking at it, they get the wrong lens to look at them from.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.270
This is around, this is around delivering quality software to customers.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.500
Okay.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.910
So it depends on if you think of testing.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:07.110
So I stand by these are more modern testing principles, which means testing

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.390
in that phrase is an adjective, not a noun.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.380
What are the testing principles that are modern?

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.060
Okay.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.700
And I would say this, this is our stab at that.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.620
I get it.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:20.860
I get it.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.500
So what's interesting, this one is, and again, we welcome the feedback.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:28.060
I'm not, and by no means, if the person who posts this thing, we're not mocking you.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.940
I want to bring this up.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.740
Cause if you're worried about this one, you're not the first and you not even

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.620
the third or the 10th, and you will not be the last person to, to question

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.220
this one and go, Hey, wait a minute.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.660
If only, and I'll ask you this Brent, this, this goes back.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.660
Is it episode 56 where we actually role-played the traditional test manager

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.020
and the modern test manager?

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.060
It's in the 50s somewhere.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.140
58, 56.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.140
I want to, I want to say it was 57.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.260
Could be there too.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.260
But let me ask you this, Brent.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.100
Yes.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.420
Only the customer can evaluate quality.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.820
Then as a tester on my team, what am I doing?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.120
You're evaluating risk.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.120
So what's the difference between again, this is dumb, brisk and quality.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.320
Will I evaluate risk risk to what?

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.780
To the risk to quality.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.260
Ha.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.180
Oh, it wasn't.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.940
No, no, no.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.820
Brent, it wasn't 57 to answer your question.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.100
Which question?

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.060
What episode?

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.660
What, what was it?

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.900
My question was, oh my God.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.580
No, you are incapable of multithreading.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.340
It is 67.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.260
67 was the debate.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:40.820
Okay.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.700
So go back way, way back to 67.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:43.980
Great.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.340
So I'm going to ask you, so as a tester, I, I'm looking at risk, but it's, I'm

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.940
like, I said it tongue in cheek, but it's true.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.820
I'm evaluating risk of quality.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:13:00.540
I am trying to make sure I'm doing my best to make sure that I am looking at

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.920
the software from the eyes of the customer and ensuring that do not, I

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.800
don't ensure anything.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.960
I don't assure quality.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.840
I know that, but what I do is I examine the product to learn information

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.600
about it and evaluate what the customer's experience will be and what kind

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.520
of quality they'll have and give that feedback to my stakeholders.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.720
So we make good decisions about delivering a quality product.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.420
Barf.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:28.700
Sure.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.340
Okay.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:36.700
Again, a little, I mean, I think the barf is because Brent and I look at software

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.140
delivery and software quality as it, it's a team role that if you, and you can

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.100
have a tester on the team, but that's not what they do.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.340
They're helping the team on evaluate risk, which is right.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.420
But what we're saying is it is so easy to build the wrong product and you can't

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.940
build a high quality product.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.500
You can call it the engineering is good quality.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.260
We can say we've evaluated our engineering practices.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.900
We found lots of bugs that customers don't care about, but if it doesn't

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.860
provide any value for our customer and go back to Weinberg's definition,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.940
quality is valued to some person.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.180
If it doesn't give them, if it doesn't give that customer value, it is

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.980
by definition, not quality.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.300
Correct.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:18.900
Correct.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:26.520
I actually think in principle five, there are two, two things that, uh,

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.400
like we've, I don't know how long have we talked about modern testing

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.680
principles three, four years now.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.480
I don't know.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.400
The term probably came up four or five years ago.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.690
Can't, it doesn't matter a long time in my years, a long time, 67

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.670
episode 67 was September 2017.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.360
Okay.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.760
So coming up on that long, cause that wasn't the first time we talked about it.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.760
That wasn't where we coined the term.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.020
Modern testing principles happen later.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:58.620
Yeah.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.220
But we didn't coin it for that conversation.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:00.980
Anyway, go on.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.940
No, no.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.780
So two things.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.900
Number one.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.180
Uh, yeah, it's interesting.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.180
Like even back then we were saying this is old and, and in conversations

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.740
that we've had in the podcast recently, right?

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:14.980
Yeah.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.500
Your, your discussions around post-modern.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.180
Yeah.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.380
Yeah.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.260
Yeah.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:19.660
Right.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.780
And that's just rephrasing those.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.620
So it sounds even less like the tester saying them, but right.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.140
Also we were seeing just for more context.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.780
One of the reasons we talked about this is we saw teams who were getting rid of their

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:36.660
testers and failing miserably because they didn't think they didn't have a plan on

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.820
how to achieve quality without dedicated testers.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.860
So once I talk about that situation as well.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:41.940
Anyway, go on.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.460
I think the two things that, so in that time I've been looking at, okay, what

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.820
are the patterns, what, what's causing people to, to have a negative reaction?

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:52.460
Okay.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:58.350
Uh, and I'll say there's, in my view, there's sort of three things that, that

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.110
pop out of that one number one.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:07.310
And I'm going to go in, in probably what I view is the, the least impactful order.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:13.510
So the one I see is the least impactful is sort of the semantic discussion

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.910
around what the hell a customer is.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.910
Or what the hell, I mean, I would say equally as much semantic

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.350
discussion about what quality is, which is what I think Weinberg's is the one

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.230
used most among the testing community.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.150
There's plenty of definitions, but for that one, I think principle five is 100%

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.820
supported, but anyway, go on.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.340
Don't my number two was the semantic discussion around quality inside your head,

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:37.700
Brent.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.460
Yep.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.420
The, the, that's number two, the, and here, I don't know what you do in your

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.700
stage presence, but whenever I talk about this, I proactively bring up a

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.740
distinction between quality and code, correct.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.820
Yes.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.420
Right.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:59.460
And a lot of people read this will, will interpret quality as a synonym for bugs.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.420
And then, and then they have a negative reaction.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.340
Oh my God.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.060
If I'm not, if I, if I test something, I'm a good test, test something for a

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.900
while and there's no bugs, I would say this is probably pretty good quality, but

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.460
I don't know if it solves the problem for the, but it's code correctness still.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:14.770
Anyway, no way.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.490
But, but when you, when you think of the word quality as a synonym for bugs, then

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.490
you could very easily interpret number five, right?

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.610
I'll just restate it.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.970
We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.690
the bugs in our product, right?

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:37.410
Doesn't that sound like, Oh, we're saying all of these things, like

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.170
the customer should test for you.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:39.690
Right.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.450
And, and

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.610
yeah, but that's one misinterpretation.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.370
I think that's the second most common one.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:51.490
The third one, the one I don't know in terms of frequency, but I think this

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:58.940
is the one that raises the most heat is because this is this, I think about

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:06.170
an old slide deck from actually Alan on this, where he talks about what

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.570
test believes they are, right?

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.610
The champions of quality.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.130
Oh yeah.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.730
I almost pulled out that slide.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.050
Yeah.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:20.240
There's this identity within test around that they are the great

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.120
defenders of the customer.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:22.880
Yeah.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.440
Yeah.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.440
Um, people have said this is bullshit because QA is the voice of the customer.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.040
Right.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.240
And then it's, it's interesting.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.600
So you and I talked about this, I did one of the blog posts

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.450
that a long time ago, right?

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.810
Um, it was, it's titled test.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.850
Doesn't understand the customer.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.690
Yeah, they don't.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.690
And I know I just, I just made a bunch of people mad.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.290
Oh, actually the people listen to the podcast aren't mad.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.090
They have the people are right.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.490
The biggest problem.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:59.050
And when I, I'll let the listeners go and find it or we can post it in the notes.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.050
I mean, that's right.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:06.770
That's, and again, let me just put an interlude there because this is not

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.590
really, this is, I mean, it's where, cause quality is in the, the

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:17.150
hands of the beholder from my perspective, um, or from its easy to see a perspective.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.430
This is not a quality podcast.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.470
Cause I forget to put stuff in the notes all the time.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.230
All kinds of things go wrong with the production of this podcast.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.310
Yet some people find it valuable.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.430
Does that mean it's a quality podcast or it's not?

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.670
It depends for some customers, there is value and some there is not.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.630
So for some, that's exactly it.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.190
For some there is value.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.990
And, and exactly some, there isn't.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.030
And, um, the nice thing, like I think about your specific example, the nice

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:52.150
thing about the community of the three is they step up and fill the gaps.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.830
Yeah.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.910
And, and, and I do want to point out, I think back to your semantic argument,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.070
then I'm going to get let's step out of the way for you to keep your,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.950
keep on your role here.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:07.260
But the quality one to me is I think that's the word that angers people

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.500
because they don't, they think of quality as, I don't want to put my thoughts

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.260
in their head, but they see that they don't think of value to the customer.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.620
They're thinking about, like you said, code correctness or engineering

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.740
quality or all the things that testers are really good at finding before

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.620
things go to production, those obvious bugs, those, even those edge case bugs.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.020
But in the case of edge case bugs, I was at a conference once and there

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.420
was a tester there who was super happy because he played with some

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.100
onscreen display next to a conference room for literally hours and hours and

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.940
hours and found, and then got it to exhibit a bug.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.420
We're super proud that the thing was broken.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.340
It was low quality, but, uh, in the end, was it?

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.260
Cause it was useful until he really, really tried to screw it up.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.860
And I think maybe I'm off too much on a tangent here.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.380
Those edge cases may not matter to most customers.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.220
Like how many customers, how many times have you found a bug?

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:00.620
This is good.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.860
I'm all over the map here.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.620
Well, a customer would never do that.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.220
And we go, ha, they would too.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.620
But today we use principle number six because we use data to determine if

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.420
a customer would actually see that or not.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.620
And in the case of this one, I'm thinking of from the conference.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.100
No, it's not, it's probably the only time it had ever been triggered.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.220
It wasn't a risk to quality.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.460
Anyway, go on.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.740
I'm going to stop babbling for a minute.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:22.980
Go ahead.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.740
No, no, no.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.340
I mean, you're absolutely right.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.860
Like the defenders, I was, I was reffing off of sort of the defenders

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.420
of quality and people can go back and read my story.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.700
Uh, where I came to the conclusion where I actually had a mentor talk to them.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:46.600
And I'm like, Hey, why do you think it's very rare where the leader from the

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.960
test organization becomes the leader for the multidiscipline organization?

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:52.680
Right.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.560
The, the title we used to use was POM, a product unit manager.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.600
And that, that mentor was like, Oh, that's probably one of the

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.920
easiest questions, uh, I could answer.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.040
And he just simply stated because the test isn't the customer or the

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.840
test does not understand the customer.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:19.620
Now I had been a multi-year multi-year, uh, manager by that time, but not decade.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.900
I might've been a decade by then.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.700
God, I'm old.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:31.230
Um, anyway, the, and I'm like, what total bullshit, right?

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.710
Cause I was very much in the mode that you talk about in your slide where I'm

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.270
like, I am the goddamn defender of the customer.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.550
I prevent harm to the customer.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.300
But what he said is like, Oh, well, test test, test doesn't understand the customer.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:54.760
And I sat back and I'm like, it was getting immediately ready to, to push

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.920
back and call him on his bullshit.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:06.180
And I realized I couldn't because I didn't understand the customer.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.260
My understanding was a series of requirements.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.740
My understanding was a series of theories.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.220
We did not have any understanding around.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.260
Okay.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.100
What's the customer going to do with the product?

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.100
What are their goals?

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.540
What, what's, what did they need to achieve?

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.460
How does this thing, like you talk about Weinberg, I, and I've brought it up here

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:35.650
before, um, like one of my favorite quotes from the pop and dikes where Tom

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:43.410
Popendike is said, says a lot of software engineering teams failed to understand

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:50.250
that no customer ever in the history of the planet has ever wanted software.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.020
What they want is their problems to go away.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:04.640
And so if, if you're in test and if you are not, and you do not have a non-theoretical

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:14.080
engagement with the customer, and if we define quality as the ability, either a

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:21.720
value proposition to someone or, or the ability to make problems go away.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.260
If you're not connected to the customer, I'm sorry.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:31.180
I don't, I don't see how you can defend that you're a customer advocate.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:37.060
It's an attempt to be a proxy and the intent is right, but it doesn't actually.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.460
It doesn't make it true.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.020
It doesn't make it true.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.100
And what you said is also why that principle of neuro six is so important.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.260
Why we think you have to be able to look at that data to help

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.580
you understand the customer.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:51.660
And again, without that, even if you're not looking, if you are using the data

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.540
to help understand the customer, you can get closer at least, but

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.500
you're still not the customer.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.620
There is another definition of quality.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.250
I want to bring up a Philip Crosby in a book called quality is free.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.250
Said that quality is conformance to requirements.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.340
So if I were to take, let me, let me come back on that.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.900
Cause I don't believe, I believe that statement is right with two more words.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.260
Maybe one more phrase, a few more words.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.880
Uh, but if quality is just conformance to requirements, if there are

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.800
requirements developed by a product team given to a development team to implement.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.240
And as a tester, I verify those requirements have been fulfilled.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.800
Have I built a quality product and don't answer.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.840
I think the answer is no.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.440
And hopefully the answer is no.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.920
I built the product that works as planned.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:42.840
But again, the caveat I put on Crosby's definition is, is I believe that I

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.800
actually believe that quality is conformance to requirements, but also

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.880
that only the customer can define those requirements.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.520
I like, I'm trying to think through where we, Oh, I like how we talk about it in

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.040
number six, right?

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.640
Where we say we use that extensively.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.040
The second half of number six, we use that extensively, deeply, deeply

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.040
understand the customer usage and then close the gaps between product

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:17.000
hypotheses and business impact requirements are nothing more than

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.720
hypotheses and you can, and I am a data scientist now.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:31.040
I can tell you in the last year, I have run through multiple experiments and, uh,

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.280
I can guess, I, I don't even, and my brain just got stuck because I'm trying

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.560
to guess how many times.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920
I'll just say it this way.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:48.560
The dominant experience when you go through that, at least for me in the last

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:54.440
year is these hypotheses are almost always fail, right?

00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.870
And it's an eye opening when you go, wow, 15 years ago, these would have been

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.150
requirements we would have implemented them.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.430
Whereas right now I'm going through and I'm doing hypothesis tests and I'm like,

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.390
Oh, that one failed.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.350
Oh, that one failed.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.350
Oh, yay.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.270
That one worked.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.910
Oh no, that one failed.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.670
That one failed.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.180
It's, it's a different world.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:24.260
And for me, like no one's ever going to, to get me to based on my recent

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.460
experience, no one's ever going to get me to back off on principle number five.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.370
At least from the perspective in which I interpret it.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.410
I, again, I want to reiterate, I love the controversy.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.850
And I had a conversation with the person who brought this up on Twitter and, and

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.250
they get it now within context and they understand where we're coming from.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.450
And the fact that it's not obvious at first is fine with me.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.730
Uh, but it's interesting to see people.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.520
Our goal.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.040
It was quite, it creates a very interesting debate and I didn't jump in because

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.480
there's people on that thread who I find are toxic to the community who

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.640
I refuse to engage with.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.400
But, uh, so I did not engage in the thread.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.040
I talked to the person personally and had a nice cordial conversation and

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.680
tried to just show them where we were coming from and it was great, but

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.240
there's a good debate on both sides.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.640
People supporting us, people saying, Oh my God, they're all cringe worthy.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.120
How can testing improve the business?

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.800
That's not our job.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.180
Yeah.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.470
That one, that one I didn't, I, I didn't quite understand the point.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.630
I read the threads as well.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:38.450
I'm like, the goal of what we're trying to do here and we have done it.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.610
And it's, it, to me, it's somewhat even fascinating that even as recent as

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.010
yesterday, like it's still doing this.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.490
The goal is to construct a conversation.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:50.770
Yep.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.810
Well, welcome to the conversation that we like to say.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:58.610
Hey, I want to, I want to, uh, sorry, but hopefully not a polarizing one.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.490
I don't feel this one.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.650
No, I, I, I liked the conversation.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.930
I love that people tell us we're full of crap, um, because sometimes we are,

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.450
but it also makes us think about, well, what is wrong with this?

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.370
Should we reward it?

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.290
Should we, should we add more context?

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:14.890
And it's tough.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.890
One comment in there, I remember who made it up because I'm not saying names

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.410
here, but it was really cool.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:26.050
He said, someone said something to the gist of Deming would hate all of these.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.320
And I thought, huh, I used to read Deming.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.080
Deming is famous for total quality management.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:39.660
I want to talk a little bit about Deming's 14 points on quality management in

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.420
relation to the modern testing principles.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.020
And I don't know if you've read these before.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.300
I'm going to give you, I'm not going to go through all 14, but I am going to,

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.380
uh, give you a couple.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.260
And then I want you to tell me if I want your reaction to these in

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.620
the context of modern testing.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:55.780
Okay.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.740
I'm just going to go, should I go in order for the ones I care about?

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.700
Let me try this one.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.900
I'm not going to go in order.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.660
Break down barriers between staff areas.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.160
We're all about getting everyone together.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.680
It's about a quality culture.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.760
Yeah, we're breaking.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.560
That is the modern principles are all about breaking down barriers

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.520
between stories.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.520
Now, one, one thing.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.000
So I didn't see that comment.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.720
Do you think they were serious or do you think they

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.920
might've been tongue in cheek?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.440
I don't know, but man, I want to talk about these because we've

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.880
ever talked about Deming and modern testing principles for, let me,

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.000
and you can just recall back.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.840
I said this earlier, why we first started the podcast and talk about these things.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.040
One of the things in Deming's 14 points on quality management is drive out fear.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.430
Yep.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:47.390
Right.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:56.680
Which, which is why principle number seven is kind of written the way it is.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.680
I don't think we fully succeeded in that one.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.640
Like that one is the one that does scare a lot of people, but we tried to soften

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.680
it to sort of guide like what you need to do, but yeah, I don't know.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:09.960
Yeah.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.640
Can you read the first six words of principle number three?

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.960
We are a force for continuous improvement.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.320
Okay.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.080
Let me, let me read you number 13 from Deming's 14 points on quality Institute,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.760
a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for everyone.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.640
I'm looking at a different version of it and maybe they've collapsed it,

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.240
but the one I'm looking at says improve constantly and forever.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:37.680
Okay.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.440
You know, I don't claim to be a Deming by any means, but I would say also,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.160
it's worth calling out that Brent and I did not make these in a vacuum.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.400
We just didn't sit in a room one day and decide these are the modern testing

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.960
principles that will drive the world.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.840
These are a description of what was going on based on what we were seeing based on

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.760
our study of Eric Reese and the lean startup and that method of movement highly

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.880
on this lean principles in general.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.480
A lot of it comes from there, but it's interesting.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:14.400
The, uh, this, I don't, I think Deming would be supportive is my hypothesis.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.000
I don't, I don't.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.670
And maybe that person was tongue in cheek, but it made me look it up and it

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.110
made me think about it and start this conversation.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.550
So no matter what, thank you.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.110
So let me read you one of them that I'm seeing.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.790
Okay.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.870
It, so I'll just summarize.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:30.790
I'll just go through them.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.510
Number one, create a constant purpose towards improvement.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.950
Yep.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:35.750
Yep.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:35.910
Yeah.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:36.390
I care about that.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:36.710
All right.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.150
Adopt testing.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.230
Well, wait.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.910
So he's got another one called adopt the new philosophy.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:43.470
Okay.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:47.670
But this, the sub bullet underneath that is embrace quality

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.510
throughout the organization.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.110
You mean like having a quality culture?

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:51.870
Yeah.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.270
Okay.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.750
Let's check in.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.510
Okay.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:57.390
And put another sub bullet under the new philosophy.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.230
Put your customer needs first.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:00.750
Huh?

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.190
Interesting.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.870
Huh?

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.950
I could, well right there, I could see why Deming would wait.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.910
No, they may can't.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:13.230
Number three, stop depending on inspections.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:13.950
Yeah.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:14.710
Huh.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.870
Inspection.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.030
Maybe we can't test quality in anymore.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.150
Oh, no, no.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.070
This is like the summary here.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.790
Oh, I'm going to read all of these.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:30.670
I'm going to stop the paint inspections are costly and unreliable.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.070
They don't improve quality.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.430
They merely find the lack of it.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.450
Build quality into the process from start to finish.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.970
Well, this goes back to the fight that, that I'll call it

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:47.930
faux argument against principle one, like testers don't improve the business

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.370
or testing doesn't improve.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.010
They say testers, well, they should.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.210
And testing does improve the business.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.210
The, so what they're saying in, in there's someone else, I'm forgetting

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.290
their name that has the same sort of point.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.690
Oh, um, we talked about it with the, with the podcast with Al

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:10.170
Shalloway, the, the system, the systems theory guy, removing bugs.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.070
Does not add quality.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.040
Removing bugs does not add quality.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.800
You're making some enemies now, man.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.920
No, I'm just saying.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.960
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, we're going to get mail.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.640
No, we don't get mail.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.600
We're going to get tweets.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.120
Who sends email anymore?

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.370
What's the, without that old.

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:34.810
Use statistical methods.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.250
Like, yeah, I love this.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:42.730
I'm going to go ahead and assume that Deming is a fan of the show or Deming

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.010
would have been a fan of the show.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.120
Yeah.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.480
There's one thing.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.880
There's one thing in his principles that I'm not certain how it

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.800
adapts to us.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.320
Okay.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.760
And that is one of the principles is use a single supplier for any one item.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.180
And I'm like, um, does not apply.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:07.660
Use training on the job, implement leadership, eliminate fear, breakdown

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:13.100
barriers between departments, get rid of unclear slogans, eliminate

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.380
management by objectives.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.580
Oh, that's a good one.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.900
Remove barriers to pride of workmanship.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.420
So craftsmanship is absolutely important.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.700
And we're not saying that the modern testing principles and Deming's

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.380
quality objectives are the same.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.500
We are saying that the ones that overlap are supportive.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:37.100
And in fact, I would say none of these, none of these are conflicting

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.580
with Deming's principles.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:45.260
No, I, I, I think Deming, if you were to evaluate more, just to be fair,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:51.480
I think, I think we would experience it very similar to the blog post we

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:57.530
got from, from, uh, Lisa Crispin and her partner,

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.130
the, um, Janet Gregory.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.650
Thank you, Janet.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.050
Right.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.490
When they addressed it and essentially the feedback is that it doesn't see

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:12.550
a problem, it's sort of a summits of we didn't go far enough or there's,

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.670
that we're not entirely complete.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:15.470
That was kind of.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.190
Oh, for sure.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.910
For sure.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:17.830
We never claimed to be.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:24.790
No, but I do think in general, like I don't see a lot of evidence that Deming

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.350
would, in fact, I think Deming would fully support what we've written there.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:29.230
Yeah.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.950
That's an interesting call out.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.990
It is, it is.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:36.230
But what I would maybe put a cap on this is what I want to thank the person

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.990
who had a, who was thought the principle was cringe worthy for starting

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.470
a discussion on it because I love it.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:42.230
Yeah.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.630
And thanks for being, uh, you know, just cordial to me establishing context

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:51.310
over DMS and Twitter and, and, uh, they're going through my modern, the modern

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:56.550
testing course on, on ministry of testing.com, which is available.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:01.070
And what I started to do is, as you know, um, maybe just a little bit

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.510
of business here live.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:08.270
So it's for context is, uh, Brent and I, this is not, we don't do this for any

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.750
other, what we just like talking about this stuff.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.310
And we hope it helps a few people.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.830
Uh, we're in it to make money.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.190
Occasionally we'll do an ad.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.670
I do this ministry testing course.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:22.630
We, uh, donated some money last year to, um, a couple of worthy causes.

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.070
We have a little bit of a bank account from money I've received

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.510
from talks around modern testing.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.510
So anything I do around modern testing, I just put that money back into

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.870
our, our AB testing account.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.350
And we'll use that for good causes scholarships, hopefully someday.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:42.430
So with the course, uh, there's a new option from modern tech from ministry

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.390
of testing, which is great.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.870
When they get my dividends for the course every quarter, I just don't

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.390
date them straight back because ministry of testing is fricking awesome.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:54.990
And they, I know they'll put it to absolutely good use to improve the

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.110
community and just, just big fans.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.110
So those of you that taken the course, even I love it, you take in the course

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.990
and you go, wait a minute, I'm on day one and I hate it, but I'm going

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.550
to keep taking it and see where it goes.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.350
Thank you for doing that.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.030
I think it's great.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.990
And then if you have conversation about it, uh, there is a forum on ministry

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.750
of testing, but if you want to bring it to Twitter and have us get involved

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:20.200
there or, or, or, or you can go to one of the three dot slack.com.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.280
And if you want an invite, all you have to do is go to modern testing.org

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.080
and pay how much money, Brent?

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.440
Zero.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.040
Zero.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.840
We don't do that.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.840
We don't do that stuff.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.160
So if actually, if you want to go to anchor and, uh, you know, be a, some,

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.440
whatever anchors version of Patreon is, you can just know if you

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.960
want to do that, you can, we never asked for it.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.040
Uh, and I'm not asking for it now, but if you feel obliged, you go, oh my

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.080
God, this is so great.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.800
I want these guys to just to determine where they're going to donate money

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.880
for me, if that's like a thing, uh, we can do that for you.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.200
All our proceeds.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.640
In fact, we would be a nonprofit org, except that requires way too much paperwork.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:56.440
Yeah.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.800
And I'm, and I'm, and I'm super lazy, super lazy.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.760
No, it is.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.200
If someone wants, if one of the three wants to sign up and set that up,

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.840
yeah, we'll, we'll support that.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.880
But yeah, no,

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.800
yeah, I'm way lazy.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.520
So anyway, uh, we'll yeah, that's, we're not a, no, it's too much work.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.800
I got a file paperwork.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:15.960
Yeah.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.440
If someone wants to do that, if one of the three happens to be an accountant and

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.190
wants to set us up as a full time, a nonprofit, whatever those letters,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.470
numbers, the combination that is, we can do that.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:27.910
But anyway, we're here for you.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.110
And so if you want to engage with us, have conversations, disagree with us,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.230
fight with us, you can do so on Twitter.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.990
You can do so with me because Brit's never on Twitter anymore.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.830
You can do so in one of the three.slack.com go to modern testing.org.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.910
Again, I get there.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.030
If you want to, uh, no, don't come to my house.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.830
That'd be weird.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.310
Um, how well should they engage with us?

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.950
That it kind of Twitter or Slack?

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.950
I think Twitter and Slack are the best ones.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.310
Yeah.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.430
But we, you know, welcome to the conversation.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.150
We're happy to be, you know, we're going to argue our side,

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.910
but tell us how we're wrong.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.950
We're not going to, we're not going to get mean.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.070
We're not going to start pulling out random philosophical points.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.230
We're just going to talk about the context where we're coming from and make it to

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.390
a point we agree or disagree.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.030
And that's cool too.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:10.870
Yeah.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:15.790
It's it's, I would, I would say if you want to have a conversation,

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:20.150
have a conversation, if you want it, if you want to shout at us, you know,

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.750
um, fine Alan on LinkedIn.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.950
Yeah.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:23.870
Hey, Brent, I lied.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:28.270
There is one more way that you can converse with us.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.910
There is Twitter and the slack, but for, if you're up for it again,

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.950
you know, from our interview shows, we don't, we're not,

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:39.070
mean that if you want to come on the podcast and have like a longer in conversation

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.750
about this, we're reasonable and nice.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:48.430
So we're happy to have almost almost anyone on the podcast.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.750
I can think of one previous guest.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.670
We're going to say no to it's not Annemarie.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.230
Annemarie is welcome anytime.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.310
In fact, I should just give her the link.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.950
It'd be great.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:58.550
She just showed up and said hi for like 10 minutes once in a while.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.950
Like she's free on a Saturday in Australia kind of shows them.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.470
He goes, Hey, Brett, now, and how you doing?

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.990
And we'll check in for a little bit and she can get us a few more downloads

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:08.830
like she did last time and she can go back to her day.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:15.550
I'm happy to, to, I'd be happy to do that for almost all of her.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:16.070
Yeah.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.070
In fact, if either one of us can't make it, which the other one should

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.590
just do the podcast with Annemarie.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.310
Ooh, another a,

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:23.710
all right.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.070
I can, I can't make it.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.070
I'm on vacation.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:30.430
Hey everyone, it's Annemarie and I'm Brent and it's the A B testing podcast.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.830
Yeah.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.110
Yeah.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:32.390
Yeah.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.390
Uh, except for if you're on vacation.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.520
Oh, I have the recording equipment.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.560
We're kind of, we're kind of screwed.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.160
Yeah.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.040
The, the, the only thing I don't know if you've forgotten this.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.680
I still have this.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.160
What?

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.720
Oh, this is, I need to look at this for the, I think we're going to close

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.880
here in a second, but I've been looking all over my house for the good

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.200
microphone and I think, uh, Brent has it with him.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.330
What does that microphone say on it?

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.920
Are they the same?

00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.920
Are those both?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.360
Oh, the one in the middle.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:01.960
What does that say?

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.780
It says sure.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.580
Beta 80 58.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.060
Yeah.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.340
That's my good mic.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.700
That's the beta 58.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.980
That's the, yeah, he's licking it.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.940
That's the really good mic.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.580
I wanted that.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.540
I couldn't find, I tore my house apart for getting you had that bag.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.940
I got a couple cheap mics and one beta 58.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.600
Were you looking for an 80 bitty C cable?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.200
Um, I wasn't looking for it, but I knew you had it.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:27.880
No.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.240
All right.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:29.480
Okay, man.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.840
Well, someday, someday.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.000
Why don't I, you know,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.440
what here's the geeky part and as we close here, I usually play D and D right

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.480
after this podcast.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.600
So, um, my Friday D and D games have been gone for about four years, maybe five

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:41.920
years.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.440
So, uh, but someday we should record a podcast together like in the same room.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.160
Oh, you want to do that again?

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.000
We could do, we could do that again someday.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.360
Then I can get my shit back.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:52.660
All right.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:52.980
You know what?

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.660
People are bored.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.500
And so we should just, this was fun.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.700
Maybe just call it a day and, uh, let everybody get on with their lives.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.580
What do you think, Brent?

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.100
Fantastic.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:03.980
All right.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.420
Well, this was fun.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.140
Again, we appreciate your feedback.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.940
We love your feedback.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.780
Thank you so much.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.780
And I hope you found some interest or excitement in here.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.140
And some of you are going, Oh my God, I got to go find this thread on Twitter.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:15.980
Believe me.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.820
This conversation, I mean, the threads fine, but the conversations, what

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.900
matters, thank you everyone.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:27.700
If you've listened this far and thank you, Brent for enduring our car.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.260
I would, I don't know.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.900
What did you bring to the table this time?

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.140
I showed up.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:31.660
Yeah.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.180
And you had better, you had a better Deming page than I did too.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:34.820
So that's good.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.720
Uh, yeah.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.040
And I had perspective.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.480
Yeah, I don't have that.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.920
I'm just a crotchety old man.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:42.340
Okay.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.580
I am crotchety old Alan.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.620
And I'm not.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.020
All right.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:47.740
I'll see you later.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:48.620
Bye.
