to deliver with fast feedback loops and count on fast feedback loops and rely and use those

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.720
as part of the way you deliver.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.320
That's a big, that's a, that's a jump.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.540
That's a, that's a lock step jump in your maturity and your capability and your quality.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.060
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.220
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.860
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.620
Now on with the show.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.500
Oh, Hey, Oh, Hey, uh, yeah, I'm Alan.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.780
I'm Brent and that was the AB testing podcast.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.820
Thanks everybody.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.420
All right.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.180
No, no, I got it backwards.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.860
I got it backward.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.180
I'm confused.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940
This is welcome.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.700
Welcome to the AB testing podcast.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.300
Oh, I thought we were just doing one really short this time.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.580
Actually, I liked the shorter podcast, but that may be a little bit too short, a little

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.620
bit too short.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.820
It is, I'm going to touch on something.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.340
I have so many things to talk about and share with our audience.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.980
I promise as usual by 10 minutes in, we're going to get to the regular topics,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.580
but, uh, so I will time box that, but how have you been, Brent?

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.300
What's going on with you?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.700
Anything new and exciting in your world?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.940
We're just a few weeks away from reward release.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.740
Wait, is Microsoft doing rewards this year?

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.940
I thought there was something like they weren't.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.620
Well, uh, they claim they are.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.060
I mean, no one's getting a raise.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.500
Oh, but you get like the normal Microsoft bonuses and et cetera.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.140
Well, that's the question.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.860
Or maybe.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.780
So maybe, yeah.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.380
Um, should hunger games.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.260
Just put a pile of money and let people fight it out.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.580
Being old and that is shape.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.620
I'm, I'm certain I don't like that idea.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.140
No, you could do it like do it a Microsoft way, do it like a elite code

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.340
competition to see who, no, don't even do that.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.100
That would be done.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.700
All right.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.940
Well, that's always exciting.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.820
That is always the fun part, you know, peak in May, as they say, as I've said.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.980
Right.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.420
We are in the middle of July.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.460
It has been Seattle warm here in the eighties.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.030
Yeah.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.030
Do you have AC?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.070
I do.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.830
I, well, I do.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.470
And I don't, and I'll get to that in a minute.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.910
No, don't, don't, don't, don't.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.790
Hey, it is.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.350
But before I get to that, are you ready for this weekend?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.920
Yes.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.480
No, maybe.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.800
Why do you ask?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.400
So I have seen the meme around how F up this weekend's going to be.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.040
Yeah.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.120
If you live or intend to go to Seattle.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.280
I, along with five teenagers will be at the Taylor Swift concert tomorrow.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.720
Oh, okay.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.040
So are you, are you leaving right after this podcast?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.560
No, I, no, I actually was cheapest way to do it was to book a flight from

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.120
Seattle, which is the airport south of Seattle up to Vancouver, Canada, and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.640
jump out of the plane partway through and parachute to the stadium.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.600
Cause there's no other way to get downtown because there's a Mariners

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.480
game at the same time.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.560
Oh no, you do not understand.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.080
I'm going to load up.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.280
I'm saying we don't, while Brent is bringing up his, his webpage of

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.360
information for me.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.760
Yeah.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.520
It's going to be a wild weekend in Seattle.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.360
It's going to be hot.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.720
It's going to be, I don't know how well I do know how we're going to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.360
get to the stadium, but I feel like, Oh, it'll be after the show by

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.320
the time people hear this.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.280
So, uh, going to get on the light rail somewhere, not sure where, but

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.000
somewhere, cause they're running extra trains.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.260
That's going to be the way in, uh, and likely from the south.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.820
Because I think I normally do light rail from, from Northgate mall.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.500
Yeah.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.020
That's an option.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.370
I just feel like 30,000 people going to the concert who live anywhere

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.250
on the North end of Seattle and, and nor a North from there will be

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.410
taking light rail from the North gate mall.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.090
And this is, uh, Brent's ceiling of his office.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.490
Okay.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.610
He's showing there's a thing.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.570
There's a little map cartoon drawing thing that shows that there are 87,000

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.050
different events going on.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.570
One of the bridges is closed.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.730
It's going to be wild.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.410
I'm going to be part of that wildness.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.930
I will let you know how it goes.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.570
I'll let you know in two weeks when we record again, I will let you know.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.560
What happened as I brought five teenagers to a Taylor Swift concert and survived.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.200
Or, or, or this is the last podcast ever.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.400
You're doing this Saturday, Saturday.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.640
Yeah.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.680
Okay.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.150
So Taylor Swift Saturday, uh, Mariner's game, Saturday bite of Seattle all

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.590
weekend, the Seattle storm Saturday.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.630
Uh, the bridges out to see what else.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.110
Yeah.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.630
For the first time since 2019, Seattle will look like it's an

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.230
actual city where people are.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.070
And apparently Capitol Hill's having a block party on Saturday.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.550
Yeah.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.030
Yep.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.310
So, uh, speaking of Capitol Hill, uh, I have mentioned many times before

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.990
segue, uh, on this podcast that once, uh, and, and probably to you more times

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.310
that the plan has always been to get the hell out of suburbia as soon as

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.430
the youngest child goes off to college.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.020
Yes.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.120
Getting out of, uh, getting out of the burbs, uh, bought a house on Capitol Hill.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.800
Oh, okay.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.000
You did the new, so we're going from a 20, a house built in

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.840
2018 to a house built in 1904.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.760
I was going to say 1820.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.920
So no, no AC currently in the new house, but by the time we move in, which

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.440
will be September, we're kind of past the major heat, so I'll deal with that.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.400
Later.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.520
But, uh, excited going to be, going to be fun.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.240
It just kind of happened.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.080
We're doing kind of the casual looking and maybe this house, no, maybe this house.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.360
No.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.800
Well, this one, if we can, well, we'll put it off right now.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.440
What the heck?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.320
And it worked out.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.240
So we're good to go and, uh, closing like August, middle of

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.440
August, end of August sometime.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.000
We're going to plan.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.680
I got a, I got to move in before September 13th or so, because I'm going

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.200
on that walk around Mount Rainier in September.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.160
I want to get it done before then.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.120
Yeah.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.320
So that's exciting and new.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.760
That is exciting and new.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.200
I mean, it's, it's not a goal I share.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.760
No, a lot of people don't want to be in Seattle.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.440
You know, I spent so much of my life there.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.680
I want to go back and I, and here's the deal.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.520
We originally thought we'd move back downtown and this was the plan back in

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.640
the 20 teens when people actually lived in downtown and it just, this is don't,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.480
it's a ghost town except for this weekend.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.680
So maybe someday, maybe someday still.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.680
So, uh, for those that don't know the geography Capitol Hill is, you know,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.560
it's a 20 minute walk from downtown, but it's just up one of the hills and it's

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.560
doing okay, recovering from the pandemic.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.360
Few places have closed down, but there are still a good number of

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.440
excellent restaurants and bars and cool places to what gyms and grocery

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.120
stores that are, that are walkable parks, et cetera.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.040
So should be pretty good.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.280
No, that's it.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.440
And we're, we're only about eight and a half minutes in.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.680
So should we go ahead and, uh, talk about subjects people care about or

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.560
anything else you want to cover?

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.960
Uh, yeah, we can do that.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.600
I mean, that that'll be fun and new.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.040
Oh, uh, to do like a podcast about stuff about A's and B's and testings.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.200
Exactly.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.720
All right.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.240
Well, I, an article title caught my eye this week.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.920
It was called is software testing a dying profession.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:45.050
And we have different answers and we've talked about our answer a lot.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.070
Right.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.390
Right.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.510
The article didn't really go into that.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.300
It said it's going away because of codeless automation and

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.820
DevOps and agile development.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.100
How old is agile now?

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.190
Uh, it's, it's, it's old.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.830
They can buy a, they can buy a beer, right?

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.750
We could be, yeah, absolutely.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.870
We could be its father.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.150
Again, to argue against this article.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.190
Agile development, agile development around for a long time.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.390
And this is what you and I saw.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.990
So it's interesting that you and I saw 15 years ago, Hey, this is going to

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.590
make the need for a dedicated testing specialist and less so we began

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.310
AB testing and modern testing.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.510
And we wanted to talk about this transition for a lot of people, but we

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.430
haven't seen that change happen in the last 15 years and it could be happening,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.630
but it's not happening at a pace.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.730
Well, at any pace it's happening, but not at a pace is impacting

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:43.530
testers because so many companies are again, maybe based on context,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.650
maybe based on legacy.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.410
They're happy to test the old way.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.210
I don't want to work that way anymore, but I think testing will continue to exist.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.090
AI and machine learning and testing.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.810
And again, my line is AI isn't taking away anyone's job.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.130
People that know how to use AI are.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.250
Yes.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.650
Again, when we started this podcast, I could do it now.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.490
Uh, monster.com.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:18.810
When we started this podcast, one of the things I noted was, uh, there were still

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.490
club all jobs.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.870
Um, I bet there still are.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.810
And just a quick search shows that there still are.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.090
I was right.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:29.890
Yeah.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.290
Mainframe developer.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.450
It was just opened one day ago.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.370
I may or may not know someone on the podcast who's working in a company that

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.330
has AS 400s just, um, as an aside.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.130
Well, you and I have worked on AS 400s and, or at least I have the question

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.410
is, I think of it kind of like, you remember limits in math class?

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.690
Yes, I do.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:56.210
Holy cow.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.570
Right.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.890
It limits.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.810
Like I, I forgotten most of math, but I remember those.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.770
Limits.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.010
Right.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:10.620
It's this concept that it never actually reaches this number, but, um, we might as

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.780
well call it it's that value.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.500
Yes.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:13.940
Yes.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Testing will never actually be dead, but do I think it will be at a point where we

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.580
might as well just call it that?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.040
Probably.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.560
I think that it's interesting.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.880
And I think, well, on one hand, that would be my belief based on what we've

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.240
seen, I think it's slow.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.200
I think it will ebb and flow and the people that, so I want to talk about

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.080
the article first and the reaction to it.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.080
And then the article is a little bit straw manage and that's fine.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.440
I'm glad to see it brought up.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.880
I also feel like it's a little click baby because it's almost written to get

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.520
the reactions from people who make their living, not just being testers, but

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.440
being trainers and workshoppers and people who make their money off of

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.600
people who do software testing full time every day and only software testing.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.120
So it hits them right in the pocket book.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.960
So they made, and what I saw, and I'm not going to recap names or comments,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.720
but what I was interesting, I thought it was a straw man article.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.280
And the comments to the article I saw were largely straw man reactions.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.680
And that could never be true because of this thing.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.800
That's only true for me.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:25.880
Right.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.560
Not, uh, or, or, well, what about medical devices and finance?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.120
I got it.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.680
What about NASA?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.520
What about airplanes and all this stuff?

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.440
Like if someone's going to die, you know, blah, blah, blah.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.480
So let me bring up, this is hot off, not the agenda.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.120
There's another Slack I'm in.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.560
I don't know if anybody on that Slack listens to this podcast, but

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.640
there's a testing channel there that I usually ignore.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.560
And then someone brought up.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:12:02.150
So it started with a comment on how Cyprus may not be in, I'm not sure if it's true

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:07.670
or not, but may not be in business long-term because, uh, they're just,

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.150
they're model and Cyprus is one of the UI automation tools.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.750
It's, I like it certainly better than Selenium, but they may not be actually

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.430
creating enough revenue to keep it going.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.110
I'm not quite sure what, how much truth is there, whether it was

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.710
opinion or whatever, but the, uh, the Twitter post was around like

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.190
Cyprus is closing down and that kick off a discussion that I ignored until

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:34.030
it got into a conversation around the absolute necessity of UI automation.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.950
And again, we've talked about this forever, but I made my point.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:43.150
I've been saying, I looked this up for 15 years, 15 years.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.830
I've been saying the following thing and people agree with me when I say it,

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.870
but it does not change.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:55.550
Our industry has an unhealthy infatuation with UI automation.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:02.870
Oh, well, I, I, I, I'm preaching to the AB testing choir right now.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.310
Right.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.670
I was just like, no.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.950
So, so let me add some drama and push back.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.750
Like, what did you say?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.830
Unhealthy, unhealthy infatuation with the UI automation.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.150
Yeah.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.350
I think that's bullshit.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:21.150
I think it's like a way, tragic, tragic sickness.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:21.790
Okay.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.350
Fine.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.150
Right.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.630
Something on those lines.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.470
And maybe 15 years ago is an unhealthy infatuation today.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.630
Maybe it is a tragic sickness.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.590
Yeah.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.310
Of UI automation and unhealthy.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.710
I think the difference is like the person who's been told he's dying from cancer

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.710
in six months versus the person who eats a little bit more sweets than they're

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.030
supposed to, right?

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.510
No.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.670
So it's funny.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.630
And I brought this up before and I want to move on to the, uh, to some

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.630
more stuff about the article, but I remember I posted that on LinkedIn once

00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:01.350
in response again, I don't 99% of the, of the posts I see on LinkedIn

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.710
that I want to jump in on because I think they're just blatantly wrong.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.310
I don't bother because I just don't want to deal with it.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.630
There's no reason for me to fight that fight anymore.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.590
I am so moved on, but sometimes I go, you know what?

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.630
I want to share my thoughts here.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:20.430
Once I shared this exact same comment and then, uh, or yeah, I think

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.550
it's probably the exact same thing.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.870
And again, I got some folks on the other side, the folks that believe in that

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.190
there will always be a massive number.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.910
Cause it needs to be for their livelihood.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.750
Uh, uh, armies of dedicated testing specialists agree with that because

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.670
again, they're also anti, yeah, it's a big generalization.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.670
This particular person, anti-automation in general.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.030
But again, we agreed on that point.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:50.470
And an argument I got was one is, you know, it's two, it depends on business.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.670
It's the whole depends on business context thing.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.030
And well, maybe you have to test the UI because of blah, blah, blah.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.070
And you know, my argument against it is, well, if you, if you really, if you

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.870
have to test through the UI, you have other stuff to fix, but they say,

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.910
we can't fix that.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.510
So people, they dig a hole, dig an excuse.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.390
No, no, but to be clear, you do have to test through the UI.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.670
You don't automate test through UI.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.150
That's frigging stupid for sure.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.350
But there was another thing I wanted to throw at you.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.910
Well, actually, actually with one exception, which you have recently talked

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.510
about and they talk about in this article, right?

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:33.990
Which is the codeless automation, which, which, which is a bizarre concept, right?

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.990
And it's really just a fancy term.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.590
I believe it's a fancy term for record and playback.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.430
Yes.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.390
Which I think today's record and playback is so much different than the

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.310
horrid record and playback from the future.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.070
In fact, I'm going to read the whole comment I wrote.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.740
I wrote two lines.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.260
I will take this moment to restate something I've been saying for the last 15

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.860
years, our industry has an unhealthy infatuation with the UI animation.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.980
Second sentence.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.980
In my opinion, the record and playback of today is more than sufficient for

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.980
any web UI testing and that any need for extensive UI tests written in

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.940
Selenium Cypress Cafe could probably benefit more from a rearchitecture

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.300
than a bunch of fragile tests.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.940
Amen, brother.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.700
Not surprising, but I want, I want to throw a comment at you for, uh, someone

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.860
who I respect a lot said, personally, I feel like the infatuation with

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.100
UI tests, these, my words is great, is a manifestation of Conway's law.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.620
Conway's law is what it says your organization will match your architecture.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.900
So when you hire a bunch of S debts, you end up people who will

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.500
write them because they own them.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.500
Which becomes status-cool overall, because people associate QA testing with

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.900
rights tests and the most common ones that anyone with a QA title write up

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.900
end up being UI tests.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.500
So it's a going back to, this brings us back to the article because we have

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.180
testers and because testers don't want to do bullshit testing, they end up

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.700
writing a bunch of UI automation because it's almost what that's what

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.820
they're expected to do.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.690
We have this maybe I'll hypothesize here.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:09.810
We have a self-fulfilling prophecy where we have a bunch of these fragile UI tests

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.290
cause that's what the testers are supposed to, these testers are supposed

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.570
to write and it circles and it's one of the circles of hell.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:16.720
Right.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.360
It's essentially, we have to do this.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.320
Like if you boil it down, it's like we have to do this

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.640
because we've always done it.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:25.760
Yes.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.440
Right.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.680
Which is wrong.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.040
One of the software's, uh, wonderful tautologies.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.440
So what makes this whole thing more interesting,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.400
rewinding the stack is someone on our Slack channel group, which you can go to

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.640
modern testing.org and find the link.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.880
It works for at least 25 more days.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.000
Cause I just updated it.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.130
And thank you to those who remind me when it's, I don't know why my reminders

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.010
aren't working, but remind me to update the link from Slack, et cetera.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:58.500
So someone posted a link from the U S Bureau of labor statistics, which I found

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:05.380
fascinating and contrary to something you Brent said five minutes ago, where you said

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.900
that eventually software testing will be at a point where there's so few, we can

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:15.700
consider it dead, what they're showing with what the U S Bureau of labor

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:21.900
statistics shows is that software testing as an occupation, as a dedicated

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:28.420
occupation will grow by 25% between 2021 and 2031.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.720
Okay.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.360
Now what's missing from that is software development overall growing by, you know,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.040
a hundred percent and it's growing by 25% or is, uh, you know, I don't have that,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.160
the full context of that number, but what this says is we're going to have

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.350
another 400,000 testers in the U S that we have right now in 10 years.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:58.930
Um, will we see, I think that the thing that's interesting is the prevailing

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:04.410
assumption in, and this is, this is the thing I guess I would question is that

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.810
when, when that article tracks that trend, right.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:16.050
To what degree are these testers actually doing the work that, uh, we are

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.240
accustomed to them doing, right?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:25.320
Um, it's like, even the article you sent, uh, talks about, right.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.280
We're going to be less software testers and more quality engineers.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.240
Actually, I'm going to backtrack this whole thing.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.480
I'm going to leave this part in the podcast, but I just looked closer here.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:42.300
And nevermind as Rose, as Roseanne, Rosanna, Dan may have said at one point,

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:48.820
the article actually shows the page is actually showing statistics for,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.820
they've grouped software developers, quality assurance analysts and testers

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.820
into one group, saying that entire group's growing 25%.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.140
So maybe, maybe it's wrong.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.500
I don't, we don't, I don't have the breakdown to get it right.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:03.890
Got it.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.490
So we'll continue looking at this data.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.210
I think it's interesting.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.810
I think if you look at the industry, you know, maybe it's, I don't know,

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.650
I don't know what to think here, but worth looking at,

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.130
look worth doing research.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:21.090
Again, I don't think testing is going away immediately.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.050
I don't think any organization should fire their testers because they've

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.410
heard that not having testers makes you faster.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:34.260
And I know you don't believe that for it either, but we do believe that as

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.780
teams get better at delivery, that the need for that dedicated testing

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.380
specialist, uh, decreases and in some cases it is not needed.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.840
And that's something that was saying forever, no new information.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.160
Let's go on.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.120
Okay.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.600
Fair enough.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.200
Yeah.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.520
Fair enough.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.440
All right.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.040
Anything else to add on that, Brent?

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:53.760
Yeah.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.520
Let's just look at the article, right?

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.080
And just to go through it quickly, they're saying recording playback,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.160
DevOps and agile development.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:04.680
Wait.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:12.320
Uh, the one important thing I think that is missing from here is fast feedback loops.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.600
They talk about agile developments, but they're specifically talking about

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.200
testing early and often making it something continuous or discrete, right?

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.950
But the thing is the real secret about agile development is adaptability.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.830
You don't waste your time on things that don't matter.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:36.110
Like there's, there's, there is one exercise I just did recently with,

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:42.270
with my own team where, uh, we're building a whole new product and I put

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:48.590
them in a room, created a basically very much, um, Eric Ries style, right?

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.750
We, we designed an MVP.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.310
We created, uh, we identified early adopters, started putting them in a

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.350
room and getting their feedback.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:05.590
And now I just sit back and, and my team doesn't argue with me anymore around,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.750
Oh, we got to do this.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.230
Right.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.830
Because they're hearing it from the customer directly.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:16.470
As we've, as we've set in the, in the MTP principles, the customer is the only one

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:21.270
qualified and I can see it from my own team's behavior that they realize that

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.750
cause everything else has been theory.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.750
Let's, let's drill in on that a bit.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:25.310
Sure.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:31.150
I have been, I have kept my Eric Ries book on my desk a lot recently because

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.350
I've been quoting it a lot and holding it up and showing pictures of it.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:41.150
I hate even talking about agile as a thing because it's just been so bastardized

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.940
and, and screwed up, but it's hard.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:49.020
I want to talk about fast feedback loops and being adaptive being lean and

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.460
being lean and learning and being the, the value of the engineering

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:58.800
effort being in learning and having some discussions around, you know, what

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:06.160
that means there is some fear sometimes to deliver something that is not perfect.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.160
And then I just happened to read an article today.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.080
I didn't link to it anywhere, but it talked about perfect being, didn't say

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.100
perfect being the enemy of good, but you're never going to be perfect

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.360
release now and learn.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:24.010
And someone said to me, which is, well, I'll tell you what I said in a second.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:30.880
But I talk, I was talking about doing a release with just to a couple teams.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.720
Didn't have a lot of oomph, but would generate a lot of organizational

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.680
learning via the onboarding process via via a whole bunch of things.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.730
And the comment I heard in a discussion was you only get one chance

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.270
to make a good first impression.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.910
And I'm curious, I'll tell you what I said in a second.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.790
While I agree with the statement in its original context, I do not

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.430
think it applies to software.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.280
Oh, no.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.280
Uh, okay.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.800
Is it my turn to do to reply?

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.200
Go ahead, Brett.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:05.960
Yeah.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.040
So yeah, you're right.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.800
You only get a good, you only get one chance to make a good first impression.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.240
Okay.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.490
But my counter would be, all right.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.640
Uh, what's your evidence that the second impression isn't good enough or

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.880
the third or the fourth or the fifth.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.760
When, when I see that, right.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.440
I remember back in the day and I pretty certain I've talked about this.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.480
When, when Google's first came out and was before I went to Bing, right.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.680
People were like, ah, Google's getting into the OS.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.160
Like what a bunch of idiots.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:50.520
Like we have 40 quadrillion lines of code and you know, uh, we have more

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.960
man hours baked into windows and T that have ever existed in the planet history.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:57.720
Right.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.080
They were just saying like, that's an impossible task.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.520
Why would, why would Google do that?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.760
And I remember my manager specifically talking about the search engine and

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.360
they're like, it's buggy AF.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.030
Why the quality is just awful.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.070
People are going to abandon it.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:20.230
And I remember talking to him and I'm like, yeah, you're full of crap, dude.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.030
You do not understand what you're talking about.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.230
Cause if that were true, the stock price would be tanking.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:32.390
And what ended up happening is Google, uh, because they were, did a very good

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.830
job on their telemetry, they've did a very good job on fast feedback, the

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:43.000
experience that customers had the first time through, yeah, it was buggy.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.080
But you know what?

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.600
The second time through, all of those bugs were gone.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.880
And the second time through a lot harder to find a new bug.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.320
And that second time through was not that long after the first time through.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.120
It wasn't, it was just like two weeks later.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.600
And so what ended up happening is those customers did not walk away with a

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.480
view of this product, this shit.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.110
They walked away with a view.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:14.620
The quality is visibly improving in front of their eyes, right?

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.740
They walked away with a net positive, not a net negative, but the secret

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.300
is the fast feedback loop.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:21.780
Yes.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.100
If the bug stays there for three years.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:25.940
Yeah.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.720
And even the bug, it's like, this would be great if you could do X.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.480
Yeah.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.640
And then all of a sudden it does X in a week and then it does right.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.440
Some Y and two weeks and X and Y and Z in three weeks.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.800
Like, Oh my God, this just gets better and better.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.120
I want to keep going back and using this.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.200
It is so hard from my experience.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.000
I have not yet, maybe you have.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.090
I have not yet found a way to convince people that, that what they are

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:01.650
proposing is significantly more risky than what I am proposing, but it's

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:07.690
really hard to convince them of that without them experiencing it from my ex from.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:08.610
Right.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.730
I could send them to Ryan, uh, Ryan Irnsons book, right?

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.130
But even then it's, it's so challenging to battle.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.850
Well, yeah, that's a great thing, but it's all theoretically, or, you know,

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.970
my products, the snowflake or, or those types of things.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.090
Those arguments are difficult to push back on.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.850
Yeah.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:32.690
So when I heard someone say you only get in regarding a software release, you

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:37.570
only get one chance to make a first impression, my immediate answer is that

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:43.990
phrase can go, I agree with the sentiment reps, not it's okay.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:48.710
It was a conversation with someone, uh, who took it.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.550
They didn't, they weren't offended.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.950
Ah, got it.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.910
The, the, the, the answer was something like done that phrase as

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.070
and then we had a discussion around why.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:03.190
So there is, and this is really a learning.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.190
This is a gap like in crossing the chasm sort of gap or a learning curve.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.550
You see the same thing come up and people argue against us when we say

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.430
only the customer can evaluate quality.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:21.290
It is difficult if you haven't done it yet to make the jump from we

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.730
got to get this right to we got to learn as fast as we can.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.410
We got to have that fast feedback loop.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:31.250
It's a jump teams have to make like we have to get this as they

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.170
can think back in the old days.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.570
We would test the crap.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.050
We would do the bug count coming in as less.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:36.530
Okay.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.610
We can ship shipping that way now is irresponsible.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:45.770
And, but it takes like, look at the argument we get against that.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.290
Like it's important for me as the tester to evaluate product risk

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.610
for my stakeholders and make sure I'm making the best.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:56.970
They will do a crap ton of work and the customers will get a product.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.170
And as Eric Reese would say, and I don't know if I'm a disciple, a

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.210
follower or a fan or a reader or a believer in Eric Reese, but what

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:10.330
he would say, he would say, should, and he has said, show me

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:14.650
a product with no bugs and I'll show you a product that shipped too late.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:15.610
Yes.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.850
Or still hasn't shipped.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.130
No.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.450
So it's a jump to make, right?

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.330
You go from, okay, I, this has to be, I have to do, I have to do all this

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.970
work to make sure I do my due diligence to, we have the ability to, if

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.770
we, if something's wrong, I can change it in 10 minutes in a, in an hour.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:39.760
Versus and just making that jump and being able to say the focus is on fixing

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.380
forward versus fixing ahead.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.500
That's a big jump that a lot of teams need to make.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:52.300
I think it's probably the most, maybe one of the most difficult jumps to make in,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.980
I hate to use the word agile in adaptive delivery.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.940
I'm going to call adaptive delivery with the capital A and probably also the one

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.340
blocking the most teams and the one that gives teams the most benefit.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.740
When you learn as a software organization to deliver, we do, man.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:16.250
When you learn as a software organization to deliver with fast feedback loops and

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.170
count on fast feedback loops and rely and use those as part of the way you deliver.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.960
That's a big, that's a, that's a jump.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.280
That's a, that's a lock step jump in your maturity and your capability and your quality.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.160
Okay.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.960
Given that you just said that hold on to hold on to that thought because a well

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:43.960
known living expert in testing, uh, did a comment in that same thread.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.960
I wish to share that comment.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.120
Testing is not quality engineering, right?

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.200
Again, this is a well-known testing expert.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:52.960
Okay.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.520
True.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:00.280
Testing is learning about the product so that the people designing, developing,

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:07.640
and managing it can decide whether the product they've got is the product they want.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:08.800
Okay.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.200
Yeah.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.960
I just hate that because I don't, I don't want to go into.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.800
I want you to remember what you just said about Eric Reese.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.080
My point isn't around where you and I agree on tests as the

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.000
people who provide information.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.440
Yeah.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:27.680
Right.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.400
You and I agree that that's bullshit.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.160
That's total crap.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:41.560
But this well-known testing expert is claiming that testing is learning about the product so that people, the people designing it, developing and

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:47.360
management, managing it can, can decide whether the product they got is the product they want.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:47.960
Okay.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:48.520
Okay.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:59.360
Given what you said about Eric Reese and in my view, the testing experts own definition of testing is testing jobs going away.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.860
God, I sure as hell hope so.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.940
Well, no, they should be the proper kind of testing.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.260
They should be modern testing.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.380
They should be experimentation testing.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:15.340
The way you do what that person described is analytics, data analysis, fast feedback loops.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:22.060
You don't do it by holding onto the product and, and, and making sure it gets your once over for your stakeholders to make the

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.540
decision on whether it releases or not.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.460
But my, my,

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:35.340
apply what he said to the actual real type of testing as tests, real testing from an experimentation and metrics point of view.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.180
And I actually think it's kind of accurate.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.140
I don't know.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:38.860
Okay.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.460
It's so depends on how you stretch it.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:48.380
That cause my view, my view is the Eric Reese model, right?

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:55.540
That migrates over to the, to the product manager's job or, or it's a portion of the developer's job.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:56.660
Sure.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:05.580
It's like having it, having an in-house person who, who again is not the customer.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:14.620
It's the ad, not even the champion of the customer as, as your, um, meamish slide details.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:20.300
It, I'm like, why would I ever hire such a person described on that one?

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:29.700
I would rather have my people have direct connection with the customer and not have some, some in between like the product.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.860
The product I want is not the one on paper.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.820
The product I want is the one that actually adds a value stream that I can make a stable business plan off of.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.780
It's it, that is an anti-modern testing comment.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.260
Unless you squint and stretch it to be, uh, testing as experimentation.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:54.130
And then of course, this, um, because only the customer can tell you if it's the product they want your stakeholders can't.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.320
Right.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:07.440
And, and certainly having, having someone in house and unless they're the ones going out and talking to, to the customer, they're not going to be able to do that.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.960
But I'm going to tell you that job has traditionally been viewed as marketing, not testing.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.120
So, so this is the same thing.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.720
And again, this is, and sorry, and listeners actually not sorry, but this is where we're at.

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.760
This is a conversation we've had the people who want to be doing the testing like Brent and I used to do in the nineties.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.680
Want, they don't want to do anything different.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.160
They want to test like it's 1997 and that's fine.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.360
They're very good testers for 1997.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:48.240
The world needed those in 1997 software, most software, much software is delivered differently today and no longer benefits from that kind of tester.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.120
Yes.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:49.960
Yes.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.240
I mean, we're not here.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.840
Well, as we've said many times before, we're not here to kill testing.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.080
We're basically saying the motor, like that's the way the wind's blowing.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:11.160
What's rough here is that Brent and I getting going back to Myers Briggs part horoscope part science, mostly horoscope, but INTPs we hate inefficiency.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.640
And when we see that we see this again, fast feedback loops.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.160
We love them because they're super efficient.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.000
When we see little blockers come into that feedback loop, why am I waiting for this?

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.480
We get really, really mad.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:22.640
Yes.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.400
No need for it.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.200
What the hell are we waiting on?

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:38.840
I told, I have told my team, done is my second favorite four letter word and wait is absolutely my least favorite four letter word.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:39.800
I like that.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.520
I like that.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:51.040
We weaved around that and got some good segues back and forth, repeated a lot of the stuff, but honestly, it's good stuff to repeat.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.400
You know, every podcast isn't about the same stuff.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:36:03.580
We talk about stuff differently, hoping that some of this will stick for those that maybe haven't got it yet.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.860
At least one person someday.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.620
One person someday.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:07.860
Yeah.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.220
I, it's tough.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:14.300
We're not, we're just trying to tell stories and get people to understand why we think the way we do.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.900
And here we are.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.780
Testing is maybe a dying profession.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.540
Maybe not.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.580
We may never know.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:31.610
There may be testers, like as you called out in 25% growth in tech field, there was right.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:35.890
The AI bit is interesting.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.770
Well, if I could hypothesize on growth in general, and again, the, the paper was everyone.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.730
I think tech is going to grow quickly.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:50.170
I think, you know, that original statistical study was 21.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:54.930
We're seeing generative AI become a very interesting thing.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.250
Interesting thing to many companies.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:07.730
We are, I think there's, like I've said before, we are on the edge of some significant advances in software.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.170
I'm not going to give away spoilers.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:13.890
I listened to an, listen to the audio book of The Origin on my hike a few weeks ago.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.210
And there's an AI in that book and it's, I'm not going to give away anything.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.330
The book is the audio book.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.530
The book is not great, but fun, but there's an AI in there.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.290
It makes you think about things AIs could do.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:30.810
And then I watched the Mission Impossible movie, which has an AI in it last night.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.890
And it's, it's funny.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:39.600
I think we're going to look back in 10 years and look at what AI actually is then.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:45.160
And just laugh at what fiction made it out to be here in 2023.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.760
That'll be interesting.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.000
But like I said, AI isn't taking jobs away.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.840
So people that use AIR, I think it's going to be a lot of people.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:05.120
Please don't call them prompt engineers, but there's a lot of people building generative AI models to help solve significant customer problems or new problems we haven't thought about.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.150
But maybe with fewer engineers than we would today.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.630
So it's, I think there's a shift.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:21.910
Not only is there a growth of tech, but there's a shift in what people are doing in order to deliver value that solves customer problems in the next 10 years.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.050
I don't know.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:29.210
10 years ago, we could not have imagined what's going on now, nor will.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:34.410
So these, these predictions on growth are, they're, they're our best guess.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:39.250
I do predict right now that there will be churn in the industry.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.290
You know what?

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:47.370
I'm, I'm slightly less pessimistic on this than I was a little while ago.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:59.730
Like, um, my team, we are a few weeks away from shipping our first actual, uh, in the end product that is heavily reliant on LOM.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.640
And, and I will tell you, like there's language I shared a little while ago, right?

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.840
That LLM is kind of a schizophrenic.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.800
It's some part, it's a genie one part, it's a parrot and another part is an SME.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:22.320
And so now there's like, so even language, like I would call up when my ICs and I'm like, Oh my God, the genie is pissing me off.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.640
It's, it's like you, you add.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.360
I changed the sentence from is something, something to our something, something, right?

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:38.640
It was grammatically incorrect, but just that one tense change completely changed the output.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.880
It's fascinating, but I will absolutely agree.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:51.760
Those who don't join or understand this, this, this change and have, have the ability to quickly learn.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.200
If they get behind, I don't see how they will ever catch up.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.310
I see the way the industry is going forward.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:16.950
The people who are, I think the next most at risk of being laid off are those who have not figured out how to learn and execute off of those learnings quickly.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:18.230
Absolutely.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:31.150
And one thing I talk about a lot, even in, I talk about a lot, I won't give examples is the need to be a generalist in software is just becoming more and more important.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:36.390
I've been talking to a lot of new and career are about to be new and career folks.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:43.630
And I bring up the fact that I spent the first five, seven, eight years of my career writing in C only.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.980
Just wrote C code and eventually added some assembly.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:59.700
That was about it for the first, you know, seven years of my career, maybe more today, working on software today, writing in one language all day, probably getting rare.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:14.190
And then in addition to that, you're not just writing code, you're gluing technologies together, your, your configuring web services and, and, you know, yaml and gluing this to that and doing an API here to

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.110
compress this to there.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.790
It's changing.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:31.380
And I think with generative AI and, you know, who knows what other tools coming on that the ability to be able to do a bunch of different things comfortably is going to be a key in being successful in the long term.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.300
Yeah.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:33.600
Agree.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.400
You're making a face.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.040
I know that maybe I'm, maybe I'm way wrong.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.120
No, you're, you're, you are totally correct.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:40.560
Cool, man.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.180
Well, let's do the mailbag next time.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.720
If we get it, unless something else comes up.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.720
I don't know, but I think, uh, we talked a lot about it.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.720
Lots to think about.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.720
I think we talked about some old stuff and got some new ideas in there.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.920
Uh, we'll see how good it ends up when I finished editing, but probably pretty good.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.080
Probably this is the bed best podcast from AB testing.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.440
You listened to, um, one of the best AB testing podcasts of today.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.360
Right.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:12.720
If let me do, actually we just, we have it just a few more minutes.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.040
bonus material.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.600
I'm trying to find the article.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.280
I lost it.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:24.680
One more thing that the test expert mentioned.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.680
I would question if test experts, something that someone has a title, someone

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.320
assigns to themselves, something that's assigned by a community or like, where

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.440
does, how does one become a test expert?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.360
Well, in this particular case, I'm, I'm leveraging the fact that by the, by the,

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:53.710
the people who invoke quotes of the test expert, I'm a short answer.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.510
Community is, is the one I'm using.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.030
Sure.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.070
Feed me the quote.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.140
All right.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.740
So they quoted something from the article.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:09.780
Quality engineers will need to ensure business factor quality into every aspect

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:14.580
of the SDLC and increasingly the value stream management process.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:20.760
And the expert came back with three substances.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:23.490
That's not what testers do.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.650
That's what management does.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.070
Testing is not a dying profession.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:30.290
Okay.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.450
Again, straw, man's against straw, man's.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:33.290
It's fine.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.010
I'm just like, okay.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:41.440
If testing isn't going to care about the, the, the value stream management or the

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.720
impact of the business, right.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:50.000
Principle number one and, and testing's job is essentially to be the internal

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.040
expert that the team has gotten the product they want it honestly, I don't

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.920
see how, how they can conclude test is not a dying profession.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.490
Well, right.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:09.210
Because there are so matter, so many better ways in today's world to achieve those goals.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:13.650
Well, this is the thing that, and again, we're going to end here, but this is what

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.770
bugs me the most about some of the experts is they pride themselves on

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:23.570
critical thinking, yet they can't take a step back and say, what are some ways

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.290
which this may or may not be true?

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:30.410
What are some, is this, is this thing I'm talking about is the execution

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.970
of this, the only way this statement can be true.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.410
And that's the statement that's being made here.

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:39.890
And you and I are saying, Hey, there are other ways that may be more efficient.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.240
And that comes up a lot when we talk about these things, they say, nope,

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240
that won't work for me.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.280
And I, like when I say teams are shipping software without writing UI tests or

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.480
teams are shipping software without having dedicated testers, they go, nope,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.400
that won't work.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.440
I take a step back.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.880
Look, teams are doing this.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.560
Can you imagine a scenario?

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.200
This is true because it is.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.280
So check your bias, check your teals digging in.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.680
Think about a scenario.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.600
This could be true and apply some fricking critical thinking and figure out

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.320
if you need to adjust the way you're thinking, can you, what they're really

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:21.840
saying in my context, which I refuse to change any views on this statement

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.720
is true or false, right?

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.280
This is from people who say they, they're driven by context and

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.040
they're critical thinkers, but they're not applying those things when talking

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:36.200
about subjects like this, because if this were true, if software testing

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.800
was a dying profession, and this is the end, it's one, it's worse.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.680
Like it's bad.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.640
If you are, if you think the only thing you could ever do is software testing,

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.080
you see this article, you go, well, that can't be true.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.480
And I refuse to believe it because my livelihood is on this.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.840
And now think you're in a position where you're an expert and your

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.320
livelihood is based on people being in this profession that cannot die.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.160
Otherwise you don't, you can't make any money because you refuse to do anything

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.000
else, of course you're going to dig your heels in, of course you're not

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.960
going to use a critical thinking.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.720
Of course you're not going to apply any context or perspective.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.120
Well, it was a Mark Twain quote, I forget it.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.120
It was something around a man's opinion.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.560
Uh, it's more wittier than what I'm doing, but a man's opinion is directly

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.040
related to their incentive, right?

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.040
It's essentially something new comes out.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:35.120
Their opinion of that new thing is going to be directly related to how well that

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.680
enables them to continue to do their job.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.080
Right.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.360
That was, that was delirally quoted.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.840
But I would say, you know, behavior, my quote is, uh, behavior comes from motivation.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.000
I was going to work with that motivation.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.920
This one, it's crystal clear what that is.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.720
I don't know the Mark Twain quilt, but one of our listeners can find it

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.280
and post it on our Slack group.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.280
Yes.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:57.800
All right.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:58.560
Okay.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.080
That has been episode 184.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.840
Believe it or not.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.840
The countdown to 200 continues.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.710
I'm Mr.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:07.070
Weasel.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.860
And I am.
