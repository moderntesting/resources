WEBVTT

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.320
Hey Brent, are you ready?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm ready, Alan.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320
Let's go.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320
Alright, we're back.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.320
Nineteen.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.320
Episode 19.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.520
We are so prepared.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.520
This is the A.B.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.720
Testing Podcast, and I'm Alan.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.720
I'm Brent.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.160
And now we can have our talk.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.200
Wow, we started the ADT thing even before the podcast this time.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.810
Well, yes.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.810
New record.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.150
Hey, speaking of ADT, hasn't it been like almost exactly a year since our first podcast?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.150
Almost exactly.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.830
We have like two weeks.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.750
So oh, okay, not yet.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690
So no cake today.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.790
Don't send a cake care of Alan Page through the OA Microsoft Redmond Washington.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.790
Right.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.870
Don't do that.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.350
But instead send the Don Perrion to Brent J. Microsoft Redmond Washington.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.350
Or Don Julio.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.940
Actually, yeah, both will work.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.180
We will do, how about 8 a.m. tequila shots on our anniversary?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.180
Why not?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.180
Why not?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.180
We'll do.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.340
We'll do.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.300
I know we'll do every time we go off on a tangent.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.460
We'll do a shot.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.980
We have a whole 45 minutes to fill.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.620
I'm not certain that we'll do it.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.830
Hey, because of our anniversary, I got to be a little serious here for a second, Brent.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.630
Are we going to turn on the mood music?

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.630
Well, no.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.270
I believe in sharing everything.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.380
And I want you to know that I stepped out on you, man.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.380
That's okay.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.980
I've been doing the same for you for years.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.090
Well, I did.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.440
I recorded another podcast with someone else.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.470
Cool.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.150
I know you want me to be all.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.150
What?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.150
What the hell?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.150
What did you do?

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.100
Don't you value our podcasting?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.780
So what was it all about?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.580
Joe Colantoneo has his testing podcast.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.940
Had it going on for quite a while.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.100
He has more episodes than us, so I got to give him some credit.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.140
His podcasts, I haven't listened to all of them, but they're mostly interviews.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.500
He decided to interview me a week or two weeks ago.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.930
We talked a lot about test automation.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.930
I just talked.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.850
He thought there were some good nuggets in there, but I just blabbed about a lot of stuff

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.740
we've talked about here and in the A word, my Lean Pub book, which is closing in on 1,000

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.660
downloads and very happy.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.500
I'll put a link to it in our show notes.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.980
You can't get enough of me.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.980
Imagine that.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.420
People are going, no way am I listening to his voice any more than I am now.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.780
But if you're if you have maybe, I don't know, maybe my family or something, maybe

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.860
can anyway, long lost cousins, friends on Facebook.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.980
I guess so.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.980
I guess so.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.380
Anyway, that bully from high school.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.460
But I my thoughts on software testing are yet in another blog.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.120
So was it just general, high level?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.120
No, no, no.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120
We talked about.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.480
People should test things.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.880
You know, do you want me to just take the rest of the podcast and just repeat it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.480
word for word?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.040
No, I want you to do like the top three bullets.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.480
We talked a little bit about like as a teaser.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.920
We talked about false positives and how people don't take them seriously.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.990
We talked about we spent an entire episode on that once.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.630
Yeah.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.740
Just some things to do with test automation.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.820
We talked about GUI automation and how I think it's mostly dumb.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.710
I'm sorry, mostly dumb is the wrong word, mostly ill advised and not worth the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.390
effort, but how to make kind of make it worth the effort if possible.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.110
And talk about model view controller, etc.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.750
Some things like that.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.350
Just, you know, stuff I've learned or made up or copied over my vast career in

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.910
software.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.830
Yes.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.710
Hey, do you, since we're doing promo, did you want to do another star

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.000
Canada that's coming up, right?

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.980
Yeah, I got my, my mail saying turn in your slides by May something and,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.140
and etc.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.510
Yesterday, but which I, I, this year I was so on the ball.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.870
I started making up my outline and putting together slides like a month ago.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.550
And then I did it for like a day and then I stopped.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.310
So I still have all the work to do.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.550
It's in my head.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.670
I know what I want to do in my head, but I got to kind of put it all together.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.180
And then I do this really crummy thing where I don't like it.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.060
That conference is what my slides, uh, a month in advance, because I don't

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.800
really have it nailed down till like an hour before I do my, does that have to

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.480
be final slides or the same thing?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.480
You know, I'm not a tweak them.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.600
No, I always have to send a update because they never match what's in the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.360
book that they publish.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.480
Uh, I think that's fairly common.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.020
I get it kind of close, but there is a lot of editing that goes on.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.180
What I submit to the star folks is this is absolutely what I'm going to cover.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.600
Not necessarily how I'm going to cover it or the order I'm going to cover it,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.080
but this is the story I'm going to tell.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.200
So there's value in the slides.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.590
It's not like there's, if you just heard me talk and didn't look at the pretty

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.510
pictures behind me, you probably get, uh, you wouldn't know the slides were

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.550
different, but some people can get really, um,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.910
sounds like they, they want the month so that they can do some logistics,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.870
like printing out crap.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.150
Right.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.430
Right.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.590
And absolutely, that absolutely didn't need that.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.710
So it's a, it works out.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.270
I think it's okay.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.320
They've never had them complain about me missing, uh, my slides not matching.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.760
So it's okay.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.840
Just kind of the way I do things.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.600
Uh, I do want to get it started though, before, uh, work gets a little bit more

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.600
hectic, but anyway, it's only five weeks away.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.120
Our Canada third week in June, I'm doing a tutorial and a keynote and, uh,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.080
lightning talk keynote, uh, all packed in there.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.200
I'm doing like the, um, I think my tutorial is Monday or Tuesday.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.360
I think it's Monday.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.440
My keynote is the next morning.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.920
And then I'm doing a five minute lightning talk as part of lightning

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.120
structure, keynotes that afternoon.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.920
So lots of Allen.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.160
And then I disappear.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.980
We should, we talked about this last time.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.700
We should talk about whether or not we want to do a, uh, an AB up there.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.020
We kind of talked about it.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.100
And then, uh, if you're there, are you going to go?

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.380
If we're going to do an AB, yeah, I'll be there.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.470
All right.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.290
What were we talking about?

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.970
Should we get to our agenda?

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.570
I don't even have my, um, glasses on passport.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.760
So I'm like, if I'm going to go to the Canada, it's going to be worth my while.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.600
All right.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.860
What's topic number two, Alan?

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.230
Uh, what do you say?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.790
Oh, on the board.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.030
Yes.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.430
Yes.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.430
What?

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.310
So, uh, believe it or not, I sent mail to Brent.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.150
Yes.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.270
This week with a question, I'll send it to Ken Johnston.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.830
People are going, who is Ken Johnston?

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.750
Ken Johnston wrote, uh, a couple of chapters of how we test software

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.550
at Microsoft and he's, uh, we still cross paths quite a bit.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.390
Yeah.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.890
He's also a very big, uh, uh, presenter around the world.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.130
Not quite as, I don't think he does it as much as Alan does, but

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.570
he goes around the world for whatever that means he's, he's a, he's a blogger.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.130
And, uh, he knows a lot.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.330
He has a, I think he's, uh, uh, uh, there's so many tangents.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.570
I want to go out of my head right now.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.810
He's a former manager of mine.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.970
Is he of yours as well for a manager of mine?

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.290
I don't know.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.010
You worked for him.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.330
Yeah.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.290
That's funny.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.290
Uh, you know, a great mind on, uh, sort of the data world testing and production,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.490
data, different quality, et cetera.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.470
Anyway, my question was mail bag.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.270
No, it doesn't count.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.430
Uh, so I'm looking at, and I hate the word dashboard.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.430
I called it dashboard in the mail and I think it set off some weird connotations,

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.230
but so we'll call it scorecard.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:15.670
So I'm looking at some crap on a webpage that represents, uh, our

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.150
product usage through data, which scenarios have been covered, whether

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.390
errors we've seen, whether a scenario is completed successfully.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.670
It's a nice view looking, it tells, looks in across our product.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.830
It shows what people are doing and where they're running into problems.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.350
It's a nice view into the product.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:33.910
Okay.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.350
And I'm looking at it.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.970
I'm thinking this is really cool, but there's so much of

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.450
the story that's not being told.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.400
So the question I had for Brett and Ken, I'll call, I'll call

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.600
Bren or Ken Brent.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:48.880
I don't know.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.960
I'll think I need a name for you.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.320
Kind of like, uh, I don't know some hybrid name team awesome.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:54.680
Yeah.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.560
Um, let me thank no.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.070
So my question to them was somewhere along the lines of this, look,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.350
I have this data, give us a lot of information.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.950
I'm realizing more and more that it doesn't give me all the information I need.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.190
And there's some things we're not going to get through, uh, product

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.030
telemetry and metrics, uh, measurements.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.350
Um, I don't know.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.350
There's a lot of things about risk.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.830
I don't know.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.700
We're still, we find a lot of bugs internally and we have, which aren't

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.190
represented there, there could be bugs that we know need to be fixed.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.550
The customers aren't running into could be, um, some of us just out, you

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.450
know, looking at outstanding work items for a particular area, uh, looking

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.410
at other risk measures like, uh, scenario coverage or people are, are we

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.850
getting people are completing these scenarios that we have measurements for,

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:51.370
but are they, do we have the full coverage, not code coverage, but full.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.850
Do we feel like people have done this scenario enough and enough and then

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.410
the permutations we care about it.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.890
There's four different ways to do something.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.790
Have they done it all for the telemetry that you're looking at is, is it

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.770
represent sort of telemetry from some form of testing and production?

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.490
So, well, we are so we're so private and small right now that our

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.650
only users is our internal team right now.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.730
Okay.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.290
But at, but we're getting very close to going to a much wider audience.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.410
And my worry is when we get there, we're going to get a bunch more data.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:29.790
And I don't know whether that, when we look at that data and aggregates

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:37.720
from a larger number of people, will we will that data on that web page give

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.700
me a good representation of how our product's doing and how, you know,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.760
any risks we have about shipping, et cetera.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.000
I feel like there's a lot more information I want to see as part of that.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.720
And I can't decide whether it's two different reports, whether I find

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.600
a way to merge that in there or what.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.280
So having been in, you've been in services a lot longer than I have

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.120
and Ken as well, my question was, do you, when you're looking at services

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.480
that you're doing testing and production or data driven quality on, what

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.640
sort of data do you look at that's not customer data and how do you

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.360
incorporate that into the views into product risk and quality?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.200
Can I take this a different way?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.880
Absolutely.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.000
Until I say no.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.480
Okay.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.160
Fair enough.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:34.420
Because the way you describe dashboards seems relatively common.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:35.800
Right.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:47.160
The issue is what's not clear is you're doing a dashboard that produces

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.400
information.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.320
I got to tell you every time you say dashboard, it's like, not the right

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.280
word, but go on the chart.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.440
Anyway, go on.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.720
So once you go to, there's a term that I'm fond of.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.000
It's not mine.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.760
I wish it were.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.200
A guy described most dashboards.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:14.960
He's a vocal leader, I would say most likely on your side of the point of

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.080
view, but what he describes is that most dashboards are just a bunch of data

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.400
puke.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.240
Yeah.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:23.600
Right.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.800
A phrase I use quite often.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.960
I love data puke.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.650
Is data rich, data rich information or insight poor?

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.330
You know what you, I'm going to interrupt for just a second, let you go on,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.650
because that kind of hits on it.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:44.890
I feel like the information on our current air quote dashboard is valuable,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.650
but I want to see more without puking on it.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.040
The primary issue is when people put together dashboards, it's very easy to

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.780
sort of barf a lot of numbers into a website.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.100
Yeah.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.380
Huh?

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.740
But they got the cart before the horse.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.820
So when you, when you go into the very basic thing on, on business

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.380
intelligence, data turns into information.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.740
Information turns into knowledge.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.660
Do you know the difference between information and knowledge?

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.290
Yes, I do.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.290
What is it?

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:21.810
I'm out.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.050
I'm going to let you go on and tell me.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.410
All right.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.850
Uh, hopefully I'll pass my own test.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.330
My, my quick answer is, is I'm going to take, I thought where you were going

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.650
is I'm going to take action on the knowledge.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.370
I can't really take action on the information until I process it into

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.530
something that I could do something with.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.730
Knowledge is actionable information.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.250
It's, uh, hell yeah.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.130
I know, I know.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.650
Crap.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.250
The difference between street smart and book smart.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.660
Book smart people are dumb.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.870
Maybe that was a little bit too general.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.230
I don't know.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.470
Book smart people, they know a lot of stuff, but they can't use any of it.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.390
Street starts people know very little stuff, but they can use

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:02.470
everything that they got.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.190
We could do a whole fricking podcast on this.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:11.150
Easily the, but knowledge is useless without action.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:19.590
So yeah, you have a bunch of stuff that you can take action on, but the whole

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.310
point of these things is to be able to decide what action to take.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:30.320
So the biggest problem with a lot of these dashboards is they're, they're

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.960
putting together a bunch of data.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.400
Actually it's more information than data, but putting together a bunch of

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.760
information and not very clear around upfront, what sorts of actions

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.480
people want to be able to take.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.040
Um, and then, you know, the term, uh, actionable versus vanity metrics,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.200
much of these dashboards are nothing but vanity metrics that, that really

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.160
is there's a hope theory behind it that says, Hey, I hope one day that if I get

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.400
enough information on this board, somebody smarter than me will be able to

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.880
triangulate on something actionable.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.120
Yeah.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.320
Yeah.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.200
Where does the line come?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.520
Cause I've had this argument about vanity metrics before.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:16.190
Where does the line come between a vanity metric and, uh, often it's

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.270
terrific or I'm going here.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.350
Someone wants to take what I think is clearly a vanity metric and

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.990
tell me it's something it isn't.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.190
For example, okay.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.550
Test pass rate.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.670
Uh, test pass.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.270
How about, how about number of tests run?

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.710
We ran 2 million tests.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.950
Fantastic.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:39.110
So what they want to convey with that is we have great product coverage

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.110
cause we ran 2 million.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.510
How, how expensive we are.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.120
But absolutely anyway, means nothing.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.830
I don't care whether you've ran one test or 10 million tests.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.350
It's not, it doesn't matter to me.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.470
I, so I'll take a more practical point of view than that.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.030
Oh fine.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.590
Be practical.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.950
Right.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:08.050
Um, the fact that they ran 2 million tests, uh, likely means something, but

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.330
they're not making it clear what it means.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.720
Right.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.170
I find the odds of someone running 2 million tests and that, that isn't

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:23.690
something useful, very low, but exactly how useful and what's missing

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.850
is completely unclear.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.090
There's no knowledge there.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:26.890
Right.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:27.970
Absolutely.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:33.170
It's the same thing, uh, with, um, test pass rates.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.240
Hey, a hundred percent test passed.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.910
If I just communicate that, um, you don't know if that's 2 million

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.990
test cases or two.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.320
Same thing if I tell you 50% of our test pass, but only ran two and one

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.150
failed because of a product, but it's also the same if you say, uh,

00:16:53.150 --> 00:17:00.220
Hey, customers are, are hitting, uh, this crash.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.620
This, this is the number one call stack in our service.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.310
Okay.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:12.420
So what just because it's the number one doesn't necessarily the, the,

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.340
the general rule thumb at, Hey, you should fix the number one call stack.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:25.020
But what if the number one call stack is only really impacting say 2% of

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:31.760
your customer base and only for two minutes, maybe it's not worth the

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.080
time to fix that call stack.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.100
Right.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.180
This is how you convert it.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.060
The way I try to take these things is try to convert it into something

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:45.630
that's sort of an ROI, um, or even a risk to return by, by turning it

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.950
into a ratio versus just a bullshit number.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.800
Uh, you, you increase the odds of it being actionable.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.360
Right.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.480
And that's exactly what I'm looking for in this view into our product.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.400
I want actionable data.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.560
And I feel like I have that now, but it's not the complete list of actions.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.240
So it doesn't tell me that I have a whole bunch of bugs to go fix here.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.280
And there's risk inherent in that that's missing from my view.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.460
I, let me, let me get on a soapbox for a second.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.220
Weird never happens a first ever.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.940
One of the ABs is going to get on a soapbox.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.340
Yes.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.660
Oh, the soapbox.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:35.200
This was actually my, my, this is a big part of my last, um, what

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.800
are those things that we write blog posts.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.360
Thank you.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:45.340
In, in Microsoft, there's actually two and beginning to be a third sort of.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:54.330
Train of thought of how to produce, uh, these, these, uh, visualizations or

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:59.040
tools for, for working with that just occurred to me.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.000
Maybe I could be the first to invent the context driven school of data.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:11.760
Um, for those, for those of you not in the room, uh, the look I gave Brent,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.480
I'll just say was interesting.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.600
I didn't tell him he was number one.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.720
No, but I sure felt it.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.480
But I did age him a few years.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.620
So number one, and this is what you just told me is people just make up numbers

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.740
and put it on a website and then pet themselves on the back data puke.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.620
I love that term.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.460
I'm going to use that a lot.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.900
Data puke number two is the GQM crowd.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:36.940
Oh yeah.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:37.620
Okay.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.420
Where you have a goal and you come up with your questions, then you come up

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.860
with the don't measure it.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.500
If you don't know what question you're going to answer.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.300
Yes.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:52.820
Um, I've actually had a chat with one of the, the, the, the people who wrote

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.860
one of the chapters and I'm like, I think it was well suited for.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.740
Through one of the what chapters.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.510
And so there's a, I forget the book.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.840
We know all of the authors for this book, but, um, chapter seven.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.400
Oh yeah.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.880
Yeah.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.280
Okay.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.720
Right.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.560
Chapter seven in this book is all about GQM.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:13.880
Right.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.040
I actually, um, we know all the authors and I got to meet Vic

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.920
Basili, the guy who invented GQM once.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.160
Oh, I, I thought so.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.840
Name drop pal.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.720
Alan wins again.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.900
Boom goes the Alan might the, I actually think they're missing a step.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.300
So I don't think, cause goal is ambiguous.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:44.600
And the way I, I tell people to, to think through it is first come up

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:50.200
with your hypothesis and your hypothesis is a statement, not a question.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.340
It's a statement of belief.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.210
I believe that this scenario will do something.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.270
Okay.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.150
And that something when, when you're doing it at this level, state that

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:08.630
hypothesis in terms of a business KPI that the business values, I believe

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:15.830
this will increase engagement or adoption or, uh, customer acquisition, or it will

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:21.650
push down, um, uh, D sat things along those lines, tie it to something

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.730
that's valuable to the business.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:30.120
And then once you have that hypothesis, enumerate the set of actions that you

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:36.830
would take assuming that that hypothesis were true or that hypothesis turned,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.950
um, proved false.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.790
Okay.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.350
So you, you state a belief.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:45.830
Then after that you go, if I were able to prove this one way or the other, what

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.630
would I do enumerate those actions?

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.630
Once you have those actions, then you go to the questions, but the purpose of the

00:21:53.630 --> 00:22:01.420
questions is to confidently select the correct action.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.880
You now want to ask a set of questions that go, once I had these answers, how

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.880
do I know which of these actions to take?

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:17.130
That is a, uh, it's very similar to GQM, uh, but significant enough in the

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.890
differences, they should probably write that down sometime.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:19.730
Cause it's good.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.890
Yeah.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.810
It's as I just mentioned, it's in my last blog post.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:29.170
So if I'm a step on my soap box for a moment, uh, and we alluded to this.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.850
I have one more thing by the way.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.610
Oh, what?

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.730
Tell you what I will pause my soap box.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.970
So that I can finish your thing.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.370
Let me have closure, Alan.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:36.810
Please.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.410
Oh yeah.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:37.970
Whatever.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:38.410
Go ahead.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:43.420
Then of course, after you have those questions answered or after you have

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:50.390
those questions enumerated, then you go and instrument what you need in order

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:58.120
to answer those questions, this allows you to avoid the, the instrumentation

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.060
bloat that seems to be happening over and over again, because now you know

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.380
exactly what you're trying to prove.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.020
You know, the set of questions.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.500
There you go.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.500
There's room for a little bit more there.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.420
I think the answer is somewhere between only measure what you're only

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.660
measure, what you have a goal or a question for and measuring everything.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.500
The answer is somewhere in between those two.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.700
So that's a good point.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.140
I suggested it allows you to do that.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.520
I don't think that's necessarily a good idea.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.900
Cause even like there's a chance that you're not asking fully the right

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.420
questions, right?

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.260
Because it, the whole, very good chance.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:44.890
The, the whole point to this, there's this awesome data science term

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.410
called uncertainty.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.270
And when you enter into the data science, just a stupid buzzword.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.060
Uh, it certainly has the risk of it.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:03.810
Uh, before, so one of the, where I really fell in love with the term

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.010
uncertainty when I was reading Doug Hubbard's writing on risk and measurement.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.050
Doug is fantastic.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.400
So it's Doug, a data scientist.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.690
I think in today's terms, he'd be, he'd be viewed as that.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.810
I think it's anybody who actually thinks about numbers sensibly is

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.770
now a data scientist.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.160
Anyone who thinks about it and can act on it.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:23.760
Sure.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.040
Anyway, go on, go on.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.520
And then I still have myself box to get up onto the, although I think

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.160
he'd probably call himself an applied statistician.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:31.720
Yeah.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:41.200
Um, which data science now incorporates the, um, you totally got me off on the weeds.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.240
What the hell was I talking about?

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.640
I don't know.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.680
I'm gonna get up on myself.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.520
I don't care.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.800
So talking about GQM remind reminded me of something in general and all,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:57.750
I'll, I'll talk about GQM zealots, uh, and abstractly and, and figure out

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:58.470
where I go from there.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.670
This is not a planned speech.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:05.510
I have no words in front of me, but the people that I know that.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.250
Adore GQM are the ones that say, if you don't have a goal for it, you do not measure it.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.170
There is no, no middle ground.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:21.070
You were talking about context earlier and boy, sometimes can't you really step back

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.670
and think that there's another way to do something that's similar and follows

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.630
your principles, but can give you more value.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.900
And I see this damn thing happen in software all the time.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.540
It's like, Oh, so-and-so I respect so-and-so.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.740
And so-and-so said this, I'm going to do things exactly as they said and see

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.700
things no other way, no matter no, no matter what anybody else says.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.980
And they do this and people will say things that contradict so-and-so and they

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.540
go, Oh, you must be wrong.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:54.060
Cause you don't believe in what so-and-so is doing until so-and-so changes his mind.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.660
They go, Oh my God, he changed his mind.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.740
This is genius.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.860
And this happens in software all the time.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.700
And it happens in society, right?

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.380
You know what shepherds and their sheeple.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.140
It is.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.940
And so my advice to the world is don't be a sheep.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.130
Think for yourself.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.730
If you find that you're thinking and writing, um, it doesn't matter.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.770
I have people I follow and admire, uh, people like Doug Hubbard, but I don't take

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:24.010
everything he says and treat it like I must behave this way.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:30.090
I, I, ideas come from other ideas and the way I try and provide value to my team

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:35.210
and to society is by taking the ideas that I hear, that I hear and read and

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.610
study and listen and adapt them to whatever it is I'm doing.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.070
And so whether it's GQM or whether it's herd and sheep, it doesn't matter.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.880
My soapbox leadership tip for the day pulled randomly out 30 minutes

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:59.760
into this podcast, maybe 20 after editing is think for yourself.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.720
Be your, be your own person, be your own software engineer.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.360
All right.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.440
I'm off the soapbox trust, but verify GQM kind of kicked that off.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.200
It's like, cause I know people who are real zealots about that.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.560
And then it made me think of other, other situations in life and in software.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.600
And it's like you, it's okay.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.280
It's okay to admire people.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.440
It's okay to be a leader.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.120
It's okay to be a follower, but no matter what you have to think for yourself,

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.510
there, there are a large number of people who, who really prefer, um,

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.830
everyone's wired differently.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.270
There's a large number of people who really prefer, right.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.230
A structured formulaic way to succeed.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.840
And particularly in things like data science, where it's really, even though

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:51.160
it's been around for decades, right, because of how rapidly it's, it's

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.120
growing in and really how few people really understand it.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.920
Um, it's, I think it's fair to say it's, it's, it's entered into a new

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.270
stage of being nascent, right?

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:13.560
Um, so we're going to find people, some people, uh, data science is

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.880
absolutely a buzzword.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.160
Oh, it's just this magical statistical thing.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.280
Like one of the things that I'm, I'm seeing throughout Microsoft right now

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.760
is that there doesn't seem to be a distinction between data

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.960
science and machine learning.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:31.100
This is wrong, but, um, people have learned that those two words often

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.500
go together in the same sentence.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.220
Right.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:42.340
Um, on, I remember what I was going to say before, like one of the big secrets

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:48.990
about being able to use data and convert it into action is you're really

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:56.770
trying to, um, piece apart uncertainty.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.890
The uncertainty is basically as, as you've talked about it over and over again,

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:09.050
armor's rule is it's basically a method by which you turn the unknown into the

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.850
known, it's a suitable method for discovering what you don't know.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:12.450
You don't know.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:12.970
Right.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.530
And, um, you'll love this cause I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it, it,

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:25.510
it, um, it's been around for a very long time, but I don't, it's not a term

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:31.170
that's common within Microsoft and I'm imagining it will eventually be EDA

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.740
exploratory data analysis.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.180
Yes.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.380
Alan is already from his body language.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.300
He's already looking forward to XDA.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.880
You know, um, no, actually the thought that went through my head was I was

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.140
talking to some, uh, uh, colleagues, gosh, almost a year ago now.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.470
And we need to turn this around and answer my question too, but we're

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:03.200
talking about dashboards and viewing data and, and it was very much a

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.640
traditional let's look at data the way I've looked at test pass rates and,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.080
and it was very prescribed and straightforward.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.990
And I asked what I thought was a very simple question that, uh, I was just

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:22.060
surprised that given the people in the room, it hadn't been seemingly

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.860
considered, but I said, what about exploratory analysis of the data?

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.260
I can't now that words in my head, not sure what I use, but I said,

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.980
sometimes I just want to sift through data and flip things around and look

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.580
for insights, how are we going to do that?

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.080
Plank stare.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.020
Well, you should talk to so-and-so and see if that's possible.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:49.040
I'm like, uh, I think it's going to be kind of, and I'm, I am not, nor will

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.800
I likely ever be or admit to being, or use the word data science to

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.200
describe myself or what I do.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:01.400
But I'm a generalist and I do know how to use data.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.240
Maybe not to the degree of someone like Brent.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.600
But, uh, to me, it's just, that's basic.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.560
I, I have to be able to do that to make sense of the data, to figure out

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.400
what it means is how I get knowledge from it.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.080
Have you ever heard of the banana experiment?

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.230
Um, I think I saw a video once.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.700
I'm pretty sure it wasn't that.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.300
Oh, okay.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:23.660
Yeah.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:30.690
Um, banana experiment in a nutshell, a bunch of scientists put a bunch of

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:37.590
monkeys in a, in a, in a cage, a, in the head of ladder and a set of bananas on top

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:45.790
of it, um, anytime the, a monkey tried to climb up the ladder to get the bananas,

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:51.060
the scientists would spray cold water on all the other monkeys.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.470
They would consistently do this until it got to the point that the, the crowd

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:02.310
of monkeys would actually kick the ass of the monkey, trying to get the bananas.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.510
Okay.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.870
Every time another monkey went up, so they, they managed to change the behavior

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.190
of the monkeys in the cage.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:14.650
Once they had all of the monkeys doing this consistently, they would take out,

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.130
they would begin to swap monkeys.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.220
Okay.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.860
So they would bring in a new monkey, take another one out.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.900
That new monkey knew nothing of the system would go after the bananas.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.580
The crowd would kick his ass.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.860
They continued to do this and, uh, swap monkeys in and out until it got to the

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.540
point that the original set of monkeys were all gone.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.300
So there were no previously wet monkeys in the room.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.580
And you still got your ass kicked for trying to get the banana.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.100
Yes.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:47.100
And not a single monkey in that room had ever gotten sprayed by cold water.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.020
The other thing is, I think you do the same thing with some pizza on that

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.260
ladder and people do the same thing.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:52.980
Yeah.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.740
Well, think of it this way.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:00.420
Um, test pass rates, the traditional exit criteria score cards that we

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.860
use the ship over and over again.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.780
People aren't asking, why are we still doing this?

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.060
I am.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.180
Michael Hunter.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.020
I'm asking.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:17.700
Michael Hunter, um, uh, did this great analysis and investigation around some

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:27.580
of the statistics used in, uh, one of his last teams and what he discovered as

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.060
he was going through and he interviewed, uh, I think he said somewhere in between

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.820
30 and 50 people and what he discovered is not a lot of people knew why we were

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:43.220
using this metric and, and the, the belief in the value of the metric was

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:48.300
purely belief there was that the everyone sort of, it was sort of like the,

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.420
the underwear gnomes.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.640
It's actually, if we measure it, step one, measure it, step two, we

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.520
haven't figured that out yet.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.840
Step three, this KPI moves.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:33:59.860
Right.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.220
They, they, are you familiar with the underwear gnomes from South Park?

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.980
No, but that I'm sure I can watch a video on.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.340
They're, they have a three step plan.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.900
I step one is steal people's underwear.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.780
Step two, they haven't figured that out yet.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.500
Step three is massive profit.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:14.920
All right.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:15.920
Whatever.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.000
All right.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.840
Winding back.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.680
Like you're not going to have a successful dashboard with risks or without.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.520
If you don't know how do you want to use it?

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:26.840
Right.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.880
The very first thing.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.640
And that's exactly where I want to get to.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:35.040
I want, you know, for me, data driven quality is the data guides my work, not

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.240
just for the next milestone, not for the next sprint, but not only for that

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.360
week, but for that day.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:40.880
Yeah.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.160
And we don't have that now.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.240
I feel like, oh no, we do.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:44.720
We have it.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.920
We have it like crazy.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.800
Well, my team doesn't have that now.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.600
You just told me it does.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.200
Well, not in one view.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:56.760
I mean, guys, the word in multiple views, just to be a pedantic ask.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760
Right.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.120
Go on.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.420
Your team does have it.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.280
But you want to guide your work.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.440
This, this last bit is what's missing.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:06.410
Yeah.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.370
A valuable way.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:08.210
Okay.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:09.400
Right.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.880
I have no doubt that you have someone in your team.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.640
Not your right.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.840
Inuberate call stacks.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.140
But why do we care?

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:19.990
Everyone's like, what do you mean?

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.040
It's the number one call stack.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.000
Of course we got to fix it.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.860
Odds are we do got to fix it, but stop and tell me why.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.220
What's your proof?

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.660
Yeah.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.820
What I really want to get to, and you're right, because for me, when you

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.260
think about data driven quality, what I'll be able to do is have an easy way

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.140
for me to look and again, you're going to have views that are good for the team.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.140
Views that let you really dive in deep and get more information views that let

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.540
you explore, but what I want to look at is here's some information where I quickly

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.380
know here are the top N number of things we need to get done today.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.860
To provide the most value.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.120
That's the key insight.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.270
So it isn't just the data data training that I've done, but I've been in

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.310
services and I've been in agile and right.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.830
And one of the biggest problems is we have a limited number of.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.790
Is it agile?

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.350
Just another stupid buzzword.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.430
Shut up.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.420
Um, and yes, but shut up.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:21.240
The, every team has a limited number of resources, whether it be

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.080
people, equipment, or time.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.200
Right.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:31.120
So what we're really trying to do is, is use our insight validated by the data

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.630
to be able to in a nutshell, enumerate a backlog of work that's

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.590
ordered by the highest ROI.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.670
Isn't ROI just a stupid buzzword?

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:43.350
Okay.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.870
Yeah.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.840
You're, you're, uh, all right.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.720
Is there something more actionable or tactical you think I can

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.560
help you with on that one?

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.960
I, I, it's good to talk through it.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.800
And it's one of those things where I, you gave me the answer that.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.280
Uh, there's probably a name for this sort of thing where I wanted to look

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.880
for some, what I wanted from you was like some great insight and says

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.680
you absolutely have to do this.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.580
But instead you told me really what I already knew, which is good.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.020
It reiterated like, yeah, you're right.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.020
I need, this is exactly what I need to do.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.500
It doesn't matter how it looks.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.340
Uh, but yeah,

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:26.450
there are suggestions I can give you, but it's, it is very context sensitive.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:27.690
Absolutely.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.410
And as you just got through saying, I don't want to tell you a bunch of

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:36.010
things, um, and we, we, we can go talk about it offline, but I don't want to

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:40.490
tell you a bunch of things and, and have you or our listeners then view the,

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.250
Oh, we had this fantastic formulaic equation.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.130
We'll just follow it.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.490
And in hindsight, you don't want that.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:50.130
And you see that another thing I see often, especially, well, actually

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:56.300
both inside and outside of Microsoft is, uh, people want like the solution.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.920
But what they really need is how to think about the solution.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.280
And we kind of, even though I was, I fell into the same trap, I was looking for,

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.520
give me an example of what a solution would look like.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.560
But instead we talked about how I should think about what that looks like.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.320
And that's in the end, more valuable.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.080
The solution is in the system and your, your system is likely different

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.920
than anyone else's or any team you've been on.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.220
Hey, can I go off on a random topic, not on the board?

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:26.490
Sure.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:26.850
Sure.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:27.250
Why not?

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.690
Because that never happens.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.530
No, why would we do that here?

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.890
So I ran into one of our colleagues, Steve Rowe.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.130
Oh, I think it was last week.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.450
He's a listener.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:37.850
I'm a big fan of Steve Rowe.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:38.650
He is.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:43.410
I'm a big fan of every one of our listeners, but, uh, I'm actually

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.770
happy we didn't get there today.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.530
This is going to be a segue here eventually, but he, uh, said something

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.850
to the effective and I'm sorry for paraphrasing, Steve, that, uh, that

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:57.490
our podcast was sort of for Microsoft people, because we do talk a little

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:01.650
bit or actually a lot about sort of Microsofty things, but I think a

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:06.640
lot of these things are sort of valuable outside of Microsoft, don't you think?

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.880
It was interesting.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.880
So I know in a way I knew he was right, but I wanted to talk about it anyway.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.640
We've frame it from, from our experience.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.280
We frame it from a Microsoft way.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.480
How many years you've been at Microsoft?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.720
Uh, 20 now.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.360
So about about 40 between us.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.520
So we, I think that's, that's kind of where our context comes from.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.750
But, um, and, and it certainly is a part of our podcast is discussing sort of the,

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:36.870
the, the, the trials and tribulations we are having and trying to, to introduce,

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:43.970
um, uh, an injection of the outside culture in, right?

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:50.630
Uh, and we have a belief and it's been validated by, by tweets and, and

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:54.710
emails and things like that, that other people are kind of going through

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:55.790
these same sort of problems.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:00.910
If we look at a customer, I know, cause we, we talked to it, but if we look at

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:07.440
our listener base, I'm fairly certain that it's a head tail curve and that most of

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.840
them are the, the top of the, of the, the head is Microsoft guys.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.360
But I actually think we have more listeners outside of Microsoft.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.080
That sounds right to me.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.520
Uh, so a couple of things I wanted to mention, I actually forgot one of them.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.840
It'll come back to me in a moment.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.960
Uh, oh, I read an article and I'm not going to go into details.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.360
Is it mad?

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.200
Cause it's one of many, or at least a handful of sort of things I've seen

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.520
talking about what software engineering or testing is like at Microsoft.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.520
And they're all just, it's weird.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.560
I read them and I go, well, this isn't right at all.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.800
This is sort of skewed.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.880
And then unfortunately I see like in the footnotes, they've, their

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.720
references are like my blog.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.600
I go, oh man, I got to be more clear because obviously what I wrote

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.320
is open for interpretation.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.320
Uh, I should probably, uh, respond to some of those in blog form sometime, but it's

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:01.680
weird.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.710
Uh, it's also the interpretation.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.410
It also has a half life, right?

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.970
A big portion of your book.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.170
And I think you blogged on that.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.890
Like when did you write your book?

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.290
Uh, I started at like, well, I started at

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:21.490
nine years ago, like 10 years ago, or I wrote the first chapter, uh, about

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:22.850
just over nine years ago.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:24.450
When was it available for purchase?

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.290
Uh, just over about six, just over six years ago.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:27.810
Okay.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.650
How much of it is still true today?

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.170
Um, half, half, maybe half.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:40.320
So it goes from, um, untrue to non-relevant to flat out wrong.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.960
And that's, that's probably half to three quarters of the book.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.120
Some parts are like some parts I'm still hold up model based testing

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.240
chapter, I think still holds up.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.300
Yep.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.460
I'm very happy with that chapter.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:55.420
What percent would you say is not relevant versus note flat out wrong?

00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:01.170
Um, gosh, at least a quarter of it is non relevant.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.620
Probably especially stuff around, you know, how engineering works.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.900
The first couple of chapters.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.780
Um, there's depends how you look at it.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.340
And we've, I don't want to rehash this because I have other stuff to talk about,

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.940
but some of it's just a lot of the activities I talk about in the book are

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:23.720
now done by, um, the development teams, mostly done, but it's still done or not

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.200
done, but there's the, I don't know.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.600
Open source has gotten hugely dominant.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.920
So a lot of how to think through the test architecture framework is,

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.720
I don't know how to break it down.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.320
I, there's a, I wrote a blog post kind of walking through the section by section.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.400
So I could go look at that and give you a better number, but it's interesting.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:42.520
Yeah.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.280
There's a half life.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.640
Some of it's quite relevant and I would use today and the half life is changing.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.600
Like, yeah, it's just as a, as a, as a, as a thought exercise.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.640
If you were to, if you were to, um, pretend like you wrote it or that it got

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:04.150
released 16 years ago and it then advanced six, six years, what do you think the

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.830
relevancy would have been at that new six year point?

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:14.120
Oh, it's probably, it's a convoluted way of you asking or implying that

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.880
things have changed a lot more in the last six years and they didn't

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.400
15 years before then is particularly in the test.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:19.960
Yeah.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.680
And that's absolutely true.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.920
If I wrote it 16 years ago, six years after that, it still would have

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.680
been highly relevant, applicable.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.960
It's sort of a Moore's law of testing.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.880
What I think I need to do maybe to get test and software to kick it into

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.400
gear again and make more massive changes is read another book.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.360
Sure.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:39.680
Sure.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.680
That's a, the data scientist, air quote in Brent just said, that's

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.940
not a valid indicator of change, but correlation with that.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.940
I just skipped over.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:56.080
I just skipped over to I, one of the things that I think is really cool

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:01.080
about you as you've written a number, number of books, I just don't

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.520
have the patience for that.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.840
Like one, one difference between Alan and I, and we may have talked

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.880
about it before we've, we shared notes on how long it takes us to write a blog.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.200
Alan, he and I could write a blog on a similar topic.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.040
It will take Alan about a half hour.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.160
It will take me about five hours.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:21.540
Right.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.180
It, I'm like, okay.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:27.060
So Alan wrote a book, took him about a year to complete it.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.900
It would take me about five years using that same metric.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.580
Therefore, by the time I was done, it's completely irrelevant.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.100
This is kind of like the, like painting the Golden Gate bridge by the

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.780
time you're done painting it, you have to start over again.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:40.460
Yeah.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.260
Something like that.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.580
Hey, the reason I brought up this subject was not to yet again.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.340
Now, now that everybody's turned off the podcast, rehash, uh, how

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:52.940
we can software at Microsoft, but no, it was all about how awesome is Alan?

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.940
No, um, that wasn't it either.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:59.850
But I, I talked about this a few other times and I think there's a new

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:01.330
segment I'd like to bring to the show.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:01.650
Yeah.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:05.890
And I don't quite have the, I'm not sure what the reverb or effect going

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:11.570
into it is, but we've talked about, well, I think you'll know what I'm talking.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:15.800
If you're a long time listener, I'll just call this segment dumb things

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:22.080
people do at Microsoft and we've talked about some of them before.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:22.960
I won't rehash.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.800
You can dig them out of the old podcast, but the one I haven't mentioned yet.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.720
So it's sort of an agile, an agile rewrite of Microsoft.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:37.850
Well, I'm working at, I'm just again, Copeland, if you're listening, not

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:39.930
Patrick, Doug, the other wrote Microsoft.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:44.050
I'm ideas, the color for your, for your next book on Microsoft.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.490
Um, which the other one's now over 20 years old.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.610
So do you have a new dumb thing we do?

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:49.930
I do.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.210
And, and really it's just things that pissed me off.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.850
It could be called that, but that's not as important.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.680
So, um, I'm in this organization.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.000
My team is part of a larger organization and there's a very large distribution

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.400
list, email list, a couple thousand people, and it's relevant information

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.240
about, uh, our overall product, uh, discussions around, you know, things

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.520
that aren't working, et cetera, et cetera.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.880
It is a huge list, lots of traffic.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.640
I have a folder, thank goodness, where all these things go and I can browse them

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.800
and condense them and look at the things they think are important in

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.570
order to gain knowledge, uh, to help me maybe even do my job.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.970
Do all of your daily automated status reports go to that alias?

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.360
No, I don't even know what you just said.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.440
I just tuned out partway through the multisyllabic words.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:42.310
The point is, I don't know where this happened to Microsoft culture, but at

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:47.790
some point, someone got the idea that, Hey, this thread is no longer relevant

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.100
to everyone on the thread.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:56.830
So I am going to block BCC, the thread to cut down the recipient list.

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.890
So the first line of the mail is usually BCC to remove large alias.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.640
Well, thank you, you stupid little, you just broke my rules and

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.160
put that into a folder that I actually read and care about.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.640
I don't care about your damn mail.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:22.910
Why do you think it's cool or relevant or interesting at all?

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.870
Why do you think that you're being clever or smart or anything other

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:29.150
than a stupid dip by doing that?

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.800
They actually, they're there.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.480
It's, it's interesting.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.720
No, it's not interesting.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.200
I've never actually stupid.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.440
And if one, every time it happens, I want to reach through my

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.840
ethernet cable and punch the person in the throat.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.680
I have long since given up making rules actually work because I've

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.040
been, I'm an inbox zero kind of guy.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.040
If my, I keep, if I, my inbox is more than like 10 items, I'm

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.360
uncomfortable, I'm freaking out.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.260
So then the, and I have, so I have, wait, my rules work as I have, if

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.620
I'm on the tour, CC line, or if it's from my boss, it goes to my inbox.

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.300
Okay.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.300
Or my wife goes to my inbox.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.100
Good call.

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.020
Everything else has rules.

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.940
And then there's, I have this inbox other for things that go to, I don't

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.220
have rules for, so like my pry two mail folder, pry one is my inbox.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.020
I have my inbox other pry two.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.260
Um, so I look at that throughout the day.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.580
I don't, I don't look at my folders.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.060
Um, there may be on the weekends or at night, or if I'm really bored,

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:29.290
I'll go look at the things that have been filed or if I, or if I

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:33.330
need to dig up information, but I look at my inbox regularly and my, in

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:37.450
my other inbox, my pry two inbox, uh, several times throughout the day.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:42.690
So if you break my rules, you are polluting my pry two inbox and

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:45.090
bastards, I have a horse.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.050
And again, it's probably somebody who's listening.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.730
It's going, who the hell cares?

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:52.050
Or saying, saying things like, why do you use email?

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.490
Why can't you communicate in other ways?

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:57.090
Because we're backward and we only know how to communicate via email.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.770
That's why that.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.230
Yammer's starting to pick up.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.830
It is.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.150
I wish it were.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.030
It isn't in, in my world.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:11.560
Well, in my world, you know, we had a group say, we're going to have a Yammer

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:17.760
group and their answer after being unable to actually monitor the group

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.640
because they forgot about it was to decide to move the group back to a distribution

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:21.960
list.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.400
No, that's because a bunch of people, I don't want to change.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.320
I'm afraid of change.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.720
That's what I'm talking about.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.440
That's what I'm talking about.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.800
I actually, so the, the Yammer group we did in my last group, um,

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:40.490
I got to the point where I would say, Hey guys, I now I figured out why Yammer

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:41.890
has a particular policy.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.450
I thought it was just to dog food.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.010
No, there's a wisdom to it.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:51.190
So from here on out, anything on this, on this topic, just want to let you know.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:57.600
I am a big believer and I want to be able to use this and help others

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.400
come by and self-service.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.120
So I'm not going to answer anything on this topic unless it's

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.160
posted to the Yammer group.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.280
I told them what my behavior was going to be and I'm going to

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.400
told them why and because I told them why they were like, okay, fine.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.320
Well, Brent, you are, I would consider you an

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.560
embracer of change.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:14.640
I do.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.840
A bulk of the people I work with are so afraid of change that they would

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.920
rather shove a rusty nail under their fingernail than change.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.080
But once I did that, that became the common behavior.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.400
So it only took, I only had to reinforce that for about three months.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.920
And then it became the new muscle.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.440
Did you spray cold water on them?

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.240
They didn't go to the, you'll go to Yammer.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.280
I did the equivalent.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.400
Yes.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.160
I acknowledged that I am a huge knowledge bottleneck, uh, for your

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.600
forward progress right now, and I am happy to unblock it, but

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.880
you have to do this first.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:48.400
All right.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:48.880
Hey, Brett.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.320
Yeah, we're out of time.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.080
We are.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.320
So thanks for slogging through another episode.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.840
We're on number 20 next time.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.640
I'm excited for that.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.520
In number 20 and it will for sure be one year.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.080
All right.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.720
Uh, I'll bring, I'm not bringing cake.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.560
I may bring shots.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.520
Okay.

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.200
All right.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:05.760
Hey everybody.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.480
Uh, I'm Alan and I'm Brent.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.160
Thanks for listening.
