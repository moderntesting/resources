WEBVTT

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.440
Hey everybody, I'm Alan.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.940
I'm Brent.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.360
And we're back for another episode of AAB Testing.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.680
Episode 89, ready to go.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.600
We are ready to go.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.840
AAB Testing is your podcast for all kinds

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.760
of fun conversation between Alan on A and Brent.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720
He's the B, among many other things.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.260
We talk about software development,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.000
software testing, software engineering,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
organizational change.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.280
Did I say agile already?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.800
I really need to write this down.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.280
All kinds of fun stuff.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.440
Thank you for listening.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.920
We shifted our schedule for a week, off by weeks,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.680
or a week late on this one.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.600
But that's cool.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.410
Life happens, stuff happens, holidays happen.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.290
But I think we're ready to go.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.530
Actually, before we dive in, what's been up, Brent?

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930
Anything new and exciting?

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.780
How's Azure?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.150
Azure's great.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.270
My corporate slave drivers have dictated

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730
that is the correct answer.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.770
Awesome to hear.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.600
Awesome to hear.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.440
Yeah, it's an exciting time and place to be.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.440
Always good to have a little bit of excitement in your life

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.090
once in a while.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.970
Yeah, outages.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.530
So there was a recent outage that's gotten a lot of press.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.290
That's what I'm indirectly teasing you about.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.610
It's cool.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.250
You don't have to talk about it.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.450
Yeah, I cannot talk about it.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.970
One thing I was going to ask you is,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.010
it's September now.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.570
Have all your employees survived,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.210
and you survived a Microsoft review season?

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.650
We have, yes.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.250
You can put it behind you at slacking time at Microsoft,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.810
other than dealing with outages.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.650
And you guys can worry about ramping up that workload back

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.970
in April or May for next year.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.970
That's always good to know.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.170
Right, it's now nine months of coasting.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.250
So none on my team, unfortunately.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.530
One of the things that we've successfully done.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.890
So my team's specialization is in customer analytics.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.410
And we spent the last six months diving into customer support

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.370
problems.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.890
And it has garnered a lot of viral visibility,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.860
the good kind of visibility, not the bullshit kind

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.330
that you see PMs do.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.810
So we're in high demand.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.580
And unfortunately, my team is still really itty bitty.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.810
I do have two positions opening.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.570
Not applying.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.010
Actually, I'm not qualified.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.970
And not applying.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.810
Oh, I would change the job description

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.610
to hire you as an employee, Alex.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.610
Just for the week of morale boost, that would bring me.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:07.140
No, so I don't think if there's anyone who's

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.180
interested in a data science position,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.020
I am looking for experienced folks.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.170
I'm not certain where our listeners are on that one.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.090
I think we mostly cater to the testing crowd, not

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.210
the data science crowd.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.130
Oh, oh.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.770
Speaking of things I can't talk about,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.890
but I can talk about about.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.450
Gotcha.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.290
Following.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.690
I'm not sure if this person is a member of the three on Slack.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.610
I'm pretty sure they are not.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.980
But did hire a podcast listener.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.460
Did you?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.540
For her position in Austin.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.820
I'll make a big announcement.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.740
Oh, you got your.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.940
Yeah, got.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.580
Yeah, I'm very, very excited.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.860
Do I know the person?

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.700
Maybe through Twitter.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.700
I'm not sure.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.180
Anyway, very excited.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.660
More information on that later, once it becomes,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.220
I mean, stuff's been signed, but I never

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.210
talk about hires before.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.250
I guess that's common courtesy across the industry, right?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.460
When I was hired at Unity, they knew

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.740
I was going there for a while,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.060
but they waited to make it, to tell people

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.740
that I was going there before.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:25.220
No, so you don't know what this person has announced

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.220
that they're asking.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.620
Right, right, it's their call to make.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.500
But I can say that someone who has listened to the podcast

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.860
has accepted a position on my team at Unity,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.340
and I couldn't be more excited.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.860
This is somebody not only will make their development team

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.860
better, but I think will make me better as well.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.820
So it's super exciting.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.990
Super.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.190
Sometimes crap just works out, and you get really

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.270
excited about it.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.030
I don't remember, yeah, this is probably

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.140
one of the most exciting hires I've made.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.100
For as far as like, what's going to happen?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.980
It's going to be great.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.780
Oh my god.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.180
Cool.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.020
So that happened.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.860
That's cool.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.620
Are they already in Texas?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.620
Yes.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.540
Oh.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.220
Yes, yes.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.020
I'll leave it at that.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.280
No, that's not enough for me to guess.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.680
Although it might be later.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.360
All right.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.920
There was something else I was going to share today, but.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.640
You got the P.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.320
Oh, a couple things, two things.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.280
One thing, PNSQC conference is coming up,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.760
Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference in Oregon,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.080
as it's properly pronounced, in Portland,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.360
coming up beginning of October.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.440
Pretty reasonably priced conference.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.880
It's a lot of value there.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.760
Again, highly recommended.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.680
Also the last conference I'm planning on doing for some

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.070
time.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.350
I have nothing else on the radar.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.870
I'll probably continue to do some webinars once in a while.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.350
Speaking of webinars, I did a webinar a few months ago

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.090
with Aaron Kinsburger.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.930
But also from Aaron just finished editing and writing

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.890
compilation for a book called Continuous Testing for DevOps

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.850
Professionals.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.290
And I believe some of the three have contributed

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.590
chapters to this book.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.110
Cool.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.310
So that book is coming out.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.510
I'm pretty excited about it.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.150
More information as it's out.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.870
But there's a launch coming up in conjunction

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.710
with the conference.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.150
If I had my crap together, I could give you all the details.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.510
But keep an eye out for it.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.030
Very cool.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.470
I'm super excited about that book.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.990
I had the opportunity to review it all.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.630
I read about 75% of it.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.150
And it's all pretty good stuff.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.550
He gathered together some good writing, some great ideas.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.460
I'm pretty happy.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.100
So yeah, and that's pretty much it for me on the conference.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.620
Do you know?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.100
How much does it align with MT?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.380
I think it aligns quite a bit with modern testing.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.780
I think the main difference, it's something to talk about.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.460
Maybe in a future episode is there's

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.140
a lot of really good things like Accelerate, the DevOps book.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.220
This book aligns a lot with modern testing.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.380
This book, I would say, the difference is it assumes that

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.980
there's, which is fine, I guess,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.900
it assumes there's a testing and quality specialist

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.330
on the team to drive a lot of these things.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.730
Not all, but a lot of these things where we think we don't,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.890
you know our stance.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.250
I do.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.770
That's OK as a transitionary.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.490
That's probably the right thing.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.930
It may be the right thing long term for in some cases.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.290
I'll leave an exception there.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.370
Let's start using differentiating language.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.740
Is it a test specialist or is it a testing coach?

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.260
The way I read it, because I read everything

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.220
through an MT lens now.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.900
I could see a lot of things as ideas for test coaches

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.100
as well.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.940
It wasn't written that way, but I can read it that way

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.260
pretty easily.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:04.400
Yeah, did you see the Ministry of Testing post I sent you?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.120
Yeah, I did.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.200
And actually that person, if I actually had internet

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.920
in Microsoft, because they don't share their internet

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.760
without filling out a form, I could bring up that person

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.100
actually pinged me on Twitter a while back.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.900
God, we are so freaking unprepared.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.060
We didn't even write up the Kanban board today.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.380
No, that's your job.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.860
That is from Robert Meany.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.500
It was Robert Meany's thing, right?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.060
Right.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.820
So Robert Meany, there was a whole Twitter thing

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.380
where he was pinging me.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.100
And he actually said, if you're interested in hearing

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.740
about my experiences as a test coach,

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.740
I did a talk at Test Bash Dublin recently.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.420
You should check out.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.100
There's a link.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.300
And I don't have a pro dojo account,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.500
so I haven't watched it yet.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.460
Yeah, why don't we have pro dojo accounts?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.580
I think we need, someone needs to sponsor pro dojo accounts

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.580
for A-B testing.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.700
Absolutely.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.220
Like Ministry of Testing, guys, what up?

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:11.340
Yeah, Test Bash is the official conference of A-B testing.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.660
We should probably bring, this is going to be eventually

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.780
a mailbag episode, but for now an all tangent episode.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.380
One thing, I think we brought it up on the channel

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.860
or in a private discussion with you is,

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.060
I'll just throw this out here.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.260
This could be 2019.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.220
It could be 2020.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.820
It could be 2021.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.190
But there should be a Test Bash Seattle.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.930
Oh, I figured there were one or two places you were going to go.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.570
Well, that's one place.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.290
But no, it gets better.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.170
Test Bash Seattle.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.930
It gets better.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.370
The MT conference or the MT book.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.370
I wasn't certain which one you were talking about.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.970
Why don't you shut up and let me talk.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.290
Test Bash is usually Thursday.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.570
It's a Friday conference.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.530
Now I can't remember.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.290
But usually, yeah, I think it's a Friday conference.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.690
But there's always a day after thing.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.970
And when I was in Brighton, there

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.970
was an unconference on Saturday where 30, 40 people?

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.850
30 people showed up.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.890
And we just unconference, like open space whiteboard thing.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.890
Right at Nia's, people vote with their feet.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.170
And you set it up as you get there.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.970
But that was fun.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.930
I liked those.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.450
Nothing wrong with those.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.010
But when you and I host Test Bash in Seattle,

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.050
the following day is modern testing conference.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.090
Can it be a modern testing unconference?

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.250
Yes, absolutely.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.290
I do love open space style.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.490
We should merge the two.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.660
You're right.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.260
So anyway, because we're doing that,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.540
we should get our sponsored pro accounts.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.940
Anyway, back on task.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.180
I don't disagree.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.620
But I actually think, yeah, I mean, I think.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.620
Maybe there aren't really.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.300
I think we've already satisfied that criteria.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.660
All right.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.940
But anyway, so Robert Meany will just

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.820
do a free hawking for Ministry of Testing.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:14.610
Robert Meany is doing a meet up in Ireland, apparently,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.470
talking about the name of his talk

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.430
is from tester to test coach, a voyage into the unknown.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.150
And I saw this, and I'm like, that is fantastic.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.390
I don't know if that's MT inspired.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.390
I'm guessing it is.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.270
But it's certainly MT aligned.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.350
It's MT aligned for sure.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.150
And I think it's more aligned than inspired.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.430
I think he, there's a whole long string of tweets

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.190
I won't get into.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.270
But yeah, he gets it.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.750
He gets it.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.390
Brandt, look at you and I.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.620
We're not the most original thinkers in the world.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.380
Where do ideas come from?

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.060
Other ideas coming together.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.540
But the thing is, it would be dumb of us

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.380
to think that very similar, highly aligned ideas wouldn't

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.540
develop separately in other places from us.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.500
And that's what we found out as we've

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.580
been talking about modern testing in public.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.020
People go, oh, great, we do that.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.050
That's a name for what we do.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.330
And that's great to hear.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.650
I don't know.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:20.010
I mean, jeez, we've been talking about MT for,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.050
I don't even know how long, but since at least 60,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.810
episode 60, is that a year?

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.050
I don't know.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.840
And we've stated all along, we're not inventing anything new.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.160
True.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.400
The only thing new, I guess, would be,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.560
we think these seven principles are the key guideposts.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.480
Yes.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.880
And interestingly, if I remember right,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.880
I think the evolution was, I thought

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.360
we should have principles.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.960
And I made some crummy principles.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.080
So we iterated, and we iterated, et cetera,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.120
and telecubic that we have, which I really like.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.060
But what's interesting is that, I think I mentioned this

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.900
before, is that the modern testing principles actually

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.980
align really well with the three ways of DevOps.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.770
A lot of our stuff, we're not,

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.980
we're dealing with the world as it is.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.420
I would say one of the most important things about MT

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:25.100
is the rejection of traditional test methods

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.140
in today's world.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.540
Yes, yes.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.820
The old ways don't work anymore.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.500
What got you here is not gonna get you there.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.700
No, what got you there is gonna get you unemployed.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.540
Yes.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.450
Yes.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.570
All right, shall we, anything else

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.770
before we begin the show proper?

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.170
No, let's dance.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.280
So we have questions, questions, questions

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.080
from our listeners, and do you wanna go

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.260
in the order I printed these out?

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.300
No.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.180
Okay, so I printed some out some questions

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.060
I've received in my email, as well as from Slack.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.460
If you've had a question that you've given us

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.220
that we don't get to today, please follow up

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.580
because we're horrible at organizing these things.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.100
We need to get better.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.940
Why?

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.410
Which question do you wanna start with?

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.960
I'll go ahead and read it.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.080
I stumbled across your podcast through

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.720
the Ministry of Testing newsletter.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.440
Just finished listening to this episode.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.160
Not certain which episode.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.770
That's a couple ago.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.650
What you described resonates with my experience

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.610
as a tester where I work.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.650
I joined the company as a testing specialist six years ago,

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.330
primarily focused on process improvement

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.450
and where required manual testing,

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.810
progressively less over the years.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.170
Sadly, the terms I am leaving under

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.170
are just as you described.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.700
There's no longer a need for me.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.940
Quality has been baked into the process well enough.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.300
Fortunately, I've managed to find a role

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.020
with another company as a senior test engineer.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.820
I was wondering if you could elaborate

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.580
on where you see individuals like myself

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.280
gravitating towards.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.980
Do we need to consider a career change?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.220
Is management the only way forward?

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:22.030
Is job hopping every few years all that's left?

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.790
Curious to hear your thoughts.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.310
Yeah, it's a great question.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.470
This is from Rajiv Makhani.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.750
This is about episode 88.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.510
So thanks Rajiv for sending me a-

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.830
Oh, literally last episode.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:33.670
Yeah.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.510
Well, yeah.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.350
Yeah.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.170
Great questions.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.750
You were able to read the question.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.670
I'm gonna let you start.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.980
There's a lot of, is the role of a modern tester

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.680
just to be a coach to help one by one

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.580
help every team in the world get there?

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.420
On this one, I forget what we said in 88,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.520
but I don't think I'm gonna say anything that contradicts.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.520
In my view, one of the main reasons why we are doing MT

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.010
is exactly that.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:13.010
We think everyone in test needs to begin the process

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.770
of considering a career change.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.550
There are multiple options here.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.000
Career management is not the only way forward.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
To be clear, I'm gonna interrupt.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.680
I would, because it's not necessarily a career change,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.320
but it might be a career shift.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.580
I don't think it's a revolution.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.720
I do think it's more of a evolution.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.920
So let me talk about what, let's say I was

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.480
at a much smaller company and I was doing what I do

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.680
as an individual contributor.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.260
Okay, how much smaller?

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.660
Like five, six people?

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.700
No, let's say I'm comfortable doing this with 50 to 100.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.220
Okay, so I am helping this team accelerate

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.820
the leadership quality.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.740
I'm helping them build that quality culture.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.220
I kind of dive in on hands-on stuff.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.980
So as they build this quality culture,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.900
there are things I've gravitated toward in my career.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.540
I do a lot of work with CI, a lot of static analysis,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.820
a lot of work with Gates, a lot of work with

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.420
not as much as you, but with data.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.620
Those are gonna be my specialties.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.160
None of those things are testing.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.460
I'm there to help coach the team

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.060
towards testing and quality.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.420
But I would assume that, and I've also done dev work

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.460
and shipped code on almost every project

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.380
I've worked on at Microsoft as a tester.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.680
So for me, and again, I'm going to follow,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.520
I'm just going to do more, if the quality culture is there

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.080
and I don't need to do any more testing

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.760
or test frameworks, because everybody else

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.880
is taking care of that.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.440
I would naturally, this is just me,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.450
fall towards the other things I am good at

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.450
that provide value to the product.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.170
And of course, I'm there to look,

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.770
when things shift off the rails,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.050
I'm still around to maybe ask the right questions

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.810
in a retrospective or make sure as new employees come on,

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.490
they have the right mentoring and coaching,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.770
or make sure that that culture is not lost.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.440
But I think all testers who are,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.360
my guess is that all testers who are leading teams

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.720
towards modern testing have a bunch of other skills

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.280
that they can begin to leverage more

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.440
as they begin to do less testing.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.440
Or adapting their skills towards a new mechanism.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.080
We talked about one poll survey,

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.080
I don't know, about a year ago,

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.080
that noticed that there was a shift in QA teams

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.880
away from more dev-focused KPIs towards business-focused KPIs.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:57.830
The way I take this on in a mentoring relationship

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.590
is I walk people through, like look,

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.590
these are the strengths that a testing specialist

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.750
brings to the table.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.750
And I almost never bring in the word testing.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:18.600
That's an activity, but they have customer empathy

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.360
that is absolutely a strength,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.360
which is still valuable in different roles.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.760
Those that are fond of automation

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.760
or shrinking time on that front.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.640
DevOps is a very suitable and growing role.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.680
Which is weird because DevOps is a culture, but anyway.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.600
It is a culture.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.560
So it's quality, it's all right.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.600
But it is very common for teams when they realize

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.840
that they need that organization to hire in folks

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.320
to bootstrap.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.840
The first thing you do when you need to incorporate

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.360
this muscle is you hire in people who will do it for you

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.280
and then you make the shift towards.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.840
Just like with testing.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.000
Just like with data.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.840
For sure.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.760
On the other hand, there could be,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.800
I could see a future where development teams,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.120
organizations, companies,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.360
whether they call it modern testing or not,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.400
see a need to be able to develop a quality culture.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.600
Like how do we build that?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.120
And then there's people that they hire to come in

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.600
for one to three years and help them build that.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.960
So it could be, there is, I think for some people,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.310
it's a job hopping role.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.150
There is.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.150
It's harder right now because what you have is skills

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.910
that will help a company do something

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.760
they probably don't know they need.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.560
Yeah, and I think actually just traditional testing,

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.600
I think there's still a lot of years left

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.680
where job hopping will succeed in that,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.260
but I think it's gonna shrink.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.620
My best advice is not even mine.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.340
I don't remember my source,

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.460
but there was a study that came out

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.020
that basically detailed something

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.980
Alan actually proselytizes quite often.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.260
I have never proselytized in public.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.500
That is unfair for you to say.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.260
Is this considered public?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.600
Sure. Okay.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.430
Wait, what does proselytize mean?

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.270
Preach.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.990
Okay, yeah, I do that all the time.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.950
I should have just used preach in the first place.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.230
Yeah, why use a long word when a short one will do?

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:51.230
You know, if I hear one more person use the word utilize,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.870
where they are supposed to use use,

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.350
it's not even the synonym.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.190
I'm gonna blow up.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:01.590
It is absolutely synonym, lookupsynonym.com.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.320
Should I utilize synonyms.com?

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.160
If you'd like.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.000
Oh God.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.960
Okay, back on track.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.240
You use short words.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.040
So what the study showed is in particular

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.630
in the software industry,

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:22.070
that there is rapid change occurring

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.790
in terms of the skill sets.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.660
Five years from now,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.100
I think the standard developer is gonna have

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.860
to have basic data science training

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.460
because it's gonna be a key part of their job.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.920
Yeah.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.920
What is a key differentiator is constant relearning.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.040
In the software industry,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.000
that I think above anything else

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.160
is going to be critical if you wanna build a career.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.040
Absolutely, and we've said that before

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.480
talking about other things.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.840
Like what I'm hiring,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.040
I want ability to learn over random coding trivia.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.880
Always.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.560
Because the language you use today

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.880
is probably gonna be,

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.480
less it's JavaScript unfortunately,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.300
is probably gonna be a relic in five years.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.260
So I think I've shared with this,

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.510
with you before.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.830
I treat my team like a startup.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:23.500
I run it like a fake startup.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.340
All right, I'm constantly thinking through

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.020
the scenario of if me and this team

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.380
were an actual startup,

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.800
would my customers pay for an extended contract?

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.160
Right, how do I constantly get that business?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.380
Now, I am now in one of the giant tech companies.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.950
So those consequences aren't necessarily

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.950
something that I need to be concerned with.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.630
But in my particular world,

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:04.900
credibility, there are other commodities

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.340
that I can use to track how successful my team is doing.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.900
And one of the things I have to think about

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.620
is the skill sets of my team.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.940
And are there opportunities that I cannot take on

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.250
because I lack those skills?

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.770
One thing that has happened to me lately,

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.290
thankfully none of my team listened to this podcast,

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.090
but one of the things that has happened to me lately.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.050
Unfortunately, for better or for worse,

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.530
much of my team listened to this podcast.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.570
Well, one of the things that I've been thinking through

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.720
is for example, I have some folks on my team

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
that aren't there yet in terms of data science.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.600
And I'm thinking through,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.720
I probably have two years or so

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.930
where I need to aggressively train those folks up

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.330
or else it's going to actually be better for my business

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.570
to let them go and hire new people

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.170
because there will be new people

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.170
who already have that training.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.890
So I want to balance being a people coach

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.290
as well as a business leader.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.050
And when it comes to job hopping,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.090
I think actually I'm not alone

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.570
in terms of how do I evaluate these things.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.250
If I went back to a peer dev position,

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.970
I would not hire a test specialist.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.410
Now, part of that is because I'm sufficient

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.890
as the testing coach on that team.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:34.290
But it's not hard to bring in people

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.810
on new or retrained folks towards this culture.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.440
I just wouldn't do it.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.000
It's too expensive.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.960
We have a couple of milestones on the Slack channel.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.160
First and foremost in the last month,

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.920
we've had people join the Slack channel

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.480
that the one of the three listeners,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.920
but they aren't actually listeners.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.440
I still don't quite know what to do with that.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.720
But you may have seen it.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.280
So we have a peer dev who joined.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.120
I saw.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.000
Right, and one of the issues he had.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.080
Because modern testing isn't about testing.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.120
It's not, well.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.440
Right, not directly.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.320
Anyway, go on.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.800
Yeah, so there is a rising concern

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.480
around traditional test methods being a bottleneck.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.280
And in his particular case,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.480
he couldn't get a security patch out

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.960
because tests couldn't test it in time.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.150
And a security patch is something you gotta get out.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.630
And so he's going through,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.030
okay, how do I scale this activity?

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.530
I think more and more and more that is on the way.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.890
If you're fond of the test traditional method,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.410
yep, I do think you're in for a good bit

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:05.570
of job hopping.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.090
But there are, you don't have to take that choice.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.050
Right, what I would suggest,

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.530
and I normally do this in a one-on-one situation,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:20.530
is introspect, think about what are your strengths.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:25.930
See if you can find sort of a technical career coach

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.090
that can help you, guide you towards,

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.370
hey, maybe you should think about the DevOps path.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.770
Maybe you should think about.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.770
One thing I should mention, interesting,

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:40.130
is one of my former leads, quality leads,

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.690
on our ads team where we no longer have QA,

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.030
is now a DevOps lead.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.030
Nice.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:51.210
And what I've told him is, it's kind of the same thing.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.050
Same goal, same goal, work yourself out of a job.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.570
There's some work to do there,

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.610
you gotta build the culture.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.890
But I think it's a great place for him to be.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.130
Because he can drive the quality culture

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.170
from there as well.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:08.200
No, and actually, I actually think that those folks

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.560
who work to just make the culture part of muscle memory,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.400
succeeding in that develops, my hypothesis is,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.520
succeeding in that develops within you

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.000
a certain set of strengths and skills

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.840
that make you immensely valuable.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.080
It might be another episode or two

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.600
to decompose what those are.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.440
Yeah.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.680
But I've seen it over and over and over

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.220
and over and over again.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.140
Sure.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.740
Okay, if there's probably more questions about that,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.460
they can come up for a future episode.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.700
But let's do another one.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.260
Answer another question.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.140
Or talk about stuff for a while

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.900
in a way that in no way answers the actual question.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.900
It depends how you wanna interpret it.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.420
Which one do you wanna do now?

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:02.410
Was there ever an episode talking about

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.570
what reference skills are needed

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:09.170
for a combined engineering team,

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.240
which I will now state,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.880
we don't want combined engineering teams,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.440
we want unified engineering teams.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.840
All right, and this was from Percy on the Slack channel.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.680
Was it?

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.500
Yep.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.780
Okay.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.120
And I asked him to clarify and he said,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.920
programming skills or testing skills or ops skills,

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.860
what's the bar?

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.960
Is there a must have

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.360
and it can be taught learned section.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.800
And data science.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.300
Like what are the skills the team needs

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.540
to be unified engineering?

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.300
So I don't think we had an episode talking about it.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.060
We did not, which is why I left the question here

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.180
for us to talk about.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.140
I did do.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.340
We're not gonna do a whole episode,

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.060
we're gonna do the next one to 30 minutes.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.700
I did do a blog on that.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.320
I don't think it answers it though.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.720
And yeah, the answer in a nutshell

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.780
is exactly from my experience,

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.770
you should flesh it out.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.210
From my experience,

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:12.270
it is programming, testing and ops skills.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.390
I think largely, yeah.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.470
You are making a jigsaw puzzle or soup.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.090
Yeah, so the one mistake I've seen people do

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.820
when they shift to this though,

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:28.820
is they re-interview testers

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.210
to make sure that they are coders

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.850
at the same level of dev.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:36.910
Yeah.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.070
And I think that's a mistake.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.790
I think it, no, to me it's infuriating when that happens.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:47.490
So the, what I propose is when you do this

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:53.230
is what you wanna do is you wanna have a balanced team.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.130
So when you do a unified team,

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.650
you're going to retrain that team.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.410
So this is another challenge.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:04.410
It's because every time I go do an Agile coaching session

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.460
to a dev team,

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.110
can you guess what the number one question is?

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.900
Do we have to do Agile?

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.830
No, it's-

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:17.670
Who does the testing?

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.510
I don't know.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.590
No, it's I'm a specialist in UI.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.550
So are you saying that I might have to work

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.470
on database code?

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.290
Really?

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.820
Yeah.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.660
And I go-

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.100
How are these people employed in 2018?

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.700
You know, I tried to understand.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.020
I would never have guessed that

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.290
cause I didn't know people like that still breathe.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.730
Oh, it's everywhere.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.010
Everyone is a special snowflake.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.630
I'm not.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:49.310
I am an unspecial muddy piece of slushy snow

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.670
that people have stepped on.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.440
Yeah, one might argue that you are a special snowflake

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.640
because you're not a special snowflake.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.280
That makes you special.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.810
Snowflake.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.560
Anyway.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.800
My sense on this one,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.550
or my guidance on this one is what you wanna do

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:18.470
is you wanna get the right skills on the team as a balance.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.710
Even if it means you have four dev specialists

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.580
and four test specialists, okay?

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.380
As a team, it's balanced.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.540
Then what you need to do is spend the next six months

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:34.020
forcing cross-pollination of knowledge.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.360
Actually, yeah, it's not a bad idea.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.440
Setting the examples I've done in the past,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.560
and this is one thing I did blog about,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.840
is so first and foremost,

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.960
I am fond of in this new team

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:55.110
putting the test manager as the one in charge,

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.540
not the dev manager.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.020
The test manager, from my experience,

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.320
is far more likely to understand

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.940
how to execute that cross-pollination.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.090
And I do think that's far more valuable in the long term.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:15.050
The next thing, so what I've done in the past, for example,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:20.590
is I've offered up when we do these unified engineering,

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.900
things I've done before is, all right,

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.530
you guys can pick the two or three testers

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:31.610
that come to your team.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:32.930
And you can pick whoever they want.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:36.490
And of course, they always pick the top two to three.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.250
But here's the criteria.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.410
You have six months, and in that six months,

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.470
your job is to turn them into a dev,

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.350
which means they need to be working on features,

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.070
they need to be doing bug fixes, okay?

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:54.060
Their job is to teach the rest of your dev

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.980
how to get this test stuff done.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.820
And at the end of that six months,

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.180
we are expecting that there is no difference

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.820
between any of these teams except for that,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.880
which is where experience makes a difference, right?

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.580
In terms of who does what activity, there's no difference.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.240
And then generally, I do a threat on that dev team.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.620
By the way, for the testers coming to your team,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:27.570
if they are not able to fulfill this bar,

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.590
we're gonna take them from you

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.490
and put them on a different team,

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:32.990
and you will still be accountable

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.470
for all the testing activity.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.960
This assumes you're starting from a place

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.020
where you have separate dev and test teams.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.540
Separate teams and merging.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.980
I think, probably, I'm wondering if the,

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.040
at this point, the majority of our teams

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.040
are not necessarily combined engineering,

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.780
but a lot of teams are set up in something

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.580
resembling an agile testing model

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.100
where they have a test specialist on the team,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.260
but they're like, they're managed by somebody else,

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.140
it's a matrix organization.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.660
But the difference is, I think,

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.980
is a lot of people I talk to, that tester,

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.680
even though this was not the intent

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.680
of describing an agile tester as Lisa and Janet did,

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.880
that tester ends up doing all the testing.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.120
I think Percy's situation is he's still

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.820
in the multi-discipline world.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.320
I just wanted to cross the bridge here

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.640
for a few of our other listeners

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.320
who are in a different world.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.980
Yeah, there's ways, there are ways that I've seen

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.200
ripping the band-aid succeed.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.320
No, I haven't.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.480
Not with this change.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.270
This is a tourniquet change.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.770
Again, so there are ways where I've seen it succeed.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:41.530
The better way is boiling the frog.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.890
For example, ripping the band-aid,

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:50.020
I've seen it succeed if you put the test guy in charge.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.320
Because they get it.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.160
Whereas the dev guy is trying to go,

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.480
how do I manage these useless tester guys?

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.070
And they do wacky things like hold a coding bar.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.830
I think the first thing you have to do

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.890
to make this work, whether or not you boil the frog

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.410
or rip the band-aid, is you have to realize

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.550
that in order to succeed, you have to create a culture

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.770
of knowledge across pollination.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:22.910
And the specialist culture can be rampant

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.150
across both disciplines.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.390
Anything you wanna add to this?

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.470
No, I think it's a good start

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.070
if Percy has more questions.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.070
I guess the answer to the question was no,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.910
there was never an episode on this.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.410
So everything else is just lovely elaboration.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.250
Right.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.130
Let's do another.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.680
Okay, you can pick it.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.040
Tony G. when I was in New York asked this question.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.160
I said we get it on a mailbag eventually,

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.020
and today's the day.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.590
Alan had a quick question regarding gathering data

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.000
and being data obsessed.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.640
During the design phase,

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.420
designers usually conduct mini user interviews

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.600
and gather multiple data points.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.070
And as a tester, I try to be involved.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.550
This has not been explicitly mentioned

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.250
in the podcasts or the Slack channels.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:07.290
From what I have gathered,

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.490
the focus on data gathering has been largely

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:12.290
once the item has been released into production.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.210
But I wonder how that compares to user data gathered

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.230
during the design phase.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.330
It is evident that the design phase data

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.290
is not actual data usage as in logs,

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.430
but it is useful data for a feedback loop

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:26.210
as nothing has been built yet.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.610
Just wondering if it's worth comparing this to

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.530
in regards to value of also being something

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:35.310
that adds to the definition of being data obsessed.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.990
My answer to him in mail was,

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.070
short answer, yeah, data is valuable.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.430
With a caveat that those designer customer meetings

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:45.230
often turn up what the customer wants versus needs.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.230
And it's in an area where our critical thinking

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.150
and questioning skills can help.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.990
But it can get some, in other words,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.590
it can get some discussion started,

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.830
but I'm not sure if it's how someone

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.870
who does data for a career would view that.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.860
So, first and foremost,

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.880
I'm thinking through, have we ever talked about it?

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.400
And then, I don't recall.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:14.400
And I will tell you that I won't necessarily go to it.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.320
Because as a data scientist, that type of data

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.280
is well known to be of very poor quality.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.280
Particularly for the reasons that Alan talks about.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.480
It's very well known phenomenon

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.820
that if you ask survey data,

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.820
or if you ask one on one questions,

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.660
humans are wired to subconsciously or consciously

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.760
sort of give the answer that the person wants to hear.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.320
And then recently we had a Twitter discussion

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.320
where one of the listeners had reread the lean startup

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.420
and noticed, did you see this?

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.260
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.140
And noticed, hey, there is a great alignment

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.050
between the lean startup and modern testing.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.010
Well, there's another alignment.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.570
The number of times we've mentioned

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.890
lean startup in this podcast.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.170
Yeah, right, so.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.970
I think I have quoted lean startup

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.130
in probably every presentation

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.080
I've given in the last five years.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.040
Yeah, it's, you know what, if there is like a,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.910
if there was a way to say,

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.470
like look, you don't have to listen to us babble,

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.790
just read the damn book.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.350
That's a big story.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.590
I think it's the same question.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.950
Like musicians get like asked, you know,

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.790
like if you're, you join a band

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.230
or you join a rock band and everyone in your band

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.710
listens to Led Zeppelin 20 hours a day,

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:46.050
your band's probably gonna sound

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.570
a little bit like Led Zeppelin.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:51.350
Right, it's gonna be on the influences list for sure.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.910
Lean startup is on our influences list.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.390
So if you wind it back, so is this data useful?

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:58.980
Yes.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.890
Is it everything you need?

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.730
No.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:04.530
Right.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:05.730
I think Tony knows that much,

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:09.050
but how, if you are data obsessed,

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.050
is that data important to you?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.720
So from a data scientist, no.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.560
Right.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.510
From an Agilist, you bet.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.730
Well put.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.530
You really can't do anything with this data

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:25.730
from a data science point of view.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:29.100
What you can do though is once you have both,

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.700
from an Agilist point of view,

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.140
one of the things, and even in NMT,

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:38.960
where we talk about lean thinking,

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.620
and one of the key things in lean thinking is,

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.400
in this context is look,

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.160
no matter how big your engineering team is,

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.440
it's a limited resource.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.680
And it is a damn crime if you spend engineering hours

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.700
on something that doesn't add value.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.610
The way I kind of look at these design phase discussions

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:06.830
is preliminary hypothesis generation.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:08.950
Right, so you have these designers that go out

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:12.550
and they talk to users and they're developing hypotheses.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.990
From a data science point of view,

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.070
I'm like hey, a list of hypotheses

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.310
that are already thought out for me, that's fantastic.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:23.030
That shrinks at least a day and a half of my time.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.310
But what we then would want to do,

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.670
or what I would want to do is have,

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:32.670
take those hypotheses, throw together a very quick prototype,

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.590
an MVP as it were, get it out there,

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.570
get it instrumented, and then see,

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:44.510
all right, what does usage say about these hypotheses?

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.390
And then do what's known as a pivot or persevere event

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:52.070
and say hey, do we have actual data

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:54.710
that aligns with the initial hypotheses

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.670
that warrants further investment

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.380
or should we change the direction we're going?

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.880
Yeah, so I think that data does have its use.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.420
It is, designers unfortunately,

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.940
their job is to pull together designs.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.020
So they don't have access to usage data

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.220
because they're trying to design something

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.820
that doesn't exist.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.900
But one thing that is good,

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.540
and we haven't praised just the value

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:28.730
of getting that early feedback from focus groups

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.690
or customers to get an idea

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.490
if you're heading in the right direction.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:33.770
He's already talking about it, he has,

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:35.490
but I think that's really important.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.210
You and I have both seen many products

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.890
of the what I call field of dream software development,

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.470
build it and they will come.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.270
Yeah, the one thing around dealing with designers

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.470
is along those lines.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.430
Right, a lot of these guys are very good at their craft.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:58.610
But again, a lot of the designers

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.090
and a lot of program management,

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:05.550
they're inflicted with Steve Jobs syndrome.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.870
And the key thing on this one is yeah,

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:11.990
that is useful, but it's gonna be really useful

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.710
when we get the prototypes run together

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.990
and can validate your hypotheses.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.830
Yes.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.950
The thing that I think is critical in this case

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:22.390
is to communicate what they've learned

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.430
and reframe it as hypotheses

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.630
if they aren't doing that already.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.230
That's the real challenge is a lot of these guys,

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.070
they've been in the industry forever.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:36.810
And my trigger is at this point in time,

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:40.450
anytime I have any conversation with anybody

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.410
and they're defending the point of view

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.410
with the phrase, I have been doing this for n years,

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:48.930
sadly at this point in time,

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.250
that is an almost immediate bit flip in my head.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.210
Yep, fully agree.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:59.360
Yeah, it is, there is no one that's perfect.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.320
Well, to me, it's to loop this back

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.820
into something else we talked about,

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.900
that ability to constantly learn and understand

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.140
that you have to constantly learn new things.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.860
You realize the number of years you've been doing it

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.980
doesn't matter because what you're doing

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.520
has to be new all the time.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.560
Another thing we've talked about,

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.940
like we reject the notion that predictive software

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:31.040
lifecycle models are good in today's world.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:31.880
Correct.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.000
We want adaptive.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.840
Yes, yes.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.160
And that starts at the beginning, even with the designers.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.920
Right, and there was a big thing,

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.800
Satya was hot about this a few years ago,

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.720
but it's been around a lot,

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.360
the fixed mindset versus the growth mindset.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.680
And we should all have the growth mindset.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.360
You absolutely have to have a growth mindset

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.320
to be in modern testing.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:56.320
You know, I like growth mindset and I like growth hacking,

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:59.190
but it's becoming buzzword.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.350
Yep, it's becoming, it's there.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:04.670
That ship is docked and boarded.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.370
I'm already working through, okay,

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:13.090
how do I come up with this and then

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.650
to explain the same concept?

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:20.930
The buzzword, once a phrase gets the buzzword set as,

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:26.380
you lose people attention on the message.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.500
Let's talk about shift right or not.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.260
I'll just throw that into the buzzword.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:35.100
No, we had a listener accuse us of,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:35.940
did you see this?

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.100
We had a listener accuse that accelerate

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.660
the achievement of shipable quality

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.420
is likely on its way to buzzword set as.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.220
It's too long and verbi to do that

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.380
and no one has shrunk it yet.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.060
Right, it's not there yet.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.060
Lots more I could throw in to talk about,

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.020
but I think we're out of time.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.460
We should probably wrap it up for today.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.900
Thanks everyone if you've listened this far.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.820
Hopefully you found something helpful in here.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.260
Thank you, Perji, Perji.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.780
Thank you, Perji, Tony and Rajiv for your questions today.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.380
If we didn't get to yours today,

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:10.380
we'll try and do it next time.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.220
Please re-ping us if needed.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.740
Always appreciated.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.060
I am once again still Alan.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.260
And I'm Britt.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.380
Or not Alan, have everyone with that.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.200
Okay.
