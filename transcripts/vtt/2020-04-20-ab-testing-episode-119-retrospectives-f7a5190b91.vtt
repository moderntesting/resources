00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.660
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.980
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.000
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hey everyone. We're back again. We're going

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.800
to do this thing again. The third COVID version of, Oh, Oh, Oh, it's episode one 19 with COVID

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.890
one. I did not plan that that popped into my head and now it's happening and it's a thing.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.630
COVID one 19. Yeah. It's Alan and Brent one 19. We are hoping that everyone is staying

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.910
healthy, staying sane. Can I say that? I think that I don't know about you, but I have

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.680
just, I have employees going stir crazy. I'm doing okay. I'm working more, which I know

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.240
is wrong. So I'm going to try and take, I'm going to try and not work at all over the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.910
weekend and we're going to see how that goes. But how about you? How are you holding up?

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.070
Holding up well, I think a future episode, by the way, we'll go into, I noticed a tweet

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:28.510
from you recently around, hi, my name's Alan. I am a stud when it comes to managing remote

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:38.270
teams. I'm paraphrasing and I have a remote employee starting on Monday. Great. So as,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.940
as you know, I think I should last time I'm in the middle of a whole bunch of COVID related

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.890
missions at Microsoft. I will say, as I also said last time, this new working from home

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.370
and all of the half hour meetings back to back, that's the one thing I don't understand why,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.930
but it is driving me crazy. It's just half hour back to back to back to back to back to back.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.700
It completely drains this introverts battery. Yeah, I end up exhausted at the end of the day.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.380
I'm having 10 to 12 meetings a day, sometimes a few more. Yeah, right now for the foreseeable

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:32.370
future, my Wednesdays are literally half hours back to back. So I guess that makes it 16. I have

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.980
blocked off lunch and I am now immediately declining. But Brent, it's really urgent.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.460
I don't care. Yeah, my Thursdays start at 5.30 in the morning. And luckily in the afternoon

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.860
yesterday, I had some time off, took the dog for a walk, try and get some recharge time in

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.140
because it's the same thing with me. I feel it really, the meetings are valuable. They're

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.380
not bad meetings to be in, but I'm just drained at the end of them. So I took some recharge time

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.300
to walk the dog. And then I was working on kind of this thing we were just talking about before

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.990
the call. And I pinged someone about getting some information about a project that had missed

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.930
estimate by quite a bit. I'm just gathering some retrospective data. He said, this is complicated.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.170
Can we have a call? So I did a call with him about from 5.30 to 6 at night. And I just was

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:38.100
ready to drink and curl up into a ball at the end. Yeah, I get that. So as you know, the COVID

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.220
practices continue to sort of have a domino effect. I don't have anything relating to

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:57.660
data, but I'm barely certain that that effect is just like COVID. It started off with sort of an

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.780
exponential growth curve. I think the domino effect is now starting to have an exponential

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.460
growth curve. Again, I have not looked at that data at all. But companies are laying off,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:18.940
companies are furloughing. Right now, Microsoft as we get closer and closer to the end of our fiscal

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:30.610
year, fiscal year is where we get new budget. So the positions, what we used to call, or what

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.970
you used to call, I still do, the RECs, the open head count.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.610
That may be an industry-wide term, but go on.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.260
Okay, the open head count is rapidly shifting. Microsoft is building a new data center in

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.980
Atlanta. We already have four folks there. I'm serving as an active manager for that team.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.220
And just came down this week that the open manager position we had for that one

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:18.380
is at severe risk. So there is a non-trivial chance that I will shortly be in a position

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.340
where half of my team is on opposite sides of the United States.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.860
You're so funny.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.220
Yeah.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.010
My team lives 10 hours away. Half of them do.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.860
By walking, driving, flying?

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.940
10-hour time zone difference.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.700
Oh, gotcha.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.540
Yeah. Okay. Great. So for me, what seems like

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.380
challenging difficulty, you're like, I dream of your situation, nevertheless.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.180
Yeah, that's why I love it.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.780
As previously stated, you're a master of managing.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.820
I want to come back to that. This is why I love Fridays, because the folks in Europe don't

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.380
generally want to have late afternoon or early evening meetings on Fridays, so I get a little

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.860
extra time. A few fewer meetings on Fridays. It's great. A couple things to mention. I'm a master,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.020
but here's something interesting that happened with my latest rec. See how I use that lingo?

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.170
I had a plan to, from the beginning, the person I'm talking about, and I'll give you

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.890
the name in a second, is the plan all along was then to work fully remote, to not be part

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.810
of an office, to work from their home the entire time. There were a few like, I don't know,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.010
but my boss is really supportive, and we made it happen. I was able to get a rec approved by

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:50.210
finance, get all the leveling and pay done, all remote, which is great. What will be cool is,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.850
he'll onboard remotely. Then at some point, when everybody goes back to the office,

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.970
he'll just stay at home and people won't notice that he's never coming to an office. I think

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:09.940
it's going to work out very well. In your travels around the internet, I'm sure this is the name,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.420
at least some of our listeners have mentioned. I can bring this up because this won't get out

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.420
until after he starts, but do you know if you come across Noah Sussman?

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.710
Yes.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.750
So Noah is my new hire starting on Monday.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.950
Nice.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.540
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.660
Is Noah one of the three?

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.820
Noah's not one of the three, but Noah definitely could be. I don't require it of my employees.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:40.580
I have a handful of my employees hang out among the three, or former employees in some cases,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.460
but he's going to do some great things and take a lot of load and pressure off of me,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.660
which is going to be great. I'm pretty darn excited. Then I have a skip level also starting

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.700
in San Francisco working remotely on Monday. So my team is doubtful. And we,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.780
unlike Microsoft, the fiscal year for us actually matches the calendar year.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:07.920
So I am done with hiring until probably until 2021.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.470
Jay, makes a lot of sense. All right.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.550
So you had...

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.670
I do. I do. And I'm going to segue. I'm going to segue.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.070
I was going to say you did a brilliant segue 10 minutes ago.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.430
I know. And I'm going to re segue with a twist.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:33.490
So I think I mentioned, yeah, I'm going to do this. I mentioned 10 minutes ago, it seems that

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.010
it's easy to follow up on bugs and things that go wrong for a retrospective.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:48.590
It's also good to look at things like delays in delivery and do not a deep,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.470
necessarily deep dive into what went well, what went wrong.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:09:03.390
But what I found is taking time to reflect and to learn is so important. And I think that,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:15.780
no, I know that a organization that emphasizes learning and improvement is an organization

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.460
that's going to predictably deliver high quality, reliable software.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.470
From my experience, it's been experience I've observed. I'm pretty strong around that point.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:36.190
Yet, yet. I don't know that teams in general take advantage of the retrospective as much

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:43.470
as they could. And one thing I'm thinking of is at the end of this COVID thing,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.980
well, maybe it'll never end. But when we start going back to work,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:54.020
I think there are some things we should learn from our experiences and everyone working from

00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:00.740
home and distributed work that may actually help us going forward back in the workspace.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:09.460
And what makes me sad a little bit is that I don't know if a lot of teams or organizations

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.420
will take the time to reflect on what went well, what didn't go well, and the whole working from

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:22.740
home, everyone working from home thing, and then apply that going forward. So the teams that will,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:28.820
there is a huge opportunity for teams to reflect on this time through something like a retrospective

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:34.900
in order to make some lasting change in their organization. So with all that long intro,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.220
I thought it would be good for us to talk about the importance and the value and some tips and

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:45.060
tricks for retrospectives for a little bit here today. There's my intro. Give me your thoughts.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:53.490
So I do know, for example, my, my skill level manager is planning on talking about this

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:05.840
and doing something here. Behavioral psychology, like, for example, one of the things that we

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:13.920
know of human behavior is that if you repeat a pattern for around 90 days, it becomes a new

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.400
part of your structure. And right now, I think we're about halfway through the 90 day period,

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:30.290
at least I am. Then my anchors of this is, is both my wife and I celebrated our 50th this year.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:38.290
We were actually able to go to a fancy resort. I was COVID-19 up for my 50th.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.800
Happy birthday, Brent.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:48.720
Oh yeah. I mean, it's, it's more than a month delayed, but I appreciate the sentiment out.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:55.200
And one quick shout out to my kid who is having his 16th birthday today in COVID isolation.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:03.460
Yeah, that sucks. Yeah. I mean, wish him happy birthday, but he's got my empathy.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:11.730
Hey, you're old enough to drive, but you have to stay home. Sucks to be you kid.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:20.940
Now, yeah, one of my employees just, just shared that they're at 20 weeks and they're about to

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:27.820
have their first kid. And of course the wife is, is like, okay, is my mom even going to be able to

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:33.020
come and visit? Oh my God. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And anyway,

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:40.240
that's, this is the retrospective show. So yeah, there's going to be a lot of learnings on that

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:49.150
front. And obviously learning is easier if it's positively reinforced by action from the top

00:12:49.150 --> 00:13:00.430
down, but it's not necessarily necessary. I do find the retrospective is in fact,

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:08.850
the most important meeting of the week. But one of the anti-patterns that, that often takes a

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:21.460
lot of time to weed out of the team is it's not a post-mortem. It's, it's your job is to

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:37.970
leverage hindsight and find practical changes that you should implement now. Yes. Yeah. So as you know,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:45.890
I do a lot of agile coaching, or at least I did. It's not so much anymore. It's not a new thing as

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:54.400
it once was in Microsoft. So I have a whole deck. I have a whole different variant of Klonbon

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.900
that I've put together. And I have a slide on, on this in that deck. So I don't know where you

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:06.740
want to go here, but I'm, I'm ready to talk about things. Okay. I want to push back on one thing

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.660
and elaborate a little bit and see where things go. One is the line I give my teams and the teams

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:20.860
I work with is the retrospective is the second most important meeting of the week, only behind

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.220
the one-on-one with your manager. No, one-on-ones with your manager are useless. What are you

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:34.140
talking about? All right. If you had said stand up, you know, I might have a viable argument.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.780
No, I wouldn't. I don't even care if you do stand up. Just do the damn retro. And the retro might tell

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:44.860
you you have to do stand up. And of course, the, I do want to point out that the people look at the

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.860
manifesto for those four statements, this, over this, this, over this, blah, blah, blah. But there

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:57.180
are a whole crap ton of agile principles. And one of those is the one that says at regular intervals,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.060
the team reflects on how to become more effective and then tunes and adjust its behavior

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:08.750
accordingly. And it is often neglected and I just don't get it. I just don't get it.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:18.190
Oh, and I do. It's, it's again, over and over. What I've, what I've seen is the pattern is

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:26.110
people use it as a way to get the team together and have a post-mortem.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:34.610
Yeah. And, and, and that is maybe 25% of the value.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.780
Maybe, maybe. And do you remember the old days of Microsoft when we worked on these products that

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:47.580
took three to five years to make. And at the end, uh, there would be no reflection on what went

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.420
wrong, but we would celebrate what went well by having a big expensive party.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:16:01.150
Oh, I would often be in post-mortems as well. Um, but because it's a post-mortem after three years,

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:10.190
right? We would only talk about, um, uh, what was top of everyone's mind, which is generally,

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:16.110
you know, whatever caused the, the slip. Yeah. And in the last month.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.710
And I remember the post-mortems, uh, just about every single post-mortem,

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:25.550
I went to at Microsoft and these are all far in the past were, uh, they came out with a big,

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:31.870
long list of things that didn't go well. And maybe some things that went well, I don't remember,

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.510
but I do remember that that list was then quickly forgotten and nothing ever done with it.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.910
And the key, the key to a retro is I, and I think you and I are highly aligned on this is

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.950
take the time to reflect, celebrate some things that went well, find some things that didn't go

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:55.150
well, and then come out with one or two or maybe three at the most action items, things that are

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.230
going to happen. And those are assigned immediately. Those have owners, those are done. And what

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:07.300
happens as a team gets into the habit of this is very often those things that were

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:14.580
complaints in one week or one retro, and they get action items assigned and someone deals with them,

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.380
they become the thing you celebrate as a victory or something that's worth celebrating

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.130
in the following retrospective. When you are a team, if you're having these weekly,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.570
even if you're having these every other week, I would not go any less frequent than that.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.970
And you say you just pick one thing to improve and it happens throughout the year.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:40.450
You've made 25 small improvements throughout the year, which is a huge difference on a team.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.930
And again, going back to what I said earlier, embracing learning and improvement. This is

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.170
in the quality culture transition guide, but embracing learning and improvement is a key

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:55.150
aspect of building your quality culture. Yes, absolutely. Now the

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.390
things to disagree on. I think we're highly aligned here.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.910
Yeah, but here I think our intent, did you want to argue about?

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.990
No, no, no, but I'm going to ask this. How do you get teams to do retro if they're not doing

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.830
them? Because we agree they're super important. And I think we also agree not enough teams do

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:18.100
them. How do you get teams to do them? So normally when I'm doing it, it's because

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:25.790
they've come to me and they've asked me to teach them the system. And what I do,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:32.990
generally as part of that, when I sign up is I tell them, I am actually going to run

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:41.870
their retrospective. I run their, their stand up for the next month. And I run retrospective for

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:50.110
the next two months, although not quite. So I will run it for the next, I will run their

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:59.230
retrospective for the month that I'm running stand up. And, but during that time, we have

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:05.950
identified, I have identified who is going to take point on running retrospective when I depart.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:13.040
In that second month, we shift over to that person doing it. And I'm in the room and I'm

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:23.710
coaching them. Right. So initially, it's very structured, because I want them to understand

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:34.900
the, the right questions to ask, and how to, how to look at the problem. So I, the way I found

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:42.610
most successful is I basically control it. I come in and I say, this is what you're going to do.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:49.410
These are the questions we're going to ask. And we're going to keep doing it until, until you were

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:58.290
able to see the positive impact. It works very well. For example, if, if you have sprints that are

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.410
in with that timeline, I just mentioned, it's a team you're talking about is either shifting to

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:11.520
compound, which is normally what I recommend, or, or at least have a, a small sprint cycle. Right.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.640
If they don't have a small sprint cycle, then that's the first thing I do is change that.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:25.180
Yeah. I think that I have a slightly different approach, but which people were talking about

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:31.490
is I often start with a less formal approach. I often, so we talk a lot about velocity and

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.290
predictability. You and I have talked about a little bit offline. I think we talked the last

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:42.130
episode about velocity. One of the things that I have been telling the teams and one, one wonderful

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:48.210
thing about our organization is, is full one I, I pick on them, but they're a high performing org.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:56.780
I just can spot the areas to improve, maybe better than some. So when I talk about velocity

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:02.620
and delivery velocity and predictability, the thing I bring up is it's not about coding faster.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.140
It's about recognizing where the delays are in the system and finding ways to mitigate or

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.580
eliminate those. Yes. And those delays can be anything from waiting for a code review to

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.020
something taking too long in the build system to waiting for legal to sign off on something.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:25.660
It's an endless list, but here is the key. So the next step in the plan or the thing

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.940
now that the org recognizes, yeah, you're right, Alan, it's the delays. It's not,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.340
those are the things that messes up. We never thought about them before. Oh, so now you're

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:40.620
thinking about them. And then I do often for teams that aren't doing retros, the stealth retro,

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.420
where maybe it's, I mean, they may want to meet with me and talk about, hey, Alan,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.900
what are some ways you think we can do improve our velocity or what are some ways you think we

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:57.340
can improve quality? And without even being formal, I may just in a meeting with them,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.620
ask some questions like, what do you think is going well in regards to this? And we'll list

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.340
some things on the board or in some these days in virtual notes. And then I say, well, what

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:12.880
are some things that aren't going well? And we'll take some more notes on that. Are there a

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.280
couple of things we can do about it right away that would make a difference? Yeah, yeah. Then

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.480
we do those things and then I may cap it off. We should have another meeting like this in next

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.280
week or the week after. Yeah, that's a good idea. And then all of a sudden we're doing retros.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.760
Oh, yeah. Stealth right through. Love the term. Yeah.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:42.000
Because there are, we have the culture of autonomy in our organization is so strong.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.800
People want to be independent and make their own choices and they're really good at it.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.480
But what it does is when you have that culture, it can make a little bit of aversion to things

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:59.440
sound like process. So I have to be very careful of that because I want to, to use my Heffetz quote

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:06.720
yet again, disappoint people at a level they can absorb. So I find that going into that

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:13.860
discussion, if they don't feel like it's a air quote processing thing, I end up having a lot more

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.340
success. So I ended up doing stealth retros quite a bit. And some teams are actually a little farther

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:24.020
along. They actually realize the value of them and do them much better and on their own.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:32.900
That's a worthy discussion point. That's an interesting concept. I am thinking,

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.700
well, I don't want to do that right now on the podcast, but it might be something we're

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:49.070
talking about later because I do have something very process laden. And I have now mastered when

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:58.100
people come in with, with sort of their process, both a bit firmly entrenched in the on position.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:05.780
I have come up with all kinds of ways to break down that wall. But as we know, the more you can

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:12.500
boil the frog and make him think it was their idea in the first place, the more sustainable it is.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:20.260
Yeah. Yeah. And I think this just points out that you need to recognize the context of the team

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.460
you're dealing with. For some teams, you can say, you know what, let's have a retrospective on this.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.020
They go, yeah, let's do that. But you know your teams, you know, the teams you're working with,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.700
whether it's the team you're on, which is probably true for most of you, or if you're

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:37.360
in a role more like mine, where your team is 50 different teams around that organization

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:44.880
is finding the way that will work for that team. Because honestly, what we want to do is get every

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.960
team to embrace the value of reflecting on the work they've done and figure out what have a

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.240
little mini celebration for us. Well, well, and then also figure out where improvements can be

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:04.990
made. We retro everything. So is it worthwhile for me to sort of try to describe at a high level

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:12.430
what my process is? Yeah, I think everybody knows Alan is the loose and wing it, foot loose and

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:18.510
fancy free retro. And one thing is we do team retros for project work. And then also anytime

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:23.470
there's an opportunity for learning, our org is pretty good about, hey, yeah, let's retro that.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.540
We just did a promotion cycle. We're doing it. We do promotion panels and we had multiple

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.580
retros on how the panels work so we can get them even better next time. There's a series of meetings

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.700
we have. We'll go into details and we took some time to have retros on those to figure out what's

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:44.940
going well to try and improve those. So our org is pretty good at that. But as good as we are

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.900
at retrowing some things, some things we forget to, that's where I poke in sometimes with the

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.380
self retro, just to make sure everyone is embracing that learning culture. So yeah,

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.100
that is my recap. Go on to the little more Brenta fied version of the retro.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:11.170
Sure. It's interesting on your recap, because every so often I will represent my deck around

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:18.610
the system to my own team. It's maybe about once a year. And it's fascinating because

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:27.570
I'm able to very clearly see solutions that in the moment I don't see. And that's because

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:34.050
I'm in the weeds. And so this deck has been, or the deck that I do has been fascinating to me,

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:43.810
because it's sort of the completely buried and in fire drills, subjective Brent being talked to

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:52.210
by five years ago, objective Brent. And then I'm like, Oh yeah, I should go back to that. I can

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:57.650
see where I diverge and got in the weeds. Anyway, so when retrospectives at a high level,

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:05.420
I generally do two different types. Here, I'll just talk about what I call the weekly

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:12.620
retrospective. If there's interest, we can talk about the quarterly one as well.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:21.220
The weekly, the problem I find with the weekly retrospective is generally very tactical. So

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:29.220
you generally see people talking about, you know, what, what could have improved this particular

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:36.050
feature of this particular story or this particular fill in the blank on your own tactical

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:42.190
thing. And it's useful in my experience to have something quarterly that sort of

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:49.890
goes up the stack and tries to identify patterns. And you can search it on the internet for that.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:59.090
It's called the starfish model retrospective. I find that very handy. The other thing I've done

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:06.050
for the weekly retrospective is in order to make it slip side, it's just not, you know,

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:13.940
I get together time. I started off with a goal and the goal of the retrospective is

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:21.300
by the end of the retrospective, we should have identified two actionable things

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:30.270
for two categories that we will immediately implement. And the categories are celebrate and

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:36.190
change. What are two things based on what we learned today that we should change immediately

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.190
and what are two things that we should celebrate immediately. And that's the goal.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:46.540
That's the goal I put in place for retrospective so that it's not just to talk fast. Okay.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:58.700
A couple of changes that I do. We generally will talk about tickets that are perceived as

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:07.500
problematic. So that this could be tickets, stories, again, and we do a Kanban style

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:14.980
so we will specifically target the ones that were over, that were delivered over the SLA.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:21.380
But you could also do overestimate. For those who don't understand the difference in Kanban,

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:34.500
typically you want to target tickets that you spend less than a amount of time planning on this.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:42.340
You really just want confidence that you can complete it in two weeks or less. And if you can,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:50.540
then great. Don't spend the time estimating. So for us, the SLA will be two weeks for initial

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:57.340
start. And then if it goes over, we want to talk about those. Now, here's one first paradigm shift

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:03.660
that we kind of do is we want retrospective to be focused on it's a team sport. Okay.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:12.080
But that's generally not how tickets are executed unless you're in a place that's

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:21.440
XP and everyone mobs or pair programs. Generally, you have a single person that was on that delay.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.720
Now, the one of first perspective is when we talk about it, we're going to assume that

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:36.750
that person was perfect in every single way. And that the reason why there was delay in that ticket

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:45.330
was due to the other members of the team. What this does over time is it gets people to realize

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:52.530
how they in fact could have detected earlier that this ticket was late or was about to be late and

00:30:52.530 --> 00:31:01.330
how they could have come in, shared knowledge, etc. I see you nodding in the camera. Do you wish

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:08.450
to interject? Nope, I'm with you. All right. The other thing I tried to do is get them to identify

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:21.100
waste. Waste, waste tickets, or delay. These are the biggest causes from my experience,

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:33.070
the biggest causes of why it was late. My favorite thing is something I picked up from Eric Reese.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:39.710
And that is if you can identify a waste ticket, and I'll give you a little clue about that later.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:46.100
Actually, let me talk about waste ticket. So if you want to identify if it's a waste ticket,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:56.340
you first go, value I got from the ticket, would I do more of it if I could? If the answer is yes,

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:04.580
then that is probably value. Now, let's assume it's customer value in this case. But if you said,

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:11.710
no, I would not do more of it if I could, then you ask, can I do less of it? And if the answer

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:17.870
is no, that's a cost. If you can't do less of it, then that's just a cost of doing business.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:22.290
Like, for example, monitoring. Would you do more monitoring if you could?

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:30.660
A lot of times the answer is no. But can you do less of it? Also, no. Right. So,

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:41.380
monitoring, writing monitoring or things of that sort is often just a cost of running a service,

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:47.220
doing a business. I like this framing, and I may stick this into even a stealth retro,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:53.700
but it's a way it prompts the right questioning around the tasks the team is working on. So

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.260
that's really valuable. Yep. Cool. And then once you identify it's a waste ticket,

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.500
and I'm going to try to finish the rest of this in maybe three minutes,

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:10.530
it once you identify the waste ticket, then the real critical thing is to talk about is what

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:19.010
could the team had done differently to come to the same conclusion much sooner. And that

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:25.150
is very valuable. Like we've talked over and over again around the Eric Ries scenario.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:34.540
I find it encouraging people to practice that muscle and come up with creative ways that

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:42.700
they could have realized that they were onion peeling something that would ultimately have no

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:49.700
value sooner than we can close on those things faster and get them onto something more valuable.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:58.420
So learning to identify that you're working on a waste ticket right now is just a fantastic

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:04.820
muscle to build. Once people get good at that, then you got to teach them how to identify delay.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:13.010
And I normally will tell people, hey, from my experience, I have there's four big causes of delay.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:20.130
And number one, dependency mismanagement. Like you started a ticket, you did not realize you

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:28.420
had a dependency, or you did not realize your dependency wasn't going to land in time. And you

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.940
sat there waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for your dependency to clear

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:39.940
so that you could move forward. If you can identify these things and the next system I'll

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:47.060
talk about, we'll do it. I don't know if I'll do it justice sometime. What I tell people is don't

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:55.040
start the work until you are sure the dependency is cleared. Obviously, sometimes you miss

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.880
dependencies. And that's important in the retrospective to learn from so that the next

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.040
time, but don't start the work until you have the dependency cleared. Do not try to do things

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.400
in parallel with a dependent team is my best advice. Multitasking, that's another one.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:15.100
I'm smiling because I've been having so many discussions around. These aren't part of an

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:21.780
official, even one of my stealth retros, but I work a lot with our teams on velocity and

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:26.260
predictability. And these are the things that come up all the time. Dependencies.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.460
Multitasking is another one. Too many things at once. That's a huge problem in our orgs.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:39.300
And yeah, it is, yes. This is not what I'm nodding at. These are things that you've applied your

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.820
scientific, your processes to, but it's the truth everywhere.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:54.690
Yes. Another one is a bad definition of done during the design phase. People realizing that

00:35:54.690 --> 00:36:02.370
they didn't describe it well enough, or they described it in a way that was sort of activity

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:07.250
driven. Same. Yeah. And then last.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:14.610
I feel like I could go into any rando org in the world and give some generic blueprinted

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.170
advice around those things. And of course, help people reach them and that's it. That's all I

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:25.410
have to do. And then knowledge bottlenecks is the other major one. It's essentially you have

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:32.770
one person on the team that knows everything that is necessary for that story to move forward.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:39.150
Because you've read the Phoenix project, that's Brent, not that Brent, the other Brent.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:46.110
Not me. Yeah. At some point in time, I will probably send a mail to an author and

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:54.270
express my emotion around their choice of names. It's all coincidental. Although the three

00:36:54.270 --> 00:37:01.070
definitely seem to enjoy that that person's name is Brent. I less so. So there is a tool.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:07.070
And I'm definitely not going to be able to do this justice in the time we have remaining today,

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:15.950
but the it's called a value stream map. And this is something that I find very fascinating,

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:25.310
very enlightening. And what we do is so imagine the timeline for that particular ticket. And what

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:35.760
you do is you ask the person to just draw a line. And the line is along the timeline. And the line

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:44.350
just goes up or down. And it's just a zero or one if you think about any sort of graph that you see.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:51.970
Okay. The x-axis, it are dates. And you say, all right. So when did you start? And they say,

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:58.740
this date. Great. Did you start now? How many days in a row were you actively working on it?

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:06.930
On that date? And actively working on it. And you draw a line in that up position for those

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:14.370
number of days. And then when they were stalled and delayed, you move it, you move the line

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:20.800
down and you say, how many days were you delayed on that one? And then up, down, up, down.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.880
Alan, am I describing this well so far?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.080
Yep. I'm quite familiar with the value stream map. And yes.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:36.880
All right. Then what you do is you have the, you first look at the downs. That's where the delays

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:43.520
were occurring. And you have a, you look at the biggest one in that ticket and you say, okay,

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:50.240
what could we have done to just eliminate that delay? Like what were you doing there? What

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.880
were you waiting on? What could we have done to eliminate that, that particular delay? How

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.990
could we have gotten this ticket complete without that delay? Sometimes you'll find

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:08.270
tickets that don't have big delays or the delays or weekends. The weekend ones, I definitely

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:15.310
encourage just ignoring those. The, then if you see, okay, well, you see a big chunk where they

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:20.850
were working actively, say for seven days. Then, then you start going, okay, what could we have

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:26.610
done to, to shrink that? How could we have shared knowledge with you proactively? There are many

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:32.530
times where I find the person because there was a knowledge bottleneck. They spent their time,

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:39.410
three days of their cycle, actively learning what could have been answered in five minutes by that,

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:45.650
the knowledge bottleneck. And then you start calling out, oh, you know what, this,

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:50.610
this information is really important. Maybe what we need to do is have knowledge bottleneck,

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:59.500
spend an hour recording a presentation so that others can review it instead of, you know, going

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:06.700
through this one-off process. And so that allows people to sort of go through it tactically

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:14.480
and then identify additional sort of places to learn. Now, what I found is if you do this sort

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:23.230
of tactical thing over and over again, the common, I keep using the tactical, the common patterns

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:29.150
for the day-to-day job that is slowing them down become very clear. And again, they have the goal of

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:38.960
identifying two celebrates and two changes. And when you get them through these sort of paradigm

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:45.040
shifts, they start being very productive and identifying what they themselves,

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:51.040
I will say, again, one of the key ones that I've done on this one is the person who was

00:40:51.040 --> 00:41:00.910
owning the ticket is in retrospective by definition, faultless. You want to encourage the, you want,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:08.640
without using the word blame the team, you want to blame the team and basically say, no, no,

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:14.560
this guy did everything. They were perfect. They are a five-star engineer. They did everything that

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.880
they could have given the information. The reason why it fell down is you people didn't help him in

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:26.720
a timely fashion. Now let's figure out what we could have done so we don't do that next week.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.880
So one of the, I'm going to, there's this concept referred to often psychological safety,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.880
is this culture of no blame. And when I run more official, it's usually incident retro,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.020
something we were doing a retrospective, not just from work on tickets, but here's something

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:51.140
that went wrong, whether it's in a delivery or in a customer impacting incident. And we want to

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.480
embrace the learning opportunity. And I typically lead these for teams across the organization.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.800
And I always lead that discussion by saying, by reminding the team and they get it now.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:09.420
And I say something like this, thanks for your time and coming today. Appreciate it. I want to

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:15.820
remind everybody, this is not about blame. This is, if it's anybody's fault, it's my fault. And

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:22.540
I want to have a discussion to figure out what we can do to our environment to make it less likely

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:28.900
that a problem like this could happen in the future. Some variation of that, because it

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:34.940
really is about creating the systems and environments and culture where the mistakes

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.700
that we have made in the past are much more difficult to make in the future.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:45.500
We even, for our incidents, we even, our production incidents, we even track a large bucket.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.260
We have a lot of different buckets for the category of an incident, but we sort of break

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:54.860
them down into, we messed up, somebody else messed up and we should have known better.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:00.860
And the should have known better category is the things that where we had a similar incident

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:07.180
in the past and we failed to make the right adjustments to the system to stop that from

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:13.500
happening. The other angle, so I liked that. There's a couple of pivots that I will do is

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:19.900
what I will specifically call out again, that the person who was running the ticket

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:33.580
was perfect. They did, we will have retrospective under the assumption that this person did

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:42.700
everything correct under the context that they were in. I do, I shift back and forth

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:52.940
before between whether I use the B word or not, but I will always reinforce that that person was

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:59.860
perfect. And the other angle on that one is every so often that person will step up and they will

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:08.140
say, I am 100% at fault. I stop that. I prevent that. I disallow it. But there's other tricks

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:16.700
as well. So, so for example, if for some reason, we see that the ticket was actually delayed in the

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:24.860
design phase, then what I will do is I will not ask the person who owned the ticket any question

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:32.620
about that. I will ask who were the design reviewers and I will ask them, Hey, what do

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:36.140
you think you could have done to detect this? What do you think you could have done

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:44.460
to ask the right question sooner? Things along those lines, because I try to reinforce, Hey,

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:51.740
our job, the reason why we do design reviews is that we assume that the person who designed it

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:57.410
did something wrong, right? And in that design phase, they had some invalid assumption, right?

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:05.250
And so your job is to be the objective reviewer and go, Okay, what did they miss? And same thing.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:13.070
If it's, if it's, for example, based off of a code review, Hey, how come how, what do we think we

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:18.990
could have done so that the code reviewers could have observed this sooner? But I always try to

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:27.010
protect. I don't want the discussion to be around the owner. I want the discussion to be around the

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:34.690
team and how the team could have detected this is a ticket or a person in trouble and come in and

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:41.810
give them the information that they need at that time. Right. This is the retrospective I found

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:50.430
is one of the more valuable techniques to block this, this phenomenon of it's a, that sounds like

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.380
your problem, not mine. Eric, I'm done babbling on that one.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:03.710
All right. Short takeaway is retro's good. Do them, figure out what works for you and your team.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:09.150
You could do it from the lightweight stuff retro all the way to really digging in. I love the

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:13.950
questions you have and I want to find a way to incorporate some of those into the, both the

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:20.270
stealth and the expected, I call them retros that my team does. Yep. Because we're focusing a lot

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:26.430
on finding delays in the system. I've got the team to realize that's really important. So I will use

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:32.270
some of your techniques and I hope the listeners have learned some things they can try to.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:39.630
Me too. All right, man. So we are done. I think, do you have anything else? Any closing words,

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:46.110
any fancy things to say? Be safe, I guess. Yeah, I guess so. All right. I feel like a

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:51.630
news anchor that's supposed to say some sort of sign off catchphrase. Yeah, we don't really have

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:58.030
one. So thanks for listening yet again. We'll talk to you all soon. Bye.
