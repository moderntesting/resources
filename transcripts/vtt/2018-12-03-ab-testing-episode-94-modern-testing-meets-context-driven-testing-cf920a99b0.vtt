00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.240
A B. Test

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.400
The Modern Testing Podcast.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.940
I am mindless agile robot.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.320
I must iterate.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.880
As we talk about software engineering, software quality,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.500
leadership, and whatever else comes to mind.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.280
Now on with the show.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.120
Hey, we're back.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.920
Howdy everyone.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.880
Hey, welcome to another episode of A B testing.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.680
This is what I thought when I drove to work this morning,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.920
95 that it is not in this episode 94.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.440
Nope. 95 is our infamous.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200
End of the year extravaganza.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.040
Right.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.480
Where we try and come up with predictions

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.200
and you know, predicting things is hard,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.360
especially about the future.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.220
We'll also review some of the things we liked and loved

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.430
about 2018.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.310
I don't know if you saw my tweet.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.670
Did I just tweet this?

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.150
I put it in our channel as well.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.070
You slacked it.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.350
I tweeted it and slacked it in one of the three.slack.com.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.990
Do you slack it?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.670
I'm going to say I slacked it.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.990
I was searching for, I was actually looking for something.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.950
It was based on a conversation we had

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.430
where I was trying to find my strength finder information.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.270
Did you?

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.690
And I did find it because it's weird.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.790
Probably one of the only accounts I have left,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.390
I'll probably keep discovering more,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.450
where it used my Microsoft email address as the login.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.830
So luckily I remember my password

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.990
because there was no way I was getting the password

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.830
with the email that to me.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.910
Did you, oh, so you didn't do the blog search,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.590
I suggest, because you do your blog on it.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.630
And I did the blog search.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.270
I did not find a blog on it.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.150
I don't think I blogged it.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.610
So while you remember that,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.230
but what I did find interestingly,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.030
interestingly it was what I found

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.910
is some predictions I made about trends

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.670
in software testing in 2014.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
And I made it as a result of someone saying,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.790
these are the trends.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.990
I thought, these aren't trends.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.830
These are established things.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.630
Like one of the trends was mobile testing.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.070
It's like, what the heck?

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.270
Oddly, you can go find my tweets

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.430
because I've forgotten what the things are.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.710
But you posted it on.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.030
I did post it on Twitter.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.370
20, no, 2014 was when I think the date.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.430
Yes, it was mid 2014.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.950
So three and a half years ago.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.610
And it ended up being a lot of things

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.490
that we're seeing a lot of,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.370
I was actually right for once.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.510
But I don't think it was a tough stretch.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.350
It was stuff.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.170
No, this is.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.990
It was stuff we had been talking about.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.950
Even before we, at that point,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.070
I don't think we had named modern testing.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.910
No, no, no.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030
But we had talked about it indirectly

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.070
because we had talked about our struggles

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.590
with traditional testing.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.790
We just hadn't come up with the opposite term yet.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.630
But anyway.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.910
We had to come up with names.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.830
It was interesting to look at.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.790
It was funny, I got a comment, a fresh comment

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.150
based on the tweet from someone who didn't realize

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.670
it was three and a half years old.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.870
It said, oh, these are good.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.230
Some other trends I see are blah and blah.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.310
I think you missed the point.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.150
Yeah.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.730
Time out.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.570
Time out.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.650
Timing.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.030
You were gonna get me a cup of coffee.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.870
No, it's cool.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.230
It's cool, I'm just saying.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.630
I'm just saying.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.030
I was.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.630
I epically failed the coffee.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.470
Anyway, go on.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.880
I don't know, five, six years ago.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.480
Not Whitaker, so this is a story about Whitaker.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.360
Not his current.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.320
Matt Whitaker, the Ace Attorney General.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.160
No, James Whitaker.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.480
Oh, James Whitaker.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.960
Not his latest book on stories,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.940
but I think the tours one.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.780
Yes.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.380
What was the name of that book?

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.580
I think it was called Exploratory Testing.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.940
Oh, right.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.340
Mainly to piss off some folks.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.180
Yeah.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.580
Successfully done, I might say.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.020
And yeah, that was funny.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.180
I wrote the forward for that book, by the way.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.140
Did you?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.580
That's the best part of the book.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.420
The one thing.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.260
Arguably.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.960
So it was one of the last few times

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.960
James had a regularly scheduled lunch with me.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.520
And it may be possible that I pissed him off

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.760
on my comments on this one.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.870
But I'm like, James, this book

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.870
is exactly the same as How to Break Software,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.590
except with this tour spin on it.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.950
And one of the things that I, yeah,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.460
he didn't appreciate that comment,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.420
but he did accept it.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.340
And he's like, dude, you know what?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.700
Sometimes you just repackage the same thing.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.830
And I'm like, I think about that a lot on MT

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.150
and I think it's related to your stuff.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.150
I think MT is going to be contextually relevant

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.040
for much longer than either you and I have patience for.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.310
Right, I think it'll still be relevant

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.110
potentially five years from now.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.950
Oh, I think it's-

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.470
But if you and I are still talking about it

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.950
five years from now, we either came up

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.390
with something really fresh that excites us

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.670
or this podcast is gonna be super boring.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.070
Going to be, continue to be.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.470
No, this is a relative discussion.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.170
A couple stories, we do have one topic today, one,

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.730
but a couple stories which are relevant,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.770
this is not the normal preamble you should skip,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.650
so get your fingers off of the fast forward

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.290
plus 30 seconds or plus 10 minute button.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.240
A few more stories about walking the talk.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.150
I'm continuing to shrink my team.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.430
I'm finding new places for them to work.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.070
One of the things, one of the techniques

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.750
I should probably mention I haven't gotten into is

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.110
I do regular one-on-ones with all of the Dev Leads

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.300
I work with and that's been super helpful

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.900
in kind of keeping the culture going

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.260
and enabling the people who no longer work for me

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.220
to continue to be successful.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.140
So I met with another Dev Lead this week

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.100
and we talked about moving one of my leads

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.700
to work for him and what that meant

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.260
and part of the deal was that I of course

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.780
continued my one-on-ones with the lead

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.460
and I would begin regular one-on-ones with this Dev Lead

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.260
as part of this transition for indefinitely.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And I think I've got to a tipping point

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.740
where I haven't counted, but I believe

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.220
I have more one-on-ones, and these aren't just chat,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.290
these are about careers, about solving problems,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.650
it's about mentoring and coaching.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.250
I have more one-on-ones with people

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.250
who do not work for me than people who do work for me.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.970
Is that primarily because you've made them

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.250
stop working for you?

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.090
Yes.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.930
Okay.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.050
Yes, but we still meet,

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.330
because they still find,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.130
that's one of the primary questions I get,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.450
which is as I move people away,

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.250
it's like can we still meet?

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.610
I said yes, of course, I think it's necessary.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.250
But I also find that one of the techniques

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.970
I use that we haven't talked about

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.050
is meeting regularly with those Dev Leads.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.970
Culture change until it sticks

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.690
and is able to run on its own volition

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.440
needs a lot of care.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.920
I think it's, yes, and I think the value of communication

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.000
and keeping lines of communication open

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.070
and establishing trust are severely underrated.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.870
There is...

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.310
Not in my particular business,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.160
trust is everything for what I do.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.600
But you're talking about trust of the data.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.280
I'm talking about trust of the people.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.400
Not just the trust of the data,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.840
but the trust of my team.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.720
There is still a high degree

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.080
of data science and magic are synonyms.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.870
There's a quote about this.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.710
Yes.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.650
And when people do not have the time

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.030
to get deep in the math,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.130
they don't have the patience to do it

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.270
anyway, a large number of people don't wanna.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.270
But I am asking them to change their decision-making process

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.360
based off of a human, me, my team's analysis

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.880
of what the data is saying.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.000
But I'm talking, I am talking about

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
a different kind of trust,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.480
because that is definitely needed there

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.880
and I understand what you're saying.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.120
I'm talking about this foundation of trust

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.600
you have to have that enables us to have conflict

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.760
and sometimes severe and active conflict,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.420
meaning we'll argue.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.160
But it's not, we don't matter to each other,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.880
but we can have, because we have trust,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.620
we know we're flushing out the idea.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.200
And I believe that only the-

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.200
The difference between debate and argument is trust.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.000
Very well put, very well put.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.400
And that's where good decisions and good ideas come from.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.760
The way we've talked about where ideas come from

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.400
while other ideas get together,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.280
the way you get them to get together

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.160
in a more meaningful way is to have debate.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.200
Yes, debate, it doesn't sit right with me,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.200
but I think I'll, I think I'm going down a semantic road.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.040
You are, you are.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.880
I completely agree.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.280
And I'll go back to conflict.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.520
There's a fear of, I just talked to someone this week,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.040
one of the dead leads has a massive fear of conflict.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.120
And one of the things I, my job is to do

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.200
is to draw that conflict out of him.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.720
But I have to establish that trust first.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.880
So we do it slowly.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.560
I don't just say, what the hell were you doing?

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.100
I have to draw those things out.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.600
So I met, speaking of meeting with Lee, dead leads,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.760
Brent wants to say something.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.760
Yes.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.480
What is worse, a yes man or a no man?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.300
Oh, that's actually a very good question.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.310
I think, I have no preference

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.790
because I think they're both,

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.830
they're both equally bad is my best answer.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.110
I don't know which, I can't decide if one's worse or not.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.350
Do you have a preference?

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.710
Yes, man is absolutely worse.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.080
Cause their last rider wins

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.320
when you don't have the ability to.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.380
But at least somebody wins, but the no man, nobody wins.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.040
No, the no man is predictable and trust,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.200
you can trust what they're going to say.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.060
And they don't always say no.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:05.230
The long-term being a no man, the risk is of course,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.750
that you'll establish a reputation

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.050
of not being a team player.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.860
But the yes man, when they say yes,

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.700
it's just a matter of time before, they'll say yes,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.220
but then their actions is actually a no.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.860
One of the attributes of leadership

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.660
and actually one of the people I talked to

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.110
that's been working for me, asked me,

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.100
we were talking about the quality culture transition model,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.940
which someone called the constantly improving quality model,

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.440
which is pronounced Sycam, which I kind of like.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.280
But he said,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.440
I thought you didn't want it to be a model though.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.600
What about his transition guide?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.800
Yes. Okay.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.500
He said, what would that look like for leadership?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.260
And the problem is, is there are leadership models

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.900
and they suck.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.120
So I'm a little afraid to do it,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120
but in thinking through it,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.440
I promise I might think through it.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.760
And I think I will do something that I'll share even

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.360
on a much smaller basis.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.520
By the way, I am not going to dump,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.220
at least in the time being,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.400
the quality culture transition guide to the masses,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.640
but it has been shared in our Slack channel.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.240
So you can join that or ask me

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.680
and I'll give you a view of a draft of it,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.800
but I'm not just gonna dump it out on the blog

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.480
or the website at this point.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.560
But I was thinking about this growth path,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.640
this transition guide for becoming a new leader

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.800
to an experienced leader.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.580
And one of the attributes is,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.880
this is actually all coming back,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.880
is decision making.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.820
And a yes man can't make a decision.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.200
Well, they can't make a proper decision

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.280
because everything's yes.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.360
So anyway, I was talking-

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.420
They're deferring to a different decision maker.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.060
Yes.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.900
And they want to please.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.940
They don't want to cause conflict.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.900
They want to please,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.780
but that's not the way to be a leader.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.000
It does not help anyone.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.160
So I was meeting with,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.100
there's a story I'm getting to here eventually.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.040
I went to San Francisco Tuesday for the day,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.060
met with a bunch of important people down there.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.740
And one thing,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.220
and a lot of them are just normal,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.620
like talking with leads on how things are going,

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.620
getting an idea of how their quality is going,

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.420
quality, culture, et cetera.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.060
Not that exciting.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.980
One interesting thing happened internally lately.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.540
We did a little bit of a reorg,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.060
nothing to do with my org directly,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:35.250
but we moved where some of our internal tools,

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.210
substrate engineering happens,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.250
to work through the ads team.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.410
And tell me if this sounds familiar.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.250
I want to get back to that point.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.830
You moved into Microsoft GitHub?

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.680
I'm guessing not.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.780
Your body language says no.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.120
No, we use, what's it called?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.580
Azure DevOps?

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.810
You're right, Azure DevOps.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.590
Is it Azure DevOps for GitHub?

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.430
Great name.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.510
No, it's not a great name.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.630
It's the stupidest freaking name in the world.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.830
This from the team who brought you XT.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.670
Oh God.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.480
So we moved around.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.320
So there's a central tools team,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.400
it's the best way of putting it.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.560
We made a small reorg.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.200
So central tools team now reports

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.830
through my ads organization.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.590
And while I like it,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.710
it's in a much better place

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.260
than the lead was, I knew was good.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.020
I worry because, and you can relate to this,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.820
how many times at Microsoft

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.420
do we have some sort of tool used

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.500
that was or set of tools

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.140
that were to be used by the whole company

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:52.470
but were owned or owned and managed in a specific org?

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.950
Okay, now Brent's making a face.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:59.610
How many of those were successful?

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.250
Brent's counting on his fingers.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.170
Yeah, so I was understandably worried.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.310
But, so, go ahead.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.470
And then, because I,

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.710
there is a happy ending here.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.750
I don't want the Unity listeners to go,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.870
oh my God, what comes next?

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.350
So get to your thing and I'll evolve my thought here.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:28.020
No, so there's systems ebb and flow.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.180
Okay, and then this is a particular,

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.100
what you're talking about is a particular system.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.860
I have been aware of, particularly at this company,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.420
and I think it's more than just this company,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.810
almost within the first few years.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:52.210
And that is the pendulum on how engineering tools

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.620
should be built constantly swings.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.440
It goes, oh, duplication of effort.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.760
We should centralize.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.250
Well, and then that over pivots

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.250
because then once it's centralized and it's valuable,

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.330
these guys stop having a relationship

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
with the actual consumers.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.050
And they start doing make work exercises

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.610
to adjust their continual existence.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.680
They eventually get called out

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.840
because their dependency teams aren't able

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.160
to solve the problems that they need to from this team.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.330
And then that begins to swing back towards decentralization.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.370
And then it's just a matter of time

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.730
before duplication of effort.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.410
And it just goes back and forth and back and forth.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.730
Microsoft especially likes to swing pendulums

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.680
in its decision making.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.040
There is a way to do this in a centralized manner.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.280
No, and I agree with that.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.880
And I'm actually, I'm 100% confident it will work

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.760
because the thought models of the lead in charge

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.620
of this org and I are super highly aligned.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.700
That's one reason I think it will work.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.980
But also, let me ask you a question, Brent.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.390
What are the Microsoft values?

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.870
Yeah, I never knew either in my 22 years there.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.750
No, I mean, they've changed so many times

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:30.480
and unfortunately here I am, I will absolutely-

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.800
I can't name a single Microsoft value.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.970
I will absolutely state with high confidence

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.050
that if I had it loaded up, I would agree with it.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.250
Because every time when new set comes out,

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.770
I look at it and go,

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:51.130
I first evaluate it against some manager buzzwordy stuff.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.930
I don't know why I still do that

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.870
because it passes that test 100% of the time.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.330
But then I go, okay, if I look at the intent behind this,

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.810
do I agree?

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.930
And more often than not, I do.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.170
But while that part is good,

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.610
the way I look at it is you have a vision or a mission

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.570
for what you're doing and what you're going to be doing

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:18.250
and the values guide you in how you make decisions

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.690
along the way towards your mission and vision.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.930
So if they're not really,

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.430
if they're not accessible,

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.060
if they're not part of how you make decisions inherently,

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.500
and maybe the big thing, maybe the challenge is there is

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.050
a lot of times when I worked at Microsoft,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.650
I felt Xbox One was a difference.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.130
Windows 95 was an outlier.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.250
I always felt like I was too many degrees

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.080
separated from my customer.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.920
Sure.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.740
So anyway, back on track.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.180
I would argue that was mostly because

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.460
a lot of that was number one,

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.740
you were in a test role.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.220
Number two, you were in a traditional test role

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.100
most of that time.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.380
And number two was...

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.300
Was that two number twos?

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.140
On-prem product.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.980
No, I was...

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.020
Yes, yes.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.460
And so...

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.300
No, I get it, I get it.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.140
So anyway, so I am going to loop this back in

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.540
and get to our other, our mailbag question.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.820
We have four values at Unity.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.620
Value one, then there's value two.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.620
Yes, users first.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.420
Okay, that's okay, whatever.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.540
The customer is the only one able to evaluate

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.380
the quality of the product.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.220
Best users first.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.900
So yep, I can totally support that.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.740
Yep.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.940
Meanwhile, actually the people that argue with that one

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.960
don't listen to the podcast, so we're cool.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.040
Best ideas win.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.680
This is where conflict and trust and actually

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.960
doesn't matter if you're the hippo,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.720
as Ronnie Quavie puts it,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.880
the highest paid person in the organization.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.960
The best ideas win.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.560
Yeah, the problem with that one is often who gets to judge.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.840
But if you have...

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.940
As a value, I completely agree.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.620
I'm gonna refer directly to it

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.340
because I eased around it,

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.740
but Pat Linceone's book,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.060
The Fight is Functions of a Team,

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.980
probably his most popular business novel.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.860
I've read all of them.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.060
I'm a huge fanboy of his.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.020
It talks about if you have that trust,

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.940
you can get over the fear of conflict.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.540
You can then have people,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.260
if they feel like their voice is heard,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.340
even if they didn't go with their decision,

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.420
they will have buy-in and accountability

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.540
for achieving whatever or acting

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.380
on whatever decision was made.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.460
So I believe all that works together

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.780
and that's where best ideas win.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:34.010
Come from the judge is maybe consensus.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.170
It may not be,

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.210
but at least you feel like your voice was heard

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.050
during that discussion

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.210
and you weren't like stifled out.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.770
It's like, shut up, newbie.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.090
Doesn't happen.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.770
Yeah, I'll stop testing your principles

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.890
because I do agree with them.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.810
There's no such thing as a best idea either.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.570
Okay, now I'll stop.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.880
Are you sure?

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.650
No, but I'll try.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.930
Anything else?

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.300
What's value number three, Alan?

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.380
And for the sake of time,

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.340
I'll skip to the fourth one,

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.660
the one that I wanted to be relevant.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.300
I probably should have just mentioned this one

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.540
and skipped to the other one

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.460
so I could not have your damn value testing,

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.820
but in it together.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.220
When I think about this,

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.500
and again, these values can be words on paper

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.900
that you can agree with,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.220
but as a culture,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.340
the company does work very well together.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.340
People try to and want to help each other

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.860
regardless of what division they're in.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.780
And while it has improved, admittedly,

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.380
the org chart cartoon

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.780
that shows all the divisions pointing guns at each other

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.580
is still partially to largely true,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.860
or at least it was two years ago when I left.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.940
And that's what I saw on these tools

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.620
or these systems that were developed in one org

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.340
but shared is when push came to shove,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.220
100 times out of 100,

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.380
the work was done,

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.460
the preference was for the local team

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.380
versus helping the other teams.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.580
And sometimes people would get worse.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.800
I watched at Microsoft,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.080
teams would get completely bought in

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.920
and committed and integrated into using a tool

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.320
developed by another team

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.870
who wanted to be used by everyone.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.470
And then they decided they were too busy

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.470
and just stopped supporting it

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.950
and said, no, you're on your own.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.950
Freaking committed,

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.750
we built all our adapters on our end

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.910
and now we're screwed, thank you very much.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.150
And said, not our problem.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.160
Yeah, there's...

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.480
That happened, that happened.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.680
Did you get the culture

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.000
that your incentive model inspires?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.840
Yes.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.440
Absolutely.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.680
I was thinking about,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.970
what is it, Jack Welch, right?

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.170
A lot of the foundation of this company

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:57.170
was based off of Jack Welchian philosophy,

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:02.410
which I do think probably applies to sales.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.110
But unfortunately, one of our big leaders

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.630
in the history of this company

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.110
was just a masterful salesperson.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.800
And I don't think the culture

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.960
that they put onto the company,

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.760
I don't think enough thought was put into

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.560
as to whether or not

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.140
that is applicable outside of sales.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:31.320
Oftentimes, I don't have the data here,

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.350
but I hear that it is often the case in sales

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:41.700
that the top 10% of your sales force

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:48.960
is providing greater than 50% of the value,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.740
the business, the sales.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.560
And so there's this idea of,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.490
well then we should reward that.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.090
I don't know that management science

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.850
has found a good solution for this one yet.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.530
I do know, for example, they have discovered

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.680
that if you wanna grow company performance,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.140
you randomly promote people.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.580
You randomly switch between the best employee

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.740
and the worst employee,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.980
because a lot of times the worst employee

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.140
isn't suited for the job that they have.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.450
They should be in more of a strategic role.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.290
No.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.330
I've seen it over and over again.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.210
Okay, whatever.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.090
Anyway, I'm not sure why your microphone

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.090
is not pointing at your neck,

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.890
but I'm just gonna ignore that.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.850
And we'll go on.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.130
I have a question from a coworker.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.910
Actually, if I could draw better,

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.230
and I've been working on it,

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.670
I really should do better.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.270
Monty, Monty.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.950
We got a cartoon, we need a comic strip

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:54.950
to go with this recording

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.190
that just goes through the hell

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.030
I go through every week.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.190
Every other week, or sometimes every third week.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.910
So a coworker asked a question,

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.950
and one thing I wanna mention is,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.630
an odd thing, and maybe slightly uncomfortable

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.670
for me thing at Unity is,

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.670
despite Unity being 1 1 hundredth

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.270
of the size of Microsoft,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.260
I have more podcast listeners at Unity

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.300
than I did at Microsoft.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.620
And sometimes it's surprised like someone.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.340
As a percentage or as a person?

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.640
As a number.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.480
As a number.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.360
And maybe there were more Microsoft listeners

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.000
or there are than I think,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.520
but there are a chunk of Unity listeners

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.840
and hey, shouting out to you,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.320
this is for you.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.640
Well I hope if I say things that piss you off,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.550
you tell me.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.630
That's all I'll say.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.230
But anyway, Klaus.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.070
Who was awesome?

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.610
Klaus.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.090
I love the name Klaus.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.090
I always have to say it in a German accent.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.170
Yeah, he's Danish.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.970
I am too-ish.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.490
You're something-ish.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.930
Anyway, in general, Klaus asked if we could talk more

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:09.320
about how the context-driven testing principles

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.720
compare, contrast, interact, whatever

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.960
with the modern testing principles.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.160
Sure.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.120
So I will quickly read through,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.800
actually Brent, should I go through all seven?

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.840
Actually, if you can limit your,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.680
no I'll read them.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.840
And I want you to comment,

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.040
but I don't want you to comment like

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.320
the diatribe story upon story interwoven

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.560
into an inception-like view of the world.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.720
I just want a few comments on each one after I read it.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.720
So one commonality between the modern testing principles

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.000
and the context-driven testing principles

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.210
is that we both have seven.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.610
Yes.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.140
Number one, the value of any practice

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.740
depends on its context.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.640
Is that a principle or a statement of fact?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.480
Between the-

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.320
I guess it's a principle

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.470
because you could actually,

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.280
I would phrase it differently, but yeah.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.680
Remember how I said I was gonna let you comment?

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.570
I'm sorry.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.900
Yeah, so I think it's not a principle.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.980
I don't think this is what we should do

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.750
for the CDT stuff, but for me,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.230
a principle is sort of a philosophical,

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:33.230
unproven vision direction setting.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.210
This is the direction we're heading.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.570
To me, the principles kind of reads more like a proof,

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:44.720
mathematical proof.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.560
Yep.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.440
Like, is there anyone who would say

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.090
the value of a practice doesn't depend on this context?

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.370
That would imply the value of,

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:59.370
there are some practices where the value of the practice

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.710
is context-free.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.290
I can't think of an example.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.330
I actually can't either.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:11.810
When I talk about the modern testing principles in,

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.010
and actually I gave a webinar on Thanksgiving

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.970
to an audience in Ukraine

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.690
because I had nothing else going on.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.130
By the way, happy late Thanksgiving there to you, Brent.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:20.970
Hey, thanks.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.130
And I've done this, I think,

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:27.320
in all of the presentations I've done on modern testing

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.360
where I go back and talk about why I decided to start

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.960
with modern testing principles

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.400
and it goes back to,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:45.360
I happen to be reading a book by Ray Dalio called Principles.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.680
And then you think, yeah,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.560
I had, of course I had known about principles before.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.800
So I use that as the starting point.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.960
So I use Ray Dalio's definition of principles,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.120
which are principles are what allow you

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.600
to live a life consistent with those values.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.840
Principles connect your values to your actions.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.800
And when I look at the,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.120
anyway, I don't wanna critique,

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.080
like these aren't principles all day, but that one's.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.360
No, I don't wanna either.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.360
Cause the one thing that I've observed with,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.040
with another commonality between CDT and MT

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.440
is they both target testers

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.690
and testers just love tearing things apart.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.530
So let's not do that here

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:36.330
because what I see with MT is when that happened,

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.250
the message gets lost

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.760
because everyone's busily piecing through semantics.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.450
Right, so the value of any practice depends on its context.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:53.680
I don't think MT says anything pro or against this.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.480
Agree?

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.320
Agree.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.160
Agree.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.000
Agree.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.240
So these are more of beliefs than principles was my point.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.640
There are good practices in context, this is number two.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.460
There are good practices in context,

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.500
but there are no best practices.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.340
Okay.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.420
Again, MT doesn't say anything for or against this.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.260
Correct.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.630
I do agree with it.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.950
Yeah, yeah, because you said something about it earlier,

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.980
which was actually interesting.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.860
And it depends on your definition of best.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.300
And if you use the dictionary definition,

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.340
yeah, I agree with it.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.620
There's always something better.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.220
People working, number three, people working together

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.180
are the most important part of any project's context.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.180
That's very similar to agile principles.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.020
What?

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.060
It's people over, oh my,

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:47.720
fuck, edge today.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.560
All right.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.840
So one day I will come through on my promise to Periscope,

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.240
one of our sessions.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.440
Again, you must experience the hell

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.800
that is an A-B testing requirement.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.920
Oh my God.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.440
People working together are the most important part

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.720
of any project's context.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.020
Dude, you need some meds.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.580
People working together.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.100
So people working together.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.180
I don't disagree.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.380
I don't disagree.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.620
And we could potentially argue the community principle

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.140
is related to this one.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.260
They don't contradict.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.500
In terms of the most important part,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.250
that would be something,

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.290
so the spirit of it, I agree with.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.090
The literal interpretation,

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.890
I'm not certain I agree with yet.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.930
And I don't wanna spend the time thinking about it now.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.170
Number four, projects unfold over time

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.650
in ways that are often not predictable.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.000
True?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.960
I think that's a bit of a tautology.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.560
But yeah.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.040
I guess it really lies more with an agile principle.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.430
We believe there's something about being adaptable.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.510
What is it, principle two?

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.910
Continuous deployment and-

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.390
Continuous improvement.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:16.780
So MT does sort of address this.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.300
But in terms of more of an actionable thing,

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.380
like the continuous deployment theory of constraints,

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.380
that is an MT principle because we agree with number four.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.300
So this was interesting.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.820
Number five, the product is a solution.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.880
If the problem isn't solved, the product doesn't work.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.600
And this actually aligns exactly-

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.800
With the customer principle.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.160
With the principle number five of the MT principles,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.540
which is the one, well, they're like saying,

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.500
if someone who is a believer or follow these principles

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.260
did not like number five,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.180
it would be like them saying the product,

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.300
if they believe this, that the product isn't solved,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.860
the product doesn't work,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.740
well, only the customer is able to tell

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.220
if their solution is, if their problem is solved.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:08.030
I am willing to bet, I have not done the research,

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.590
but I am willing to bet that there is

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.010
as much controversy on this one

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.790
as there is on our principle.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.310
Interesting.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.390
But to me, it's just like, yes,

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.390
we've talked about the Tom Popendike quote

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.430
about customers don't want software,

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.590
they want their problem solved.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.150
I believe that 1 million percent, if that was possible.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.050
I could imagine it would be,

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.550
but in a certain context, it is a solution.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.470
So does that mean the problem,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.350
I could see that they-

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.990
Oh, listen, this doesn't make any sense,

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.830
but I wanna say it.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:43.100
In a certain context, is a context really a context?

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.060
Not enough coffee, dude.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.480
Okay, there's not enough in the world.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.660
Number six, good software testing

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.710
is a challenging intellectual process.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.390
Good software development

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.990
is a challenging intellectual process.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:01.210
Good cooking is a challenging intellectual process, et cetera.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.920
Yes.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.760
Good, and I will object-

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.920
Place verb here.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.160
Good knowledge work.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.980
And often we forget that testing is just knowledge work.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.680
I shouldn't say just, but testing is knowledge work.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.300
Yes, yes, it's a challenging intellectual process.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.340
I guess it's, again, a belief?

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.380
No, it's not a belief.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.360
As you just called out.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.840
The one thing I think where we might disagree,

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.540
we will absolutely agree that good knowledge work

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.780
is a challenging intellectual process.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.780
I don't think we fully agree with what I interpret as

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:50.170
an implied over ascension of the testing rule.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:59.280
Because specifically calling this out is interesting.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.340
Why did they say testing and not knowledge work

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.520
or development or whatever?

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.360
Right, they're trying to elevate it.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:11.360
When I see this principle applied even from whoever,

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.200
whether they're followers of the principles or not,

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.440
it's more them trying to justify,

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.370
what I see more often is a justification of their role.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.690
But my job's important, it's actually very, very hard.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:28.050
I wasn't there for the development, so I do see that,

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.130
but I don't know that the developers

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.730
of these principles intended that.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.730
There's some things I wanna get beyond here.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.850
So number seven, only through judgment and skill,

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.890
exercise cooperatively throughout the entire project

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:42.130
are we able to do the right things at the right times

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.930
to effectively test our products.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.610
Which is kind of a summation of a lot of these.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.810
But how is this trying to figure out

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.650
how it fits in with modern testing?

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.010
If it fits in with MT principles

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.000
any more or less than the others?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.240
It occurs to me that there's another similarity

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.320
between MT and CDT here.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.670
And that there is only one principle

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.050
that contains the word test.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.370
Very interesting, that's good.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.530
And actually one, and remember these are much, much older

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.690
than the modern testing principles.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:22.490
I believe, I think the first time I saw these published

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:24.450
was when lessons learned came out.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.810
They may have been revised since then,

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.730
but that was many, many years ago.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:34.620
But the one thing I like is when many people have read,

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.380
and despite those of you, again,

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.420
you listeners aren't the art.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.420
Besides those who have argued

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.640
with principles number five and seven,

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.600
a lot of people, many people, read the principles

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.360
or see a presentation on the principles and go,

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.400
oh yeah, that's just common sense.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.960
And I think maybe at the time,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.000
and maybe for some people today even,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.200
these read like common sense.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.560
Because you can nod your head and go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.560
Again, I think this was, so looking at it now,

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.680
and then thinking it through the light of,

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.680
you know, if we change the word testing in number six

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.240
or the word knowledge work,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.000
the spirit of this is probably nothing

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.680
I would disagree with, right?

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:27.040
But might even argue it's a bit of a tautology.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.040
But.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.280
There's not much here that I could think,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.240
I think you mentioned number five,

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.560
but may cause some disagreement,

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.920
but I don't know where disagreement,

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.760
again, so much has changed in the 10 or more years

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.600
these first came out.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.800
And that's actually the point I was gonna next make,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.940
is essentially when these were developed though,

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.200
and if there's something,

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.880
this is something we have explicitly called out

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.000
in the modern testing principles.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.400
We fully acknowledge, we don't know when,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.320
when we observe it, we'll both stand up and say,

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.480
yes, this has happened.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.680
But we know there's an expiration date

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.440
on the usefulness of the modern testing principles.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.350
We know, we don't know what it is,

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.040
but we know there's an expiration date.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.260
This came out in the, I don't know,

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.100
the golden age of traditional testing.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:26.940
Oh yeah, for sure.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.780
I'll show it.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.100
Right, and one of the problems that happened

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.820
back in those days,

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.100
people were hiring armies of.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.540
Unskilled testers.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.620
Unskilled testers.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.860
You know how to turn on a computer?

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.740
We needed a tester.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.220
I was there for that.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:49.640
Manual testing happened all of the time.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.000
It was heavily unskilled.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.240
It was a thoughtless process.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.920
You still see a fair chunk of that in the gaming industry.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.720
Hiring people at minimum wage,

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.120
to bang through a game over and over and over.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.880
And quite honestly, I don't have a problem with that.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.160
I don't either.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.350
If that is the most efficient and cost effective way

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.150
of going from A to B,

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.950
A, knock yourself out, business.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.550
The thing I'm actually,

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.700
but when I look at this now,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.900
instead of looking at it from a historical point of view,

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.100
from a historical point of view,

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.540
I think this helped add value.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:45.020
It basically said testing is knowledge work,

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:50.760
not a thoughtless exercise.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.220
I think it helped solve that problem.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.060
I think it did too.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.260
One thing maybe missing is the wrap up.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.860
We have accelerated the achievable quality

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.940
and the principle support that mission.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.780
Yes.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.940
I wonder, and I'm not gonna scroll through the whole page

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.980
here, but there's some statement that wraps all this up.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.680
But yeah, I'll agree with what you said.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.440
I think there's nothing wrong with these.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.120
Some are a bit tautological,

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.370
but given the time these came out,

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.950
yeah, totally valid.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:24.970
I'm not gonna dive into,

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.410
if you go to contextdriventesting.com,

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.210
if I'm smart and I'm not,

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.360
I would add a link to that in our show notes.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.680
There's illustrations of the principles in action,

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.920
which we will,

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.840
I don't wanna dive into

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.720
because we will disagree with those in many ways,

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.680
but they do support the principles

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.480
and they do support the time

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.640
in which these were written and came out.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.300
Yeah, I would say, looking at it now,

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:54.170
there's nothing in here I really find a problem with

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.810
except for potentially the highlighting,

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.390
or what I was saying about-

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.990
Testers have to be smart.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.990
No, it's,

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.870
this is,

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:08.070
these are in alignment

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.710
with modern testing,

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:15.140
except perhaps how you interpret number six.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.320
I completely agree,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.100
good software testing is a challenging intellectual exercise.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.860
If you use that to justify your position or over elevate,

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.020
that is where I'm going to disagree

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.120
with using those words.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.300
I completely agree with what's written there.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.340
My biggest gripe when these came out was,

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.180
I read them and said,

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.420
yeah, but all good testing is context driven.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.300
I think at the time though,

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.900
there was a lot, a lot of bad testing.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.900
So the authors felt the need to find a way

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.740
to step out of that.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.580
And it's kind of the,

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.380
it's ish is a way we came up

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.540
with the modern testing principles.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.540
We viewed traditional testing practices,

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.260
whether they're context driven or not,

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.740
as a bad way to make software.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:04.740
You could actually even argue MT is following

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.140
the principles of CDT.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.460
We could say that MT is the context driven solution

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.460
for shipping software at scale to millions of users.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.380
One of the things I was gonna say is that

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:25.420
one thing that is common between these two sets

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.540
of principles is,

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.540
and I don't think MT actually explicitly calls it out.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.640
And I would actually argue

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.840
that's pretty much all they're doing in CDT.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.360
In that taking the systems view is critical.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.480
Now we've laid that out as a fundamental basis

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.720
for how we develop this.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.680
I actually kind of look at this now and go,

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.230
that's actually what they're saying, right?

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.630
You have to take a systems view.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.730
And system view has multiple different moving parts.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.700
We agree, totally agree.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.180
One of the things I would actually say is MT

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.180
is built around the context has changed.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.900
We are now dealing with a new context

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.960
and the traditional methods are kind of not applicable.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.720
What got you here isn't gonna get you there.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.400
Right, but context has driven that fact.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.020
Yeah. One could say.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.240
I think we're out of time.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.880
So that was fun.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.720
Thanks Klaus.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.360
And hopefully that answered your question.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.280
Anything else to add, B man?

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.940
No.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.100
All right, we'll see you next time

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.220
for our end of the year extravaganza.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:49.380
Please send us your requests for things you want us

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.380
to make predictions about or talk about or reflect on.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.860
Otherwise we'll fake it and do it ourselves.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.700
Yes.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.800
I think I'm winning an Emmy this year.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.670
Not sure, I think I am.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:01.510
Okay.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.350
All right, that's my final.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.170
Congrats.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.070
Okay, see you next time.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:04.910
Bye.
