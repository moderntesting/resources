00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.810
Hey welcome welcome to another

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.040
AV testing recording. Thank you for joining me. You're welcome. We're doing a podcast and it is number. What number are we?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.440
63 63 s not a prime number. When's our next prime number 67? So hey, how you doing?

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.620
I'm tired. Why are you tired? Well, we're partying. No

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.570
we're

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.130
Didn't get the sleep. I needed last night. I guess coffee's not working. Sorry about that. Sorry about that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.810
So after after our recording last time

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.610
Random things to talk about after we recorded last time. I know I'm still in maybe honeymoon period

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.490
How long is honeymoon period last to a new job? When am I out of the honeymoon?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.300
When you when you when I eat it and want to leave

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.250
No, that's way past. Yeah, that's the divorce date. Okay when you finally have your first real complaint

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.580
Huh? Okay, I'm still in the honeymoon phase

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.360
But Brent mentioned after the last episode of we'd stopped recording said he looked happier than you have in a long time forever

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.180
Even better I have to not that this is going to be a direct dig on Microsoft

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.060
But I had a doctor appointment my just physical last week

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.520
Had the big the full like seven vials of blood drawn and follow up a few weeks later

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.640
And in my doctor's words, my blood is perfect

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.150
Which is good, but the better thing is are you typo? I'm a positive

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.330
I am a plus two nice. I share some blood

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.650
Maybe

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.710
But you know, it's cool not is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.650
For the as long as I can remember

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.250
I mean growing up and even into my 20s and 30s my blood pressure 120 over 70 like clockwork

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.250
it started drifting up as

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.650
They got older and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.610
Seemed just like an older thing like and it was as high as like 138 over 80 I think

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.530
Which isn't like massively high but higher

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.350
They were able to decompose the blood pressure algorithm

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.950
Yeah, it's it's to me. I've always it's lowers better

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.780
Lowers better. Yes, but if if one number is lower and the other one's way through the roof, what does that mean?

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.620
I don't know. I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.460
don't know physiologically but ones like when the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.900
the number where you they squeeze your arm till they can't feel the pulse anymore and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.540
The numbers are the first moment they can feel it they can detect it and then when they can't detect it anymore

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.740
Yeah, I think it's a measure of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.760
Your pressure in your veins when your heart's beating and when it's not beating

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.000
Sure, sure, but mine have been drifting up and it been definitely in the upper 130s for the last 10 years

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.680
Last week after almost six months at Unity

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.350
Maybe coincidental. Maybe not

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.960
120 over 70 back to where I was so you found your inner calm

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.880
Well, it helps not having your manager for example call you at 9 o'clock on a Friday and question your decisions from the day

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300
I

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300
Too

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.740
It was interesting. So when did you go in for your physical?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.980
The actual appointment was last Tuesday. Oh, I

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.100
For the first time in five years went for my quote-unquote annual

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.040
Physical last Friday and I don't have so I had the blood test scheduled this week

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.120
But that was fantastic

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.920
First and foremost that changed doctors this time around we have a we have Microsoft has its own little clinic

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.120
Oh, yeah, one of the clinic over in the building where I used to work in building 22 yet it and

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.600
When I was in engineering excellence, where we did neither the more I interact with those guys the better

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.490
This is the first time where I had a doctor that is

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.410
younger than me and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.880
I actually found that to be quite cool

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.100
Because the one of the things is because they didn't use leeches on you

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.980
Yeah

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.220
In essence modern medicine the and I realized this I'm like, huh this

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.180
So I've been I've been with this the prior doctor. I don't know 20 years

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.170
Wow, and he's I

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.690
Like the fact of going to a younger doctor because they they are more up to speed

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.570
Yeah, absolutely like 10 years from now. I'll probably switch again

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.100
Maybe even more often, but yeah, that is one thing

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.620
I've heard a lot is that younger doctors one of us true from younger testers probably not

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.800
If if they taught testing in college that might be true

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.300
Right younger coders probably are gonna be better than current ones. Maybe hey speaking of testing. Yeah

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.020
Have you read the software testing article on Wikipedia? No

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.790
You want to get have a frustrating 15 minutes of your life

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.560
Sure

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.200
A peeve of mine for a while has been the software testing Wikipedia page

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.480
Oh, wait, wait, I have read that but that like you're talking about like the it is

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.000
What is software testing is poorly cited?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.920
Full it's just written in written in the time period in which yeah highlighting techniques from the 1990

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.920
No before it was rolling. I think

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.240
I don't think Wikipedia was long and then Noah Sussman who's awesome

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.880
Went in maybe four or five maybe six months ago. It was a while back. Maybe three months

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.240
I don't know time when you're old as me time is lost

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.280
he went in and made a whole bunch of edits like a whole bunch of edits and

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.420
Made a pretty good-looking page still I would question some of his citations as reputable sources

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.200
But a pretty good start and it was

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.450
Whole scale rejected by the curator of the page

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.770
For various reasons that weren't well supported in the talk page

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:45.770
Very frustrating. I'm not sure why no, but why Noah didn't just blow up but I keep on reading it thinking

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.770
Okay, I'm gonna try and make some headway here, too

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.770
I'm gonna come in and help him and figure out how to make this incrementally and

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.140
It ended up being one of those problems I realized I just could not do by myself because again

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.360
it would just be my opinion versus Noah's opinion and it needed to have a

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.960
some sort of

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.120
coordinated effort among

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.000
Diverse set of opinions. So

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.360
Now what why did the curator reject it?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.520
Too many changes at once was the big one

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.040
Okay, so we definitely have to go through and make smaller changes

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.860
I think it's going to require at some point before we get too far

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.840
I'll want to involve them in these discussions, but and

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.190
Backtracking from that a little bit what I did in on Friday last Friday

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.030
I had a few minutes

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.350
I wanted to read through the page again and see what I could do and I just gave up and I was so

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.230
in such a mood about it that I created a

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:59.780
Sock team to get people together to fix the software testing Wikipedia page, you know is involved in a

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.940
bunch of other people and

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.060
Inviting more and more as we go along

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.740
It's you can DM me on Twitter Alan Page and I'll send you an invitation

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.740
I think I'm all caught up there or

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.140
Contact me in any one of the other ways which a good tester should be able to figure out how to find me and

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.820
I mean my my email address is are all over the internet if you can't find my address

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.620
Maybe you should find a career that requires less investigation

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.820
Just saying I

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.620
Want to use I'm not a big fan of needing to develop consensus, but this is one of those situations

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.300
We're building some consensus and some allies on

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.140
how to go about making

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.940
The software testing article not only represent software testing better, but being an article that doesn't look

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.900
amateurish and stupid compared to the bulk of Wikipedia articles, which are

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:04.780
There are some trash out there, of course, but most of the least major ones are very competently done

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.020
Well cited based on reputable sources is your goal

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.860
To finally define what is software testing? No begin Wikipedia is a

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.980
Encyclopedia not a dictionary. Yeah

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.460
So no, it's not the goal. The goal is to

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.420
If someone were to want to read about software testing didn't know much about it

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
for them to get a

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:37.180
Clear idea of we can include some history as well. But what software testing is in the 21st century

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.500
Okay

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:47.560
Now the curator, how is that defined? Is that an employee of Wikipedia? No, I'm not actually sure

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.280
Where he came from. I don't know how that works

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.080
I have to learn how that works and get him and I'll get him involved. I'll invite him to the

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.840
The slack team I originally was gonna try and have all this conversation in the talk channel

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.480
but for each Wikipedia page has a talk page, but it

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.160
The type of discussions needs you just aren't conducive for that

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.640
So it's gonna be it's not gonna be quick

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.600
It's gonna take a while but I'm hoping with if we can get there's like 30 people

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.480
already on this in the slack group and

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.280
I hope I can just

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.840
Summer just there to lurk which is fine and we'll make pockets of progress and little pieces

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.940
But I hope we can sort of get a strategy together and how we want to do it and then start executing on those changes

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.560
I really want to use Noah's page as a model, but also I'm

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.640
As I mentioned a few times in that team already. I'm

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.440
open for other

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.200
Opinions and and strategies and and just because I started the channel. I don't get extra votes

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.280
I just want to be the one to make sure it moves forward

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.960
you should

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.620
Recommendation for you

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.820
Post this as a query on the general channel in our slack channel

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:12.160
because one of the things that I think is potentially interesting is there's a lot of other

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.290
podcast owners

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:21.470
Connected to our slack channel. Yeah, and Percy's already in but I'll definitely mention it there and I'll probably

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:29.570
Retweet about it. I did a blog post on Friday and I'll remind people and the words getting out. I didn't see your blood post

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:37.180
Well, it's there okay cool. So anyway that's going on. I don't know what else

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.880
Summer summer has been good in Seattle so far. Yeah, it doesn't feel like I've spent much time in Seattle

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.140
On the weekends with with the kiddo going off to college

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.470
and

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.360
Baseball season although baseball season ended last weekend

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:07.640
This is this this past weekend is the first weekend in a long time that I didn't have something both days scheduled

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.040
I didn't know what to do with myself. I

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:18.360
Clean the house. I cooked I cooked you just fyi random information before we get on with the show

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.400
I invited my entire team to come visit me in Seattle this this fall

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.180
And everywhere every everyone everywhere

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.750
Everyone everywhere nice, so if they all show up should be

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.070
37 people 36 people

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.360
Depends on hiring

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.560
You gonna work on an all-hands?

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.960
Deck, I think we'll do a lot of sort of open space type stuff all scheduled a few

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.800
talks

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.760
Shorter talks. I don't believe in. I don't really like hour-long talks lots of sharing

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.400
We'll do a little bit of cross-team projects a little bit of a hack. You know hack day half hack day

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.980
But lots of open space type stuff so people can

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.830
Sort of decide the topics on the fly. I'm I like that format seems to work pretty well

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:15.210
Yep, and it should be fun. So shall we start the show sure no no no no no

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.130
Hey before we start I'd like to mention

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.970
our

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:27.970
Good friends at cobit on our back this episode to sponsor this episode. Thank you cobit on

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:36.410
Love your product and for the testers listening out there if you're looking for a more affordable way to test a mobile app on a real device

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:44.010
Welcome to cobit on the complete mobile device cloud platform that gives you access to test on the latest iOS and Android devices

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.710
These are real devices also not simulated. I'm annotating as I go

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.730
But iOS and Android devices when you need them

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:58.070
For manual to automated testing cobit on is a simpler cost effective way to test your mobile app the way you want with no commitment

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.750
For only ten cents a minute. You can get a hundred minutes of testing time

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.790
That's just ten bucks for a hundred minutes and the best part is that your minutes never expire

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.830
By the minutes you need use them whenever you want add more when you're ready. It's that easy. That's kind of cool

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.390
Notice that the pricing change at the price

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:21.270
Strategy change from the last time we talked with cobit on so I'm pretty excited that there

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:25.270
It's much more aligned with a cloud story. Yeah, absolutely

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:32.830
From automatically generated activity logs to one source for your testing history cobit on gives you the tools

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:39.330
You need to find and fix issues faster empowering developers and businesses to get their products to market sooner

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:44.450
Test your mobile web and hybrid apps on all the latest devices and configurations from anywhere anytime

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.290
You can sign up for a no commitment free trial at cobit on that's k ob

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:55.330
Ito and cobit on comm whack a be testing and you can start testing in minutes now

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:01.050
Beyond the reading of the line there honestly if you are if you're making a mobile app

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.520
You have to use something like cobit on

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.420
Agree there's just no way. I was just briefly you said if you're making a mobile app

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.930
And I'm like, you know at this point in time. Why aren't you making a mobile app?

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.730
If you're making an app, why is it not a mobile app?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.640
SQL server through a mobile version. That's not an app. Okay. What okay? All right

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:36.140
It's an application. It's a server application. Are we gonna spend the rest of the episode head? Yes, a mantic wars. Oh god

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.380
Checking testing go

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.450
Yeah, don't don't don't turn it off not happening

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.530
I

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.850
Like that model to kind of pay as you go for a minute try stuff out one thing they don't mention in this and I hope

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.970
This is still the case. So I'm not screwing anybody up

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:58.890
But one thing I liked about cobit on is the ability to add your own devices to their cloud say I'm in my office in

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.490
Copenhagen and I plug in a bunch of Android devices

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:09.210
You can access and run tests on those from your office in Bellevue. Do you still pay 10 cents a minute?

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.620
For the cloud service, I believe actually I don't know that I should I shouldn't have gone down that rabbit hole cuz I don't know

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.870
But I remember that feature from last time we talked about them. I really liked that idea

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.830
The other thing about cobit on is it's free when work pays for it

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:37.340
It's a I think it's a no-brainer investment I do too I would I if I were in this space

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.420
I don't think I would have much

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.060
struggle

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.940
Articulate the articulating the no not at all. All right, cool

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.620
Thank you cobit on and I'll put the information up on

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.620
the website when we published this podcast

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.060
We actually do have a few topics to get to 20 minutes later

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.280
I

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.400
Posted on our slack team

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.780
Yep when I was in San Francisco, I've been

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:17.100
Making day trips to San Francisco every once in a while it for interviews mostly my ads team is completely full now

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.920
Nice still got a few openings and analytics for if you know anybody in San Francisco

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.420
I'm looking for sort of a tech lead type person

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.080
To be well to be a technical leader for the analytics and data platform team

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.960
They had to be based in San Francisco happy based in San Francisco

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.950
That is a challenge for some

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:46.550
Want I'm looking for someone not necessarily a coder or a full-time coder an NS debt type person for that team to do

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:51.750
I didn't mean this to be a recruiting post. Yes. I have two more openings in San Francisco

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.870
I'm excited to get get a full a full team down there

00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:01.550
other one is someone who could look at an analytics and data platform solution everything from collection to dashboard and

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.630
Sort of look at the end to end and figure out like imagine

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.930
What would I'm thinking in my head? It's like super st. E

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.890
But you have to be a little bit more technical then you'd think it you'd think when you say st

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.290
E but I don't need someone to slowly to write a bunch of code for those things for someone to

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:26.190
Just coordinate what's going on with that whole system and making sure that the right stuff's being done

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.130
No, I don't I want someone to look at the st. E roll

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:38.430
Because they're not probably won't be writing code all the time as most of our s debts do what I want someone to do is

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.870
get the whole big picture of end-to-end from collection to developer dashboard and

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.390
Make sure that we're doing the right things all the way through that

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:54.550
So the the industry title for what you're looking for is called a data engineer. That's what I want

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.550
Yeah, I want a data engineer

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.790
damn industry in their titles

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:06.150
Titles don't matter anyway. Yeah, what was I talking about? Oh, I was down there for a trip and I was

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:12.730
Thinking I was reflecting on a meeting I had a few days before and I was trying to teach a team how to do

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:19.370
Logging effectively because they were what they're playing what I call Jeopardy where they looked at what they're logging already

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.890
the answers and trying to figure out what questions they could answer and

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:32.840
There was a product manager in the room trying to figure out trying to answer some specific questions and a dev manager

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.480
trying to

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.100
Figure out how we could answer them without needing to add any more locking

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.850
and

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.850
We use or are using I do that all of

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.850
And honestly, I find it fun

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:54.450
I I found a little fun too because I feel like oh my god, I can provide value. I can provide value

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.370
I can provide value. I

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.650
Forget the author. Maybe you remember

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:05.690
The name of the book is how to measure any Hubbard Hubbard. He's my hero one of my heroes

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.640
Yeah, and there's a couple principles that he puts in

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.720
that I just find

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.820
inspiring

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:21.020
Is I guess the right word I think of it all the time and it's one of them is

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.620
You have already more data than you need. Yep

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.500
Another one that I'm gonna completely murder

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.420
which is

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.760
if you

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.000
Again, I don't even remember how he phrased it which is better than what I'm about to say

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.440
If you look at the same data or the same data

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.280
carries more

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.850
information

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.690
Then you are realizing sure

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:58.130
There is a there's a project that that I am working on how to speak to it

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.420
carefully

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.100
I'm about to

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.020
roll out

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.900
in Azure, I'll call it a

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.090
BFD

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.560
I'm about to roll out a game changer and I

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.300
implemented this there is one

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.330
data feed that I have

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.440
that we started with and

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.240
This data feed gets transformed into a different feed

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:35.400
It's not enriched within the other feed. It's just first at a feed we transform it into a different feed

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:41.180
then we transformed that into a different feed and

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:48.730
that third one into a different feed and I sit back and I go

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.810
I'll go now Hubbard was right previously of good the guy who wrote that book was right

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.770
that if you just look at the same data in a different way and

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.490
Continuously do it you end up building new knowledge into the data

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:13.490
I think you need a level of data maturity to be able to just even be in a position where you can discover that that is beyond

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:22.930
Data data aware for sure and we're sort of in that data aware point trying to get and we are now with our common

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:28.290
Data platform getting to a place where we can have queryable queryable results

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.970
Just at a point where we can start stretching out of data aware. So I'm really excited about that

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.610
So let me play a little game with you. Okay, your team builds dashboards and things right?

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.650
Among many other things wrong game. So how do you how do you measure?

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.370
active users on yours on your

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.890
product

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:53.490
Like what are switch product? I'm just trying to think of like Azure or my dashboard because one your dashboard

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.770
so I want to just it's just a this is the

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.630
our

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.910
Sample of the thought experiment I went through in this meeting that I that I posted about so what are some what are some factors?

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:09.150
What are the things you need to measure to know how many active users are on your site?

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.150
You can speak abstractly if you want not even about your site. How do you measure?

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:19.090
I took my dashboard. So I think I told you before that anytime I build a presentation stack I instrument it

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.670
So I'm not answering my question yet. So an active user

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.590
will be a

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.590
combination of

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.070
Frequency and repeatability. These are the

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.130
the two main

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.930
Criteria, okay. So how often do they when they when they use the site?

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:49.730
Frequency is when they use the site. How often do they use it or how long is it duration? No, think of it

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:57.290
So duration could be it like session analysis is often done if you want to think about it in a generic fashion

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:03.850
Since my most of the sites I'm building are intended to be session based. Okay fine

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.570
It'll be much more of a request response. So how many requests?

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:14.130
Okay, when so when they look at it, how many requests is it serving? Okay, and then repeatability

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:18.570
Do they come back on different days? How often do they come back? Okay, that's just two things very easy

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:24.410
And so my point was at this point was maybe there's some more factors to for different applications

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:30.010
The brief little light bulb I had was when trying to figure out what to instrument

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.290
and also knowing that we're just finally getting our queer our

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:40.090
Query based solution in place. We could query the back ends very easy and we had that at Microsoft with Azure analytics

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.370
No internally as Cousteau

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.930
We write a little anyone can write a little sequel ish query and get information. So I my

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.690
My little light bulb was oh you could just think of write the query

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.170
That would get you the data you want

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.930
before you even instrument anything so select, you know from all users where

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.330
Frequency is you know X and and repeatability is X and

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:12.290
That would give you your number of quote active users. And if those things aren't instrumented you go add the instrumentation fill that query works

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:19.220
Yeah, so and again, it's not the it's not the solution for how to do instrumentation

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:26.060
But I brought it up because there are anyone that's ever gone down this path of beginning to add

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:33.980
Analytics to their code. They tend to fall into the there's a there's a common anti pattern they fall into which is oh

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.860
We're doing instrumentation. I'm thinking of my time in Windows. Let's instrument everything and

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.130
Brandt what happens when you get when you instrument everything?

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:53.120
Number one you blow your storage stacks number two. No one uses it because I wanted you to use the term data puke. Oh

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:58.310
No, you you don't get data puke in this case because no one uses it

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.110
Because there's too much data that no one can ever handle it when when um

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.650
so

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.040
Xbox I

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.560
was

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.040
As best as I can tell the first

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.460
Team to do any sort of data analysis on the Xbox dashboard

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.770
So this was just before you joined Xbox team and

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:32.260
It was long long time ago it was so important that

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.860
We allocated a full half of a person to work on this

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.100
Wow critical yeah and

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:49.500
But the PM's the PM's had gone through you know typical I produce a functional spec and

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:56.380
I this is prior to my history, but they had learned that adding

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.500
instrumentation was a required part of the functional spec and

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.680
So PM's dutifully would add the instrumentation

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.880
devs dutifully would implement the instrumentation and

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.840
Then no one would use any of it. Yep. So when my guy joined

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.760
Or sort of working on this

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.580
Like there was just data data

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.420
Everywhere data data everywhere data and they're in far tested it he he

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:33.360
He spent a good two months just getting the first thing working

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.980
Just thinking about that makes my blood pressure go back up. Yeah, I'm

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.900
So here is the challenge though, and there are different schools to thought on this

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:50.390
There is use my method to just instrument where you need to answer your questions and nothing else and then there's everything

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:57.510
The argument against everything you've already given you can't figure out what to do the argument against approach like mine is

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:05.640
That answers your questions, but you lose and you go back to Hubbard's quote on this you may lose some

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.520
Avenues for some exploration on things you didn't know you may need to measure

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.200
Yeah, the order and I'm kind of in that camp or like measure the things that answer your questions

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.840
Plus a select few other things as long as you can do it in moderation

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.800
But you've done this more than I have what's your strategy? What's a?

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.200
How do you choose what to instrument?

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.810
so

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.610
first and foremost, let me go back because because it kind of seems to me that

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:42.290
We're trying to connect the dots here like you connected in the slack channel. Hey

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:48.490
Logging and TDD these things could probably get together and come up with something useful

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:56.690
query driven instrumentation QDI the other thing though that it realized that I realized that there's a

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.770
Possible connection what to do with it. I haven't closed on yet

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:09.100
But aren't these two models similar to sort of a generalist and a specialist I hadn't thought about that

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.100
Please elaborate. Well, so the

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:20.230
The instrument everything seems like you're just dumping a bunch of generalized data

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.710
But you haven't added enough

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.650
Something precision accuracy

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.060
information usefulness

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.140
right

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.260
So you don't you don't know what goal you're going after therefore?

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:43.360
It's gonna be a roll of a dice as to whether or not that thing goes after goal the specialist side of it though

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.290
Right if you start with the questions up front

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.810
Then it can only answer those questions

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.810
And then you're it's just a matter of time

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.210
Unless you spend a lot of time up front

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:05.410
Pre testing your questions like there's a good chance that you're gonna get burned by the orders of ignorance

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.690
That's exactly what I'm saying. I think they're how do you get past?

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:15.490
How do you find what is the right happy medium? And then the other the other actual problem on the on the question approach is

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:26.660
What happens when answering the question times out because a lot of the times you only need the answer once

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.400
Right, there's there's sort of repeatable what we call

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
operationalized

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.720
Analytics plus there's sort of ad hoc or exploratory analytics

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.280
That you don't need to to repeat

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.040
So on the logging thing of the share

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.720
From my experience is really you want to go after what are the use cases?

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.780
first and foremost

00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:01.330
I if I encourage dev to say okay if a customer comes in

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.970
Right dev you need to log

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.670
those

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.270
things that are diagnostic in nature

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.700
Log those things so that we can figure out what the problem is I

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:22.160
Have found that in my experience. I can take those diagnostic logs that is useful for dev to

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.360
Diagnose and then I can add

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.800
Information on top of it to make that data stream serve my purposes

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.250
now on the

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.770
Hypothesis or not the hypothesis though the

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.930
The other model I have questions that I want to answer

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:47.730
I actually formed up a an approach that I think

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.050
Potentially aligns with the CIRA

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.090
Stuff we serious collect inform

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.010
Recommend act. Yeah, so

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.890
We want to if we if we want to

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:06.190
Create a system where we're collecting informing recommending acting

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.510
How do we build that so the model that I've written up?

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:13.150
I

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:17.870
Call it hypothesis testing in a nutshell. It really

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.110
isn't hypothesis testing

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.930
But it starts off with a hypothesis

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:30.670
So if you go look at any sort of stats 101 you'll see that it's not hypothesis testing

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.830
There you need sort of control experiment a B

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.240
but what I tell people to do is

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.920
in a nutshell number one come up with a statement not a question a

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.360
statement that you want to prove or disprove so

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.720
You talked about users

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:59.410
You could say this feature change will increase

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.120
Verality by at least 15%

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.900
Yes, and actually I've taken that exact approach when doing

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.020
Experimentation or a B testing like or I've asked like for every feature

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:20.300
New feature we're adding that you add instrumentation to measure the business or customer value of that. Yes

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.540
so what I what but what it is important that you start off with a

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:32.820
Belief statement, this is what we believe to be true. Why is that more important than asking the question?

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.820
How does that work better than asking the question?

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.820
How much

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:43.110
How much will this improve because you can answer the question and

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:51.480
So if I make a statement it'll increase by 15% and it only does 12% right

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:58.900
Is my statements false, but maybe the maybe the experiment was successful maybe

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:04.030
likewise if you said I believe it's going to increase it by

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.590
15% but your question is

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.950
Does it increase it and it's an increase is 2%

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:18.450
You're really what the reason why I say start off with a set

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.010
statement explicitly is

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:27.790
So that you don't get stuck into an endless cyclical loop because it could come back and you can go

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:29.920
All right, 2%

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.960
now when you get that 2% someone's gonna look at that and say and judge is that good enough or not and

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.380
Whether subconsciously or consciously that's gonna wind back to their statement of belief

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:48.680
I get you so I'm saying write it up first. All right. Okay, go on after you have the statement

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:55.550
Then what you want to do is you want to enumerate if that statement were true

00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:01.690
What actions would I take and if that statement were false what actions would I take?

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:07.770
So what I'm when I'm helping people to do is a model for thinking through their their data

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.730
So you have this statement of belief now you enumerate what actions would I take?

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:20.610
Whether or not this the statement proves true or false. So that's I like that but I think

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.560
I think it puts a good

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.080
puts a good amount of thinking on the the product manager the project manager trying to come up with those things because

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.080
If I make a statement this will increase by 15%

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.640
Mm-hmm, and I actually what happens if it's true or false

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:44.280
And do we pull the feature back what I mean to have to make a commitment there, right is a

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.480
difficult thing to do but it's

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.280
Maybe good to think about that before it becomes a reactionary decision

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:58.020
And this is why I said this is a lines with Sierra right the very last thing in Syria is act

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.720
So here it's forcing you to think through

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.740
What are the actions that you would take what are you driving towards?

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.900
Far too often with the data space what we see is a bunch of people dumping a bunch of data and then

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.980
Exploring a bunch of stuff and not

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:22.640
You know sort of wandering aimlessly in the data desert. All right, so I like that

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.920
Make a method of what wandering aimlessly in the data desert. Yes

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.320
Now recommend

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:38.340
So we have a statement that we have an enumeration of actions and

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.120
So for example my prior statement

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:47.280
If we add this feature, it'll increase for ality by 15%

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.120
Obviously one action we could take is no op

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:59.330
Right if it proves true no op another action if it proves true could be

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.950
To go

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.950
More in on this feature

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.080
Right. I mean, we're making up a feature here. Sure

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:19.460
It's similarly on on if it proves false, right? We could cut the feature we could do nothing we could

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:30.790
Investigate variants of the feature that would change now the point of the question the next phase is

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.590
Is

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:37.310
Now we need to enumerate the minimum number of questions necessary

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.720
to confidently

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.320
Select the correct action. Ah

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.480
Oh, okay

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:55.280
And that's sort of the recommendation phase because what you're what you're doing now is you're saying now from a stats point of view like

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.720
Hey, there's a 75% chance that this is the correct action

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.760
There is a

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:09.440
34 percent chance that this is the correct action that the percentages do not need that up to a hundred

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:17.490
In this case that statement reminded me of and if you haven't read how to measure anything the Hubbard book

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.850
I found it fascinating. I've actually read it twice now and there's still parts

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.230
I don't understand if he knows more about math than I do

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:29.850
But the idea one other idea in there is idea of building up a confidence level

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:34.770
Yeah, versus being a hundred percent sure anything for estimates. It's like Brent

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:41.720
What year was Mount Rushmore carved? Yeah, you don't know

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.440
1937 so yeah, but oh

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:54.360
Give me an age give me a range where you are 100% confident where it was where it was carved

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.890
You say between 1900 1980. I'm a hundred percent

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.890
You

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.410
1850 to

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:07.890
1950 sure and then you can and 90% you can narrow that down then they're actually online

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.410
There are versions of the confidence game. Are you trying to come up with?

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:17.770
Where you get better at estimating within a range of things? Yes, like and

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.520
All kinds of like things you wouldn't know without looking up

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.840
But you can come up with a range where where are you a hundred percent confident in?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.440
Where this could happen and you can train yourself to like I don't know for sure

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.280
But I'm 100% between X and X. I actually used that technique

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:42.880
I'm glad that you brought that up because I use that technique for for a couple of years in my last team, but I

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.990
Wasn't too happy about my last team. So I'd repressed

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:52.190
It appears I repressed more than I really wanted to from that

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:57.430
Now let me just finish off this. No, no, sir. Go let me finish so

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.230
now we enumerate

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.630
the questions that will allow us to confidently select the action and

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:11.920
Then the last bit I think very much aligns with what you're saying is okay

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:18.720
What data do we have what additional data do we need to be able to answer these questions?

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.790
It does occur to me that that kind of

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.310
implements

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.230
CIRA in some

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.230
fashion

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:33.710
One of the things that I like to do when it comes to almost all tooling or all models is you design it from the top

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.150
Down and you build it from the bottom up

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:41.870
So if you design the what I'm calling the hypothesis model is sort of the data design

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:49.930
Then your implementation would follow the CIRA model, which is building it from the bottom up. Yeah

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.640
Go very happy with it

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.920
Cool. I'm gonna keep that in mind might be worthwhile for me to formalize that more. Yeah, so

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.940
I'm excited that on my teams that were

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.260
Getting to this stage where we can start implementing something like this and start

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.740
using data in a more

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.780
Mature 21st century, maybe want to call it a matter like like I think where we need to go

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.880
In a team I'm gonna ask for free advice from from Brent here

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.120
in a team like mine where we are

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.440
Coming out of data aware into a higher level of data maturity

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:37.250
What are some other key bits of advice you would give a team in that stage? I think now is a very good time

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.450
to

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.450
So first and foremost you cannot over hit

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.650
action ability

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.550
You cannot

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:52.110
Make that a rallying cry too much

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.240
In along those lines right really start to introduce them to

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.200
actionable versus vanity metrics

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.910
so the first thing is they're gonna start pulling these numbers in and

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:14.870
The next thing you're gonna see is a bunch of new dashboards with with data puke and vanity metrics. Yep. And

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.020
guaranteed

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:24.260
At them on the back for for for bringing visibility where didn't exist before

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:30.000
But hit them hard and hit them early on

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.040
action ability. I already have smoke alarms inherently in place for

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.160
for data puke and vanity metrics

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.520
the other common thing that I see is

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:44.330
on

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.330
the topic of accuracy

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:55.240
How important is it to be accurate and I will tell you at this phase

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.600
Not at all

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.080
Not at all not at all

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:06.320
You want to elaborate with an example? Yeah, it's actually one of my favorite ways to torture data scientists

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.240
Because they're they are

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.600
Episode on on Brent's entire list of ways to torture data scientists

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.760
so data scientists get trained and

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.120
It's an important skill set but they're they are trained to work through

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.630
accuracy of their models now and a

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:37.360
Life-site model or in any AI model worth its salt accuracy is important

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.560
But when you're first starting this stuff

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.080
You're not using it for that. You're using it to provide recommendations

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.720
as well as as

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.200
What I call Pareto ordering of the actions so you can think of

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.200
The action list as as also

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.520
Another way of providing it is not selecting which action to take

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.840
but ordering

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.840
Sometimes the actions that you could take you could take multiple of them

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.240
So which one's gonna have the highest impact now data scientists they want accuracy and

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.020
But I will tell you

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.420
getting to three nines of accuracy

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.800
Or no getting to four nines from three nines is

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.150
an order of magnitude

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.710
of course amount of work, yeah, it's

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.010
As you tighten and tighten and tighten and tighten

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:36.410
It's each each step is another order of magnitude worth of work

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:41.210
No, and that makes sense if you're getting into being data driven and data centric

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.870
that

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.880
The information you get is going to guide you in the right direction

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:53.440
Maybe not exactly where you need to go and then as you hone in and get more mature

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.480
It's gonna take a while before you actually get that sort of pinpoint navigation you need

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.960
So in the initial phases right an actionable metric

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:10.000
There's really two high level classes and that's either a rate or a ratio

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.170
Okay, and these are directional

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:23.160
It says go in this direction go in that direction and the accuracy of the numerators and the denominators

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.160
generally

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.160
Don't matter at the beginning phases

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:33.320
No, that makes complete sense and the one of the things again that I use to torture the data scientists

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.220
This is all awesome. You can pretend to be the data scientists in this little skit

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.880
Hey Alan. Hey, Brett

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:45.960
I hear you really want to make this more accurate. I do I'm working hard on it great

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:50.480
It's my it's my life. Let me ask you so we already have a list

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.590
That orders the actions we're going to take. Yeah

00:45:55.190 --> 00:46:01.350
So let me ask you this if we spend the next three months on improving the accuracy here

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.230
Is that gonna change the order? No, but I'll justify my job

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:13.450
Yeah, you actually won't because you'll have wasted three months when you could have been doing something useful, oh, yeah shit

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:21.900
Yeah, so that's actually if it doesn't change the the order now there will be so I tell them and very open

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:28.690
As an open discussion because I if I do expect them to say yeah, I think it would if it would

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:31.560
but generally when you when

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.240
When you look at the ordering, it's almost always a head tail curve

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.440
Which means the number one action?

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:46.170
Even with another two years of accuracy the number one action would still be the number one action

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:53.090
Yeah, right. So at that point in time, I'm like look it's time to move on to something else. We'll come back to this

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.050
when

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.370
Accuracy would change the order. Sure. Sure and I can see that as

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:01.810
That is just an increased level of maturity

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.570
Honestly, if we can get to where we're getting

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.080
some direction

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.120
from

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:16.320
Data. Mm-hmm. I'm pretty happy then over time that can become more precise but

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.780
Ballpark, I'm happy. I would recommend that you try out the the model and I'm talking about and get

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.560
Of course I will management thinking through what actions we would take. Yeah for sure. I

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.910
Can't emphasize this enough. You cannot

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.760
Beat the drum of action ability too much

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.630
You just simply cannot it it trumps everything

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:46.150
Got it. Yep. Good advice

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:51.750
Well, thank you. Thank you for all that shall we call it a day? Yes anything else?

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.330
Okay, everyone. I'm

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:59.050
Alan I think and I am Brent. We'll see you next time. Thank you
