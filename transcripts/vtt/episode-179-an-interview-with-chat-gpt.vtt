00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
However, it is important to note that the principles do not suggest that testers are not necessary

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040
at all. Rather that expanding the team's abilities and know how may reduce the need

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.760
for dedicated specialists, which is spot fricking on.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.240
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.280
will be here to guide you through topics on testing.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.680
Brent's in a sample different these times.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.160
Not because Brent is going through any sort of life changing event.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.400
Just using his earbuds instead of his normal headset.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.360
There should be good news, far less breathing for me to edit out.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.760
Although I am getting really good at seeing the breathing in the audio formats.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.240
So that's good, but it doesn't sound as good.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.760
I'll see what I can tweak out.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.160
But welcome to the AB testing podcast, Brent.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.960
Thank you. I've been here quite a while.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.560
Wait, you're saying that you now know what my breathing looks like?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.000
I can recognize your breathing in its audio stream format, yes.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.880
Fun.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.560
I just, I don't even listen to it to make sure it's breathing before I delete it.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.160
I just, I just delete it.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.280
Hey, since we, since, uh, this is the AB testing podcast,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.440
I have, and I know you like using Dolly, right?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.240
Yep. I use Dolly every week. If you read, uh, shameless plug, angry weasel.substack.com.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.360
I've been doing a weekly post for the last several months

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.840
and, uh, every week it is decorated with a picture generated by Dolly.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.840
I am sorry for the artists who I'm putting out of business by using

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.400
AI to generate my cover art for my massively, not massively read.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.080
And this podcast has three listeners.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.760
My blog has two readers.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.200
And so they get a free picture.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.920
I'll, I'll make up for it in a future life.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.840
Anyway, yes. I'm familiar with Dolly.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.000
So my, my, my daughter is quite an artist and they,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.320
she expressed a game with that her, her friends had made up.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.520
And it was a game of what does your artwork taste like?

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.670
Okay.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.510
Right. It's in the art world.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.750
I did some other inspiring emotions.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.350
And so doing that literally went to your artwork.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.230
Like if you looked at the art and you like, okay, can you imagine what that might taste like?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.390
And then I responded, well, I knew what my artwork tastes like.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.390
And she's like, what I said, aluminum foil.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.030
She's never chewed aluminum foil.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.310
So she doesn't, hasn't yet learned the phenomenon around

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
electrical conductivity and why it feels weird.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.750
But I spent a good hour trying to get Dolly to,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.990
to come up with its own expression of what,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.470
what a chewing aluminum foil might be in terms of an abstract art.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.740
And it just, how would you do it?

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.180
What would be your prompt?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.700
I don't think it can.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.780
And anytime, one thing for us to remember, we're going to talk about this in a bit.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.180
I have a potentially lengthy chat GPT segment to go over today.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.140
As I once again, design the agenda,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.460
you have to keep in mind the data it was trained on.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.090
And it was trained on just a bunch of pictures with some metadata around them.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.450
So it gets an idea of what things are across hundreds of thousands, if not millions of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.090
different pieces of art and photos, et cetera.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.810
I'm going to guess millions and millions actually, now that I say it out loud.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.250
So I don't know what prompt I'd give it.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.850
I would, it wouldn't know the aluminum.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.960
So I would show, show me a picture of a man chewing with small sparks coming out of his mouth.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.640
No, I don't want an image of it.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.560
You want to know what Dolly thinks it's art tastes like?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.000
No, I want it to create an abstract.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.760
So imagine an abstract painting with the title, chewing aluminum.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.960
This is where Dolly is going to struggle because while it knows what abstract is,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.990
but unless it's going to be trained on the metadata around that abstraction.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.870
So if the abstract piece of art is called, if it's a white painting of two polar bears

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.470
fighting in a snowstorm, it's not really going to get it.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.150
It it's very, as you know, generative AI is very, very logical.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.950
Yes.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.430
And you would have to not describe the aluminum.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.470
So one thing I learned in studying and what you were getting at earlier and

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.310
what does your art taste like is art is the reaction to the medium that was created by the artist.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.110
I'm very adamant about this and I fight with my daughter about it sometimes too.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.390
So so what is your art tastes like is a totally reasonable question for how

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.150
what does the art mean?

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.910
What does your art mean to you?

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.110
So if I'm going to prompt Dolly, there's no way I all I can do is prompt it for my reaction

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.590
because I have to tell Dolly to generate something that is a representation of my interpretation.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.950
If I want to sort of reverse engineering art.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.790
So if I want my reaction, if I've already stated at the end, I'm working backward,

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.710
it's kind of like TDD for art.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.150
My reaction is I want to feel like I'm chewing on aluminum.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.420
I have to give it a prompt.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.660
I have to think like what kind of art would make me feel that way.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.420
And you know that because you said it's your art.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.780
You could describe your art.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.740
But what's interesting in the general sense is I could decide my art tastes like sour lemon

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.900
or no, I shouldn't say my art.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.940
I would I could start with this art that I haven't yet thought of tastes like sour lemon.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.220
And then I'd have to reverse engineer and go backward and think

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:09.020
what medium, what sort of impression would have to be made on me for me to think of sour lemon.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.180
And then I would want to give Dolly some input to create that.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:23.260
So I would say, give me an abstract piece of art using lots of yellow and using lots of yellow

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.420
and converging patterns.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.950
And then it would give that to me.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.430
And I could see if it had the if I had the reaction that it really is TDD.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.630
We're doing it backward.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.070
I could see if I had the reaction.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.710
I went out for it.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.590
They know it's not quite it.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.150
I could tweak it.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.110
I could try something else.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.870
But okay, that's the way I would approach that.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.230
Okay.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.030
Yep.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.670
There's a bunch of things like I think I don't know if I've ever shared this with you

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.870
or on the podcast.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:59.630
So back in the day, are you familiar with the bird known as the American kestrel?

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.670
I am not.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.390
Okay.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.790
But you are aware of birds.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.030
Yes.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.990
No.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.190
Well, maybe.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:21.180
So back in the day when I was not yet 18, I was a hacker and I went by the name, the kestrel.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.900
So if you were to go home and look up my gamer tag, you'll see kestrel was dominant.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.180
I do know that is your gamer tag.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.220
Yeah.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.340
I mean, it's other things.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.060
But kestrel is a big part of it.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:42.780
I also am a big fan of steampunk and I've been trying to get Dolly to

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:50.460
create an image of a kestrel and dress it up in some some rad ass steampunk gear.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:58.140
Yeah, it incorporates the elements correctly, but it incorporates the elements,

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.020
but never the way I want it.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:09.580
Yeah, I think what I was going to say is at some point you need to just commission an artist to do

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.980
the thing.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:15.100
I think Dolly, one of the reasons I think Dolly does not put artists out of work is because

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.540
it gets, I mean, you get what you pay for, right?

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.580
Right.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.540
It's not going to get you what you want there.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.900
It's not going to get exact.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.420
One of the listeners posted on LinkedIn this week saying, hey, I tried to get Dolly.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.660
I tried for 20 minutes to get Dolly to put words into this picture and it wouldn't do it.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.900
And of course, the answer is Dolly wasn't trained on words.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.860
He doesn't know what they are.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.940
It has no concept of words.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.060
That's not true.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.300
It makes words.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.380
It knows words contain letters.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.020
That's right.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.260
Right.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.820
It has an abstract knowledge of words.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:52.780
Yeah.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.620
If you want something specific, go commission an artist.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.420
Feed an artist.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.060
They're great.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.140
If you're a listener of the podcast, we commissioned the art for the AB testing,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.900
the orange little box and the one of the three logo, all that stuff we paid for.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.140
And also what I was going to show you is if you go to angryweasel.com,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.380
you see the weasel logo I've had there for 10 years.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.060
Same artist did that for me.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.380
And I just made, you know, I don't, I have a couple unity hoodies.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.380
I probably shouldn't wear my unity hoodies, air quote, to work to my office.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:28.380
So I now have an angry weasel hoodie with a big angry weasel logo on the back and right over the heart.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.700
Cool.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.380
So, uh, yeah, it's a novelty thing.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.780
And then the other day at the gym, I'm walking out and some like 20, 20 something year old

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.100
tapped me on the shoulder rather vigorously.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.340
I have a headphones and he goes, cool hoodie, man.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.100
And if I was quick, I should have handed him a card and said,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.180
here's where you go buy them in my shop.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.460
I don't have a shop.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.300
I yeah, I'm just not that together, but it'd be cool to start seeing people.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:53.540
Yeah.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.740
No angry weasel hoodies, angry weasel.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:57.700
Yeah.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.100
You're missing out on the hipster crowd.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.580
Yeah.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.700
I should.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.060
You do have a market there.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.420
I should just buy a bunch and give them away just for advertising.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.380
So I could go from two listeners to two readers to three readers and be as good as our podcast.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.980
Hey, speaking of LinkedIn, a couple of things happened.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.260
One, I didn't post this.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.940
I may post this on LinkedIn.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.780
It may become a blog post, but I think people would convince me of trolling.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.500
So LinkedIn is filled with a bunch of this checking versus testing stuff.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.860
And then also a lot of, and I'm gonna get to that in a second, but also still every

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.580
week I know, sigh, sigh, sigh, but I had a thought about this one.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.340
This isn't a rehash the same stuff we get mad about all the time or to trigger brand.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:49.140
It is to talk about the fact that people still are triggered, I will say, over the term manual

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.780
testing. They wouldn't, they say, I'm not going to make any mock voices right away,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:02.740
even though I just about did. Not manual. It's, it's, it's automated testing is checking or automated.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.420
How do I not do a tautology there? If it's automated, it's checking.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.540
And if I do it, it's just testing. And then I had a thought that came to me that

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:20.450
was like, they don't call it manual programming and they're right. But I wonder.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.090
They also don't call it automatic programming.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:28.320
I know they don't either. And I, I think the thing is, I think if you look at it from a different

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.480
angle, what if we lived in a world where I mean, it's about putting a label on something to show

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:42.000
how it differs from the common. And if the common form of testing is automated testing,

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.170
when we talk about testing, we're talking about some form of automation,

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:53.890
you would have to use the modifier manual to let you know, typically testing is automated,

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.130
but in this instance, I'm talking about doing it in a non-automated fashion.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.910
And I wonder if there's some of that from history, you know, and in the big scheme,

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.110
I don't care, but I had a little fleeting thought. I was trying to figure it out.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.110
Something was there. I wanted to bring it up before I forgot, but I'm just going to leave that.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:16.750
I don't think, I don't think anyone automated versus manual. And it comes to this topic.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:22.350
No one's really disputing the meaning between automated and manual.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.390
What they're saying is manual testing is redundant, right?

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.110
Yes, but it is, but it isn't. The modify, it's not redundant.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:37.070
The modifier is there to let you know, again, they see it, the people against it,

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:43.550
see it as a attack on testing in some way. And I don't want to get into this because honestly,

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.310
I don't really give a shit, but I just want, I just had this thought, like,

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.590
I wonder if we put the manual modifier on for a reason, not to degrade.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.390
It's actually for a good reason. Also along those lines,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.510
I don't want to spend a bunch of time on this, but also along those lines,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.710
there was another, you know, someone posted, I'm not even going to go into names.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:10.590
Someone posted something on automated checking and our friend Jason who both loves us and hates us.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:15.150
Hi, Jason. I think he loves us more than he hates us. Sometimes he pissed him off though.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.230
He pushed back a little bit and something about, you know, he pushed back on the checking

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.470
versus testing thing, but he took part in the conversation really well. And then at the very

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.750
end, well, the law, the source of confusion is some people don't realize that automation

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.430
isn't just for reproducing user flows. And we talked about this last time of the time before,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:38.590
when I got really mad about people just stop, stop writing automation to reproduce workflows.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.710
And Jason heard that and he liked it. I said, I described it well,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.630
and simply on the recent podcast. So thanks Jason for that call out. So you can go back and find

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.030
that one. And then he also asked if there's any chance we can get Michael Bolton on the

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:55.070
podcast and I'm going to go a hard no on that one. Yeah. With you.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:00.750
All right. Just, just don't have it. I mean, I'll do respect to what you do. You do you,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:06.750
but it's just not going to jive well with. I honestly think that I think the conversation

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:15.740
around checking versus testing has exceeded its quota on our podcast probably years ago.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.620
Oh God. Yes. Oh God. Yes. So.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:26.000
Just to make it even worse, I think about, okay, a COVID test. Okay. It's not called a COVID check.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.220
It's called a COVID test. Right. And I would argue it is chemically automated. Right. So.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:43.420
Yeah. To me, it is just, it is nasal. It's semantic BS in, in, that's it.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.900
Okay. We're going to move on because we talked about that enough. Everybody knows

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.220
our stance on that. You can go to one of the three dot slack.com. I need to update the link.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:57.580
If you, uh, cause there was a time when slack used to give you an in perpetuity,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:03.940
I can't pronounce that word, a forever working link for signing up for the slack group. They

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.940
stopped doing that. I either, I didn't read the mail or they didn't tell me, but now it expires

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.820
every month and I realized I forgot to update it. So it's like, it's currently broken. I'm going

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:18.050
to wrap myself a note and I'm going to fix it after the podcast or tomorrow. There we go.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.450
Everything I remember to do, I write down in to do this. That's a free plug for to do is to do us.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:27.410
If you want to sponsor the podcast, that's great. Uh, so anyway, one of the three dot slack.com.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.090
You can ping us there, ask us questions, take part in the community, pretty vibrant community.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.330
There are lots of stuff going on. We love you. Brent, it is time to introduce our guest.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.850
We have a guest.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.370
We do have a guest. Someone we have talked about a lot on the podcast.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:50.050
Someone very influential in my life. Someone I talk with every single day is probably one of my

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:55.330
strongest collaborators over the last month. Brent, I'd like to introduce you to my friend.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:04.660
Chat GPT. Yeah, I have. We haven't talked about your buddy in such a long time.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:10.820
So what I did this week, and I'm going to give you the highlights for this is actually

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.980
going to be an interview with chat GPT, but we're going to comment on the interview.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.540
Because it's kind of interesting and worth talking about because again, I'm going to say this again.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:28.340
I think 90 plus person used to be 99 down to 90% of the people using chat GPT and similar bots

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.940
are trying to use them wrong. Stop asking them questions that have a binary answer.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.860
Chat GPT is very, very bad at math, not even close bad at math. I even had it help me write

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:45.460
a program, which generally it's good at. Logical programs, very good at. I tried to have it write

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.580
me a program to help me with a math problem I was trying to solve. I'm going to go over that

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:54.900
in a second and it failed completely. It is absolutely dumb at math. Do not ask it math

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.940
questions. You could ask, but the kind of questions you can ask it like exploratory questions.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.900
There's that E word people love. Very, very good. Just real quick tangent. There's this new

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.420
beta game out of the New York Times called digits. I do the New York Times crossword.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.620
Four to five days a week, depending on, I can't do any more than that.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.940
Cause I'm just not smart enough. I do Wordle. I do this new game called digits where you're

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.500
given a set of six digits and you can use any of the basic for math.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.000
Jesus operators. Oh my God to come up with this target number and there's three a day

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.920
or three or five a day and they get, they get harder as they go along. And I thought,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.880
you know what? This is fun, but it would be fun to try and write a solver.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.820
Okay. And so I asked chat GPT to help me and it was utterly hopeless. I tried to,

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.300
like, I really tried to coach it to do it. It could not do it. I ended up writing it in Python.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.180
It's pretty cool, but I still try. I still try and do them by hand. Uh, but I wrote a little

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:57.380
solver in Python. So, uh, but open ended questions are great. So what I did is I led,

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.300
I said, here are a set of principles that I believe help with software development.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.540
And I gave it the modern testing principles, but the more recent version, which isn't,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.860
which takes out testing completely. So I'll read them real quick for context. Um,

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:14.100
our priority is improving the business. We use models like lean thinking and theory of constraints

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.660
to help identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system. So far the same. We are a force

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.460
for continuous improvement and adapt and optimize our practices in order to succeed rather than using

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.900
safety nets to catch our failures. We believe that the customer, sorry, sorry, we care deeply

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.660
about the quality culture of the team and we coach lead and nurture each other towards a more

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.300
mature quality culture. We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.100
evaluate the quality of our product. We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.780
and then close the gaps between product hypothesis and business impact. And finally, we expand

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.900
abilities and know how across the team, understanding that this may reduce or eliminate the need for

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.460
dedicated specialists. Those of you that have grown up with the principles over the last five

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.300
or six years, we came out with them. You probably listened to those and go, are those different?

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.460
They're slightly different. We've removed the word tester from them to make them more general.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:11.540
They're modern develop, modern delivery practices, what they are really. So I gave it those and it

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:17.730
replied. It said, I didn't even ask. It just said, I hear a set of principles I believe help

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:23.650
with software development paced. It said these principles are focused on continuous improvement,

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.930
quality culture and customer satisfaction. The author, I'll put authors, the authors

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.730
emphasizes the use of lean thinking and theory of constraints to identify bottlenecks and improve

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.890
the business. The principles also stress the importance of using data to understand customer

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:42.210
usage and the need to expand abilities and knowledge across the team. So in this case,

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:47.010
all it's doing is summarizing, which chat GPT is very good at. One thing you can do, you can

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.050
ask chat GPT, summarize this book, and it will give you too high level of a summary. Here's my

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:58.290
hot tip. If you want a good summary of a book, ask chat GPT to give you a summary of each

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.970
chapter of a book and you get a wonderful freaking walkthrough. Free tips, free tips,

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.290
I'll charge for them later. So nothing, nothing exciting here, nothing for you to chime in on.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:14.110
In terms of writing style, the author's tone is confident and assertive with a focus on

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.990
concise language and clear messaging. The principles are presented in a logical and

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.630
organized manner with a strong emphasis on actionable steps for improving software development

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.470
processes. Chat GPT thinks we know what we're doing. So I'm a little, a little against this.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.790
I'm like, I'm like actionable.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.910
All right, Brett, I want you to just hold on to your ego. Don't let it rise up because chat

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:42.590
GPT will blow smoke up your ass like nobody else. I know. Oh yeah. Similar authors might include

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:48.350
business and management writers such as Peter Drucker or Clayton Christensen, who also emphasized

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:52.590
the importance of continuous improvement and adapting to change in order to achieve business

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:58.670
success. We are not even in the same league who sees a league who sees a league that may

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.070
see a league that knows those two. We're not even the parents of the little league kids.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:11.330
So that's, you know, that, that part's all kind of a bullshitty, but then I can ask it some

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.850
questions and here's where we get a chance to comment. I asked, are there any improvements you

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.970
would suggest? Okay. These principles seem like a good, and again, it's hard to get it to

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.410
really have an opinion. You have to kind of work at it for a while. So it gets better as we go

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.970
along. These principles seem like a good starting point for guiding software development. However,

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:36.770
there are a few areas that could potentially be expanded upon or clarified priority. It might be

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.170
useful to clarify what is meant by improving the business. Are there specific business goals or

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.330
metrics that the team is working towards? Defining these can help ensure that everyone is

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.330
aligned on working towards a common goal, which I kind of think is good freaking feedback.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:22:02.670
Yeah, that's right. We have had, we have seen certainly by feedback that people take sort of a

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:11.550
different view. Like when, when, when I envisioned it, it was, it was essentially, no, I want these

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:21.060
people to directly try to target revenue or profit. Yep. And then we've heard around like some,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:28.420
some, there was a podcast that people did about AB testing. Then we're talking about it. And they're

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:34.740
like, Oh yeah, it tests, test can ignore this because as we know, test is there to reduce the cost.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.670
Therefore we're improving the business. And I almost pulled over the side of the road and

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:47.070
cried because I'm like, Oh, okay. Not only were they misinterpreting it, they went 180 degrees

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.150
wrong. Yeah. And you're actually hitting on something. So hold that thought. I want to get

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.630
through as a little bit of feedback for each one, which is all actually pretty good. And

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.860
I'll hold my next thought on that till I read the next one models. It would be helpful to provide

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.820
more specific examples of how lean thinking and theory of constraints are used to identify and

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.740
prioritize bottlenecks. This can help make the principles more concrete and actionable.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:16.580
I agree with that, but is it a goal of principles to be concrete? No, no, but what

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.940
it leads to me is at some point there's in my head, these get misinterpreted and we're

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:29.780
going to go more into that in a minute, but I wonder why we've never written an accompanying paper

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.120
to probably something we should have done or should do at some point. I mean, I've talked

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.880
about them at conferences so you can go a little bit deeper in the examples or there or some of

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:45.920
them. I wrote a long ass blog post that, that accompanied it.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.720
I don't know what you're talking. Okay. Well, maybe it needs to be with them, but interesting.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.640
Interesting. I think it's good feedback. I'm not sure how to fit those into the principles, but

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.720
it made me think. And again, chat GPT is my collaborator. If I can ask it questions and

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.240
it can make me think that I'm winning. Yes. Continuous improvement. It might be helpful

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.320
to clarify what is meant by safety nets. And I think again, examples would help,

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.640
but I think our audience knows, but which actually GPT didn't know. Again,

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.880
ask for more examples, quality culture. It might be useful to expand upon what a mature

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.960
quality culture looks like, which we've done with the quality culture matrix.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.200
I'm going to pause for, get to the last three and just remind people who haven't been with us

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:36.960
on the entire journey. Brent and I spent probably the first two or three years of the podcast,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.260
just talking about how software should be developed and what was happening with testers

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:49.010
and vetting ideas and learning from each other. And then it just came to a point when,

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:57.730
in trying to capture what we had been talking about for all that time, I sketched out a first

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:03.730
draft of what eventually through lots of vetting became the modern testing principle.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.570
So it was, it wasn't like, we didn't set out to say we're going to write principles. It was like,

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:12.690
you know what? We need to capture what we've been writing out in a set of principles.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.610
If I recall correctly, you were reading some book.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.690
Dalio, the principles by Dalio, which is a great freaking book.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.210
And you just connected the dots between the two.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:29.650
Yeah. And this is why I read a lot because I'm not that smart, but I'm really good at pattern

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.650
matching. I'm really good at figuring out how to make stuff work together. That's my super power.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.810
By the way, INTP for the win, yo.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:44.610
Well, you know, I wrote last week about that INTP, but I do think I'm good at that

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.170
connecting and putting stuff together. By the way, I redid strengths finders. I have new strengths.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:54.450
Talk about sometime soon. I'm going to save those for the later customer evaluation. While it's

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:59.170
important to prioritize customer's perspective, also important to consider other stakeholders.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.490
We've got that feedback. Data usage, give examples and specialization.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.330
While it is true that cross functional teams can help reduce the need for dedicated specialists,

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:12.370
it's important to recognize there may still be areas where specialized expertise is necessary.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:15.810
Add some clarification there, which is we've talked about. Like I think security will

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.770
always need specialists. Is one example.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.970
No, if that's true anymore. Yeah.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.810
And this point, I've warmed up my friend chat GPT.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.090
Okay.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:33.250
So now I take it into, uh, I want to see what it'll do with a more introspective question.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:38.530
So I asked it, of course, which of these principles could be considered the most controversial?

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.130
Oh, fun.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:45.330
The principles listed seem to be, it's, it can, I can almost predict its writing style.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:52.270
It makes like a, Hey, these are great, but so these principles listed seem to be generally accepted

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.510
as good practices and software development. And there isn't necessarily one that stands

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:01.630
out as being particularly controversial. It talent verbal italics. Mine. However,

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:08.180
thank you, chat GPT. However, depending on the specific context and the organization's culture

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.500
and values, some of these principles may be more challenging to implement than others.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.500
For example, principle number five, which states that the customer is the only one capable of

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.380
judging and evaluating the quality of the product may be challenging for organizations

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.100
that have a history of prioritizing internal metrics and goals over customer feedback.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.160
Yeah. Okay.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.520
Yeah. We agree. Yeah. That was pretty fantastic.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.400
But it pulled out that five was controversial. And when we wrote those, we didn't, we thought

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:47.040
seven would be controversial and it went right for five. Yeah. But then it says similarly,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.520
principle seven, which suggests that the team should expand its abilities and knowledge across

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:58.080
the board rather than, rather than relying on dedicated specialists may be difficult to

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.640
implement an organization that have historically relied heavily on specialized roles.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.960
So I want to give props and a little props to chat GPT. It absolutely is. I mean,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.440
we didn't know me wrote them. We thought seven is the one people would freak out about. A lot of

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.160
people like seven. Yeah, I get this. This makes sense. It doesn't mean get it. We're going to

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.120
testers once they get over that, they kind of get it. But we didn't know five was going to be

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.840
such a hot bed. It just went right for five and said, well, watch out here. Yeah. We knew

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:35.330
about seven because that's what was the controversy when Microsoft was going through the transition.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.940
Right. We saw over and over. We didn't see anyone disagree that the customer,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.620
that one was purely because we were in a bubble. Yeah, we were. Oh, let me go back to LinkedIn

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.460
for a minute before we go back to chat GPT. Chat GPT, hold on. Can be patient for a minute.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:59.890
I was tagged in a post on LinkedIn and I just got to read this. I wouldn't even say what company

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.770
I don't know the company that tweeted it, tweeted it. I'm so caught up in the musk world. What's

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:11.340
it called when you post on LinkedIn, leaded it, linked it, linked. I don't know. They said

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:17.020
that the post is just this. Will we be able to live without software testers? Absolutely not.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.900
They make sure that the product being released is flawless.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:26.940
Without testers, all the tools would crash and burn. So follow these experts who share their

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:33.660
experience and practices with the rest of us and they tagged me. Hyperbole. Hyperbole much?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.740
I replied and said something to the effect of, I don't know what it was. Like you tagged the

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:45.740
wrong person. Like I don't know where it went. But yeah, that's, I think, I think I'm in the

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.260
wrong. I think I got tagged in the wrong post. Well, maybe it's from like a millennial or

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:58.220
something. And one of those terms, you know how like bad means good and, and, oh, yeah.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.260
Right. And maybe it's like, maybe we're just not up to date on like the new hip term. And now

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:10.540
it's been reversed. I still, you know, I'm, I'm not anti testing. I don't know that testers

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.660
should do it. I get asked a lot to write about testing or give talks on testing. And I just

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.820
just, I'm not going to, it's, it's, I haven't done that in so long.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.540
I don't know. It's, I kind of view it as something that's going to be self-resolved.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:32.980
It's there are better ways to manage risk, right? Several of the statements listed out testers make

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:38.740
your product flawless. That, that part's hyperbole. The fact they told me, the fact

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.980
they told me in a post that said testers weren't going away, which I don't agree with.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:50.180
It's funny. Let's get back to our guest. Yeah. Let's play a little game and I'll call it test

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:57.220
GPT. Okay. Mr. Chief, Mr. Jet GPT. What are some reasons that team should not adopt these

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:05.380
principles? No. Probing questions while, and again, I'm so impressed with the, what it learned

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.300
while there may, while there are many benefits to adopting these principles, there may be some

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.580
reasons why teams might want to adopt them, including one organizational culture. Some orgs

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.220
may have deeply entrenched cultures that are resistant to change and may not be receptive

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.260
to adopting new principles and ways of working. That constitutes the entire, almost the entirety

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.020
of the crowd that tell us we're dumb. What is your, what was your prompt again?

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.180
What are some reasons that teams should not adopt these principles?

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.900
Good. I think, I think it took it is that that won't. Yeah. Okay. Number two,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:42.260
short-term focus organizations that are focused solely on short-term gains and immediate profits

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.060
may not see the long-term value in investing in continuous improvement, quality culture,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:52.500
or expanding the abilities of the team. And they're right. I focus so much on the people

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.660
getting the work done. And that, you know, there's, it's not just me, a lot of people in our

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.860
circle, in our bubble focused on, we want to get the team in a place where they can deliver

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:09.730
quality at a nice velocity, a sustainable pace, all of that stuff. Yeah. If you don't care about

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.770
that, if you just want to hurry up and get shit out to customers, I guess you wouldn't want to

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:18.050
adopt them. I don't think it's new there. Number three, resource constraints. Some orgs may not

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:22.690
have the resources to invest in the necessary training tools or personnel. And that goes a lot

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:27.090
with number two. They only care about the short term. Number four, resistance from team members.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:30.930
Some team members may be resistant to change or may not want to expand their skill sets or

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:35.090
take on new responsibilities. We've heard this from a lot of people. It goes with number one a lot,

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:38.530
but that's, yeah, people are digging their heels in. They want to do what they've always been doing.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:44.370
My developers don't want to test. They shouldn't have to, because they're paid too much money to

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:49.730
test. Right. And lack of understanding some team members or stakeholders may not fully understand

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.650
the value of these principles or may not understand how they can be applied in practice.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:59.170
And these are, these all ring bells with me. So it's important for teams to carefully consider

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:03.170
their unique context and constraints before deciding whether to adopt these principles

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.410
and to be prepared to address any challenges or resistance that may arise. And I think

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:12.210
you and I are, we like living in the world of being change agents. And I think there are a lot

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:17.730
of folks who just don't want to deal with that. It's hard. It's easier just to do the thing

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:23.730
they've done and not try and do that cultural change, which we, you and I kind of love a

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:31.890
little. Well, yeah, it's the age old battle of if it ain't broke, don't fix it. That is not a

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:36.530
perspective that I generally hold. There's a question I'm going to skip. I asked it on what

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:41.090
tips you can think of for teams who want to adopt these principles. And it's just like, you know,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:46.370
pull your head out of your button before we're in a long paragraph. But so I got into two more

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.450
questions because we do, we're down to like eight minutes here or seven. I didn't stop like a

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.770
minute before four for our next meeting. What would a software tester think of these principles?

00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:00.690
Let's just get the embrace the elephant, hug the elephant, as they say. Yeah. A software tester

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:05.730
may have mixed feelings about these principles. On one hand, they may appreciate the focus on quality

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:10.530
culture and continuous improvement as those principles align with their role in ensuring the

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:15.010
quality of software being developed. They may also agree, and there's a weird one after what

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:18.930
it said before, they may also agree that the customer is the ultimate judge of quality of

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:23.090
the product. And I know people who adamantly believe that that is false. They say number

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:29.490
five is wrong. We ignore it. There's no way. And I'm blown away. Anyway, on the other hand,

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:33.730
a tester may feel concerned about the principle that suggests the dedicated specialist may not be

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:38.290
necessary. Testers may worry that their role is being diminished or eliminated, which could

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:42.210
impact their job security. However, it is important to note that the principles do not

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.850
suggest that testers are not necessary at all. Rather, that expanding the team's abilities

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:51.730
and know how may reduce the need for dedicated specialists, which is spot freaking on.

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:58.850
This is why I love chat. This is why it's my friend. And again, I'm asking an AI to interpret

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.650
this stuff. It's like, yeah, I get it completely in the way we intended. Yet hundreds or thousands

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.250
of testers read these things or developers read these things and go, whoop, that those are

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:12.210
wrong. This is stupid. Overall, a software tester may appreciate the focus on quality,

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:15.650
continuous improvement, but may have some concerns about their role in a team that adopts

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.650
these principles. It's important for teams to communicate and collaborate to ensure that

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.650
everyone's concerns are addressed, that the team may work together effectively towards a common goal.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:29.410
So what I think I may do is I may add some formatting to this and go ahead and post it

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.810
in our Slack group, people to play with and react on, because it's interesting.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:40.690
I want to do one more. I'm going to skim over. I asked it what's missing. And I think it's okay.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:45.090
They mentioned that we don't explicitly mention any particular software development

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:50.050
methodology, and that's on purpose. While the principals mentioned the importance of customer,

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.970
they did not explicitly discuss the importance of designing software with user in mind.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:58.210
I think that's beyond the principles. They don't talk about security. And again,

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:03.970
that's beyond what's in there or software architecture. So I'm okay with good callouts,

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:08.290
but I'm okay with those not being there. I asked it, what do these principles tell you about the

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:13.410
authors of the principles? And they said these two that the two authors are a couple of

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.810
blowhards that couldn't tell their ass from a hole in the ground. No, it says they care about

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:23.410
quality, blah, blah, blah. Without additional context, I can't tell you anything. That's fine.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:30.080
And the last one I asked it was this, can you think of a mission statement that would go well

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:37.040
with these principles? Sure. Here's an example mission statement. Our mission is to continuously

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.880
improve our software development practices to better serve our customers and improve our business.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.560
We prioritize lean thinking and theory of constraints to identify and mitigate bottlenecks

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.160
in our systems. And we use data extensively to understand customer usage and close gaps

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.440
between product hypothesis and business impact. We foster a quality culture among our team,

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.960
nurturing each other towards greater maturity and coaching one another towards success. We

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.840
believe that the customer is the ultimate judge of our quality of our products. And we expand

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.840
abilities know how across the team to eliminate the need for dedicated specialists. My reply,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.840
that's a long fucking mission statement. Can you do it in 10 words or less? Sure.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.640
How about delivering quality software that drives business growth through continuous improvement?

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.280
Say that again.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.080
Delivering quality software that drives business growth through continuous improvement.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.060
I like that.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.740
But then I said, what do you think of accelerate the achievement of shippable quality?

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.780
Okay. I like that one too.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.140
It says it's a concise and effective mission statement that aligns well with the principles

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.740
you mentioned earlier. It conveys a sense of urgency and focus and quality while emphasizing

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.100
the importance of speed and efficiency in delivering software. Overall, it could serve

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.860
as a good rallying cry for a team that is focused on improving its software development practices.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.580
Hey, so we're almost out of time.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.660
We are. I'm going to give you the last question. I'm not going to read the answers because I'll

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.460
save these. I said the authors of the authors of the principles have a podcast called A B

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.780
Testing based on the principles, what are topics they should cover in their discussions.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.820
And it gave me a nice list of 10, 10 things to talk about.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.910
Which is pretty nice.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.910
We should start going through the list.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.070
We should. You're going to say.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:19.300
All right. I just now. So my iteration, I don't know what version of GPT you use,

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.460
but currently my favorite is the Bing bot.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.820
Which you told me to play with. I have not touched at all.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:32.000
Well, I could share screen, but I won't.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.920
That'll be a good podcast topic.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.240
Yes, I asked it.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:42.820
Read the book Accelerate and the following modern testing principles

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:49.380
and propose changes to the principles that are supported by Accelerate.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:57.310
And then I copy pasted the principles and it said, Hello, this is Bing.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.190
I'm happy to help you with the task. Smiley face.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:06.190
First thing you did the Bing actually search for the Accelerate book summary.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.910
Okay. So this is the one thing that's interesting around the Bing bot

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:16.030
because it can do with someone as info retrieval and incorporate that into the

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:22.980
into response. Whereas open AI is is is only trained up to 2021.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.220
Correct.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.740
And only knows what it knows. Okay.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.860
And I'll just go through. I'm not going to read.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.940
So what it did is it modified the principles.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.680
And the first one, our priority is improving the business and then it added

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.080
by delivering valuable software faster and more reliably.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:41.550
That's not horrible.

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:46.830
Principle number two, we use blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:54.030
mitigate bottlenecks from the system and optimize our software delivery process.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.440
Okay.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.400
Okay.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:04.110
Principle three, we are a force of continuous improvements, etc.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.710
Rather than using safety nets to catch your failures.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:13.630
And we measure our success using the four key metrics of software delivery performance.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.750
Oh, okay.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.870
It's actually not a not a bad mashup.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.560
Now for we care deeply about the quality culture

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.680
and nurture our team towards a more mature quality culture

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:34.030
that embraces continuous delivery, the management and DevOps practice.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.390
I kind of don't like that one feels redundant to principle two.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.790
I does.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:38.750
Yeah.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:43.630
Principle five, we believe that the customer is the only one capable

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.110
to judge and evaluate the quality of our products.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:51.790
And we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and feedback.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:58.480
And I'm like, okay, you just duplicated principle six, but what else?

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.590
Principle six, we use data too.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.470
But this is one thing interesting.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:09.550
We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and close the gaps

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.030
between product hypotheses and business impacts.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.060
And we deliver software in small batches and fast feedback loops.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.180
Those of us who don't go together.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.660
I mean, it's trying to shove the, that, that into all the principles.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:31.420
So the, well, it basically summarized, you can totally see how it's.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:31.980
Yeah.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.260
I see what it's doing and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:40.860
And it's just trying to find the, uh, the way to, it's doing exactly what I asked it to do

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.180
is they accelerate and approve it.

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:43.420
All right.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.820
You should share that in the Slack channel as well.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.940
And I'll try and do mine as well.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.380
Did a little formatting on it, but I am, I am late for my next meeting.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.060
So we're going to call that a day.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.460
Thank you.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.620
Chat GPT for being on the podcast today.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.980
You are a wonderful guest.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.300
Yes.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.260
All right.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.940
I am chat GPT.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:01.790
I am not.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:02.510
And I'm Alan.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.710
We'll see you next time.
