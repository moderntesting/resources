Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.820
Now, on with the show.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.780
Hey everybody, welcome to the AB Testing Podcast.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.660
I'm Alan.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.940
I'm Brent.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.380
And it is a beautiful sunny Friday afternoon here in the Pacific Northwest.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.660
Push an 80 today, I think, right?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.780
Oh, shit.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.780
That's Fahrenheit.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.810
Yeah, I know.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:44.010
It's, it's, uh, I've been having trouble sleeping lately because my, it's been too hot in the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.010
bedroom.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.580
Title of your sex tape.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.700
Uh, yeah, it's completely, uh, yeah.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.900
Dog and I took a hike to poo poo point yesterday.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.900
Um, what?

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.900
Poo poo point.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm not familiar with it.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.020
Is this some place in your neck of the woods?

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.020
It is.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.700
Uh, if you ever driven by Issaquah or the Kwa, as the kids call it, you ever see the, uh,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.860
the parachuters floating around?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.990
No.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.990
South of I-90.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.710
There's a hill they just, they just run and jump off of.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.710
Oh, really?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.810
Yeah.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.810
So it's pretty cool.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.810
Good little hike.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.650
That's, that's why it's called poo poo point.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.650
No, I know.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.050
And then I don't know if you saw, there was someone during the pandemic, someone bicycle

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.250
for the fun of it.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.690
They decided they were going to bicycle from poo poo point in Issaquah to PP Creek in like

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.010
Iowa.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.850
Just cause they thought it was funny.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.970
I I, I, uh, I appreciate that humor.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.290
Yeah, but it was good.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.050
So on one side is they take off and you can see the lake and all the way toward it.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.770
And then just, you kind of cut down.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.130
There's another clearing on the other side where you can see all the way to Mount Rainier.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.130
So that's pretty cool.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.930
But anyway, we did that.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.930
Yeah.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.850
Anything else big and cool going on in your world?

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:12.520
I, uh, as of last week, I am a proud dad of a graduated, um, student.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.400
My eldest is, is done with his bachelor's.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:26.240
He, he double majored in psychology as well as creative writing, uh, forced him to take

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.440
the bachelor of science version of psychology.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.680
So it was heavily math driven by the way.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
Yeah.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.200
Have your kids, your kids gone up to college yet?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800
Uh, my oldest is in running start.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.280
So he's, he's basically college.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.280
Yeah.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.720
So one of the deals I made with, with, uh, my kids.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.240
So we have, what's the Washington get?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240
What's this?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.680
That the wacky number, that's like a five oh two eight seven program.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.480
I don't, I don't remember where you can pre sort of buy credits for college.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
Yeah.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.080
The Washington one is kind of weird and sucky.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.600
We actually invest ours in New York's program, but you can use the money anywhere.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.510
Oh, I I'm, I've been very happy with the Washington one, but I honestly didn't, I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.270
haven't done much of a cross compare to determine if my decision was something I should regret.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.470
Anyway, one of the things I've told, told both of my boys that are in college is essentially

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.870
I have the money put away to pay for your degree, but there's a condition.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.710
You can pick any major you want, any major you want, but it has to be a bachelor of science.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.710
Okay.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.710
I'm out of your family.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.870
I have, I have bachelor of, I know my master's is, is masters in music, but as my bachelor,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.430
it's a bachelor of arts and music education.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.620
Yep.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.300
And a bachelor and a bachelor of music and music composition.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.860
I double majored as well.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.300
My son started off, he got applied, he got into the psych program.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.620
He's done exceptionally well there, but he has a real passion for, for, for creative writing.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.260
And one day he called me up.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.700
He's like, dad, I'm just telling you, transparently, I found a loophole in your strategy and I've

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.980
already executed on it.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.700
And I said, okay, what's this loophole?

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.220
He's like, you said, you said I have to graduate with a BS.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.300
And I'm like, yeah, that's right.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.540
He's like, okay, well I'm double majoring in my creative writing degree is going to be

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.540
a BA.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.580
And I said, son, good for you.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.100
Like, like,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.100
Very cool.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.620
I am always big fan of people getting a degree in the humanities.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.690
Good for him.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.690
Well, he's winning.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.290
He got, he got two degrees in the humanities.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.530
I do think psychology counts, even though it is a BS.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.970
The thing I, I was trying to balance him out with and he's, he generally tends towards

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.690
the humanities, but I wanted to balance them out with because there's a large degree of

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.890
humanity majors.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.010
In my view, you can't really make a living with.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.890
Well, and again, if you want me on that soapbox, you don't go to a university as a vocational

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.890
school.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.250
If you want to go to school to get a job, go to a vocational school, go to a university

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.570
to learn critical thinking and how to learn.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.530
Of course, there are going to be some skills that are going to help you land a job, but

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.370
I think you are better suited and more adaptable to different kinds of work with a humanities

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.370
degree.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.170
As long as you have the supporting other education to get, it's so hard to get a job out of

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:40.230
college, but I, I do not believe that a university is a vocational school.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:48.290
So I do not buy this argument of what are you going to do with a creative writing degree?

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.690
And maybe, maybe he writes 75 novels.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.850
Who knows?

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.850
Uh, who knows?

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.850
Who knows?

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.810
Um, and I don't want to waste the whole podcast because many things have stuff to talk about.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:06.200
What are we, I'm going to edit all the things, many of the things you just said, I, I, unlike

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.240
the other topics we're going to get to many of the things you just said, I disagree with,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
but okay.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.360
Well, yeah, it just means that you're wrong.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.880
So let's get on with the podcast and cause I'm very passionate about this and it's because

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.880
I'm right.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.520
So anyway, uh, are you ready?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520
Can we go on?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.880
Can we, can we hit topic numero uno?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.880
Yes.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.960
Topic numero uno.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.640
This week I spoke at testing festival, a large online test conference and I didn't really

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640
speak.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.120
I spoke at it, but what I did is a couple things I want to talk to you about and share

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.120
with our listeners.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.160
Cause it's all about modern testing.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
I did two things back to back.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.680
First thing was I gave a talk, but I gave the talk last week.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.200
No, I gave it to my dog last week.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.720
I recorded it.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.120
I was going to put the link in my, the it's on YouTube and I was going to put the link

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.220
in my five for Friday, but it's still unlisted and I didn't want to undermine any plans.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.900
The testing festival folks had for a larger unveiling of the talks.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.940
My talk is on YouTube and I'll share it at some point, but the talk was all about principle

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.180
number, which way, uh, shoot, which one's about a quality culture?

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.180
I almost said five, but five is about customer data.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.940
It's like four, right?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.220
Remember when we used to have memorized?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.220
So bad.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.220
So bad.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.220
I shouldn't look that up.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380
Yeah.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.460
I'm pretty certain that we have all of the controversial ones memorized.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.460
We do.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.260
We know the ones people complain about, but here's the thing, Alan, and I'll do it for

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.500
you right now.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.060
The way you can answer this question is simply by going to modern testing.org.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.760
Yes.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.880
And at modern testing.org, which is the one that talks about a quality culture?

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.640
Oh, you did it.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640
Nice job.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640
Number four.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.640
Yeah.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.280
That's because I'm right yet again.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:15.320
Uh, I gave a talk on leading a quality culture and introducing the quality culture guide.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.120
And it's just a, just a 25 minute talk.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.840
I gave a little bit of an intro on how it came about.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.000
I didn't go through the whole thing.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.120
I talked about the low level and the high level of the transition guide talked about

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.280
why I don't like maturity models.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.480
I think it's a pretty good talk primarily because I was able to edit it a little bit

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.680
before I submitted it to take out the crummy parts.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.680
And that worked out very well.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.160
So that was the talk I gave.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:48.000
And we had someone join our slack after that talk and say, Oh yeah, I've been, I've been

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.640
looking for a, what we always hear.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.120
I've been looking for a name for what we've been doing and it was cool.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.720
Uh, welcome.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720
Welcome to our community.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.360
So anyway, that talk, uh, nothing new here.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.720
It's really me going over the quality culture transition guide and with some intro to prep,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.160
like how it came about and why I think it's important for the audience there in hindsight,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.520
as I got to know them during the panel discussion, maybe just reminding them that quality is a

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.740
lot more than testing, which you and I get, and I think our regular listeners get, but

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:33.220
man, I'm never, I don't have a lack of surprise on how others forget or live in a different

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.220
world than we do.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.620
I always wonder about the size of the bubble we live in.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.620
Yeah.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:44.620
It's interesting to do sort of checks like, so one question, I think you began the answer

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.580
to it is so they obviously you recorded it.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.980
They obviously had some sort of, I'm guessing a scheduled time where, or somebody clicked

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.610
the button and played it back.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.010
How was sort of feedback or interaction?

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.010
Did that happen?

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:06.930
So it, so good segue and you didn't plan it to be, but so the way it worked out was

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:12.930
I did a panel discussion with, uh, Alan Richardson, Alan number one, or Scottish Alan, depending

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:18.730
how you want to refer to him and, uh, dot Graham, Dorothy Graham and Paul Gerard both

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.890
facilitated and took part in the panel afterwards.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:29.680
And we took some questions there and somewhere about the quality culture, but a lot were fun

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:37.720
because I got to disagree with the other panelists and that's always a good time for me.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.640
Uh, well, it was fun.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640
Go ahead, go ahead.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.640
Ask questions.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640
I'm gonna tell you all the fun I had.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.240
Did you have, cause here's what I'm imagining.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:55.400
I'm imagining you got to do an encore to the modern test manager versus traditional test

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400
manager.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400
Wasn't that bad?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.920
Like you were over the top well-rehearsed excellent.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.440
So there was no encore.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.800
So it wasn't like that.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800
Okay.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.040
They pushed my, some of the questions just teed up things we've been talking about.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.040
For example, there was a question around will ML replace testing?

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.960
And I got to roll my eyes, but also get on my little soapbox about how the, the new

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:27.560
record and playback automated testing tools have changed my mind about the value of recording

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.560
playback.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.240
And I actually think that it's a better way to do your UI automation than actually writing

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.400
crap.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.000
And so I got to, I got to go on that whole set.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Wait, wait, wait.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.680
So that one, that one based off of how you said it last time, it's because of the

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.680
ML.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.840
Absolutely.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.160
It's not, it's not, it's yeah.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:57.240
Every, every single year, some every day, someone's worried about the robots taking away their jobs.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.360
I remember listening to the radio 10 years ago and Amazon's warehouse is going to have

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:08.900
some robots, which they do that automate some of their picking for shipping and people were

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.900
freaking out.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.060
Oh, people are going to lose their jobs.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.620
Now there's always more stuff to do.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.020
So let's automate the boring stuff.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.860
So that was one, but another one was, but someone brought up the whole testing as information

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:26.330
providers.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:32.310
And I marched right up to the top of my soapbox and went off for a little bit on exactly

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.650
what you think I would go off on.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.410
And then there was a reply and the best part was on the reply, Alan Richardson said, I

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.890
think you're digging yourself deeper into your hole, not me to them.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.130
It was good.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.890
Was with that group, it was a very respectful debate because those are all those people

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.890
get it.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.250
They, they see different points of view.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:13:00.050
They don't dig in their heels and talk about epistemology or social sciences and how I'm

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.490
wrong because I haven't studied the right books.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:08.770
It was actually a respectful debate around what we see and people bending in the right

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.650
places to understand different contexts.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:18.890
So it was actually really cool, but I got to dissent and bring in my new view or my our

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:23.610
view of modern testing within that panel discussion, which was a ton of fun.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.690
I am looking forward to that.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.210
Yeah, I don't know if they, if they, hopefully they recorded that and they're going to

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.250
share that part too.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.130
Well, you said it was up on YouTube.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.410
No, my, my 25 minute talk is on YouTube.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.890
I do not know if they recorded the panel discussion.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.050
Hopefully they did.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.400
That's where all the, that's the money.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.400
I know.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.240
I know one wants to hear you babble on again about the same recorded it from my end.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.040
Like I'm just going to press record on what I could have done.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.720
Yeah, there were, it was fun.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.760
It was your typical questions.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.120
And I wish I still had them in front of me, but maybe I should dig out a copy.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.640
They're on some site somewhere and you and I can do another round of traditional

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.600
test manager versus modern test manager answering the questions.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.960
And this time I get to play the traditional.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:15.410
All right.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.610
But I did a pretty good job being traditional.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.890
And I can't remember who brought this up or where it came up, but I'm still

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:31.490
surprised how many people really, really, really hate the test automation

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.410
pyramid because it's upside down and backwards.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.010
No.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.890
And, and again, I brought up my point and actually, and if people don't like it,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.770
cause I get why they don't like it.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.980
And mostly it's because you can't always make your tests fit that model.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.260
But again, my insight that I came up with, I'm not sure, I'm sure I'm not the

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.060
first one, but it really made sense to me when I realized the testing pyramid

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:02.300
reflects the number of tests you have when your application is well-designed.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.620
Often you're writing more and more UI automation tests when your application

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.060
is designed because you have to test the logic in the UI.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.100
Right.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.540
Right.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:20.880
It's essentially they're designing the tests for the world where you don't

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.600
need the tests in some regards.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.920
I talked about also, I can't remember in which context, but I just brought up

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.950
monitoring a lot and customer data, which nobody looks at.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.750
Well, I shouldn't say nobody.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.510
There's a whole, it was just people on the other side of the bubble.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.150
So that leads, and that'll be fun.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.510
If there is a, like, if there is a recording of that.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.140
Panel, I will, I will definitely share it.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:58.390
You said who was on the panel, you, Dorothy Graham and Alan Richardson and Paul.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.470
Dorothy Graham.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.430
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.510
You should have brought up the ISTQB.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.150
ISTQB came up.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.790
There was a question, are certifications important?

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.590
And of course she was involved very early on in that.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:20.230
And I, so I was wanting to be respectful, but everyone had their say and they, and I

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.910
wasn't going to say anything, but then Paul called on me and said, what do you

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.430
think about this?

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.870
I said, look, I have no certifications.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.670
I think the courses behind the certifications, this is my, actually my

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.960
true feeling, but I was able to phrase it in a way that I think went over well.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.320
I said, but the courses are not about teaching testing.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.320
They've become a way to teach people to pass a test and get, and get people a

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.720
certification that may or not be worth anything.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.960
And it feels like the primary outcome of the certification is not better testers.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.280
It's about making money for ISTQB.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.320
The value to me is not worth, not worth what you get out of it.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:06.360
And Dorothy acknowledged that they turned into a moneymaking, I'll say scam here.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.560
I wouldn't say it for out of respect.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.480
I wouldn't say that there, but it turned, it's turned into a moneymaking scam.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.840
Like you were, I mean, you remember when I asked you ISTQB questions on the,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.560
yes, they're ridiculous and they're dumb and they don't, they're just stupid.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.640
And I'm all for testing.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.360
And if, and if you're trying to hire some junior tester and, and you think if you

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.080
get a certification, you'll think they'll be better, that's all great.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.320
But to charge you what they do for that is it's just ridiculous.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.560
It's just ridiculous.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.800
It's a total industry scam.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.260
And

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:45.820
Alan.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.620
Well, now what happened?

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:47.300
Yeah.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.060
No, I was just thinking through.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.060
Oh my God.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.820
Uh, how do, how do I say this?

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.220
We're on air cogently.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:03.010
You know, you know why we are seeing basically modern testing ghosts.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.010
We see it growing, but we see it grow so slowly.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.010
It's because of big test.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:14.250
Big test is actually suppressing the new ideas.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.960
I'm trying to construct a new, I hear you're looking at me like, I know, I know.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.920
This is the dumbest thing.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.990
People can, there's the thing we will never do a modern testing certification.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:34.590
There's a great course you can take if you are a ministry of testing pro member.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.980
So do that, but I'm never going to never going to be a certification.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.220
It's all about just helping people navigate as their world is changing.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.990
And more and more, when I give these talks, even if people in that other

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.710
world, their world is changing and more and more, we're finding people who have

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:57.430
our, their world's already changed and we'll help navigate the downside too.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:04.920
The, the more we can help people be informed or prepared when the world

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.750
does, when their world does change, uh, the better I that's what I forgot

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.830
to say something.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.280
Yeah.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.040
We're old.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.400
That happens all the time.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.720
It's even better.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.800
The next test bash home, 24 hours of test talks is coming up in June and I'm

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.600
doing an ask me anything on the future of automation.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.640
I'm going to fuck that shit up.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.240
I can show you the future of automation.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.240
I am going to shake the world.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.520
So you want to get into test automation.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.400
Do you now?

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.400
Do you?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.480
No, look, I look, all right.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.480
Here's how we get.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:55.880
All right.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.720
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm now thinking through.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.880
Brett is now the wheels.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.680
I can, I can smell coming through zoom.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.480
We need, we need a test automation certification.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.200
No, there are, we need a test automation certification.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.560
We like a modern testing test automation certification because test

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.840
automation certifications exist and they suck.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.920
No, no, we're going to provide one.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:22.560
Okay.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:29.000
And all you need to do to do this, number one, we'll create, I don't know,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.840
create a video.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.100
Okay.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:36.780
It's like a five minute video show, showing how to download the dominant tools

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.580
and how to set it up to do click and record.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:48.730
And then, then at the end of it, it's a test to, can you accurately

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.690
repeat back to, to our certification program, the, the URL where you

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:59.050
download the tool and if you can, you've passed the modern testing

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.370
automation certification.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:01.050
All right.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.560
No, no.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.500
Hey, uh, I don't know.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.820
Yeah.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.420
I love that.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:08.940
That's happening.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.220
Let's do a quick hold the cow twice in a row.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.060
Last time.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.260
I don't know if you've heard, I couldn't find my original mail bag sound.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.620
I didn't make a brand new one.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.300
And so I had a little fun with that and I don't know if it's on my other computer.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.940
No, I got a new Mac long story.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.460
Anyway, got to find my mail bag sound.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.700
It is mail bag time mail bag.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:33.900
All right.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.340
And, uh, this is from, uh, our friend global warming, Andreas warm.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.380
Uh, he says, so BDD.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:42.940
Right.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:48.540
Is that anything you think about or are you more data driven needle moving?

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.300
And BDD might be something teams are using to get results, but that

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.460
doesn't really affect you.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.900
Question mark.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.760
So really he's saying, guys, what are your opinions on B D D?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.590
Which is of course Brent's.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.160
I can't think of anything clever on Brent driven development

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.600
or B a V your driven development.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.600
So have you done BDD Brent?

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.400
Uh, I have tried doing BDD.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.440
I, I, I find TDD easier.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:24.640
The, the problem with BDD is, is the construct, right?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:31.770
The given went then is, is very, it's a very clean thing, but it's not natural.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:33.190
There you go.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.150
Okay.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.710
Let me give you a different opinion.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.430
Okay.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:41.870
Cause I actually find it both valuable and dumb depending on how you use it.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.350
And here's the deal.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.600
BDD is excellent.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.840
And to me, 99% of the value comes from thinking about the

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.680
behavior of your software and the outcomes you want from it before you

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.440
begin to write it or your, or your feature or whatever you're creating.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.000
Yes.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.480
Given.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:00.640
Yeah.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.760
And so that part super valuable.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.320
The automation part just feeds into what I call the industry

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.560
fatuation with end to end testing.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.280
And there are tools, of course, all the gherkin tools that you

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.280
automate all this stuff.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.320
I don't care if you automate it.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.240
I got the most value at a BDD when we just defined the behaviors up front and

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.680
made sure we did that as part of our requirements gathering or planning.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.760
Planning that requirements gathering and skip the automated stuff.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.280
Didn't care.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.800
So we'd automate anyway, but I wouldn't worry about automating

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.640
those given to end then tests, but getting the team to agree and

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.080
elaborate on those behaviors ahead of time as part of planning.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.000
Massively valuable.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.560
It helped people focus on not over-developing or undeveloping.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.080
They focused on exactly what the thing had to do, help them figure out.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.480
It just so much alignment came from that.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.320
If you think of BDD as essentially a breakdown, this is how I view it.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.420
The BDD, the things that you're creating ultimately are, they're very aligned

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:18.340
with user stories, but on a very focused behavioral basis.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:19.290
Yeah.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.210
I agree with you.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.330
Thinking through it is absolutely valuable.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.810
I don't know.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:29.290
To me, it, in terms of turning it into a unit test, it feels a

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.250
bit overhead ish.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.460
Yeah.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:32.820
Okay.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.700
I mean, you for different reasons, but it doesn't turn into a unit test, turns

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.420
into some, some flavor of end to end or integration acceptance test.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.780
And I'm all for automating acceptance tests.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:50.620
I think if the, if the focus of BDD is on the behavior, so I don't like

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.460
behavior driven development, I just like, I don't care about the, well, it

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.700
is behavior driven development, even if I only think about the behavior, I don't

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.220
automate it.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.340
It's someone decided, Oh, and we can automate this stuff too.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:07.690
And people get focused on the automation and that's not where the value is.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.370
It could help, but it's not where the value is for me.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:11.250
Yeah.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:17.050
In terms of both BDD or TDD, like the biggest value of that is to drive

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:24.490
a thoughtful process that, that forces you to number one, get, get your

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.090
tests done upfront.

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:34.010
Uh, number two, which is the biggest value, which is to design your classes.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.970
Better in some regards.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.930
I don't really care if people go with BDD or TDD.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.410
People, if you, whatever technique you want to make sure that you think about

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:48.570
what little bit of ready aim fire versus ready fire aim, think a little bit

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.690
about what you're trying to accomplish before you race off to the compiler.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:53.330
That's all.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.240
Yeah.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.760
Yeah.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.680
And then in part of global global vermin's, uh, question was, is that anything

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.320
you think about or are you more data-driven and needle moving and what, how

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:14.000
did you interpret the or cause to me it's both.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:14.760
Yeah.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.560
I, I, those aren't, those aren't, yeah.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.480
I, I kind of ignored that cause I didn't, I didn't think about it that much, but

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.680
we are more data-driven and I'm always moving that needle.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:31.590
What I do is I, I, my role, actually I'm managing so many damn people and I don't

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.350
even get to do much coaching anymore, but, uh, showing it as an option.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.860
If people do planning, because one of the things I do a lot and now I've

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.140
delegated most of that is helping teams understand how to do better planning.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.900
Because we believe our engineers should own their own project management.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.220
So part of helping them think about how to do their estimates and

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.060
planning is frequently I'll walk through what BDD is and I'll give them

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.620
my same speech, the values and the behavior, not in the automation, and

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.740
they can use it if they want.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:01.740
Right.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.180
It's, um, completely agree.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:10.580
I do think, again, the value proposition in my mind is, is you think through it.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.180
I, I'm still connecting the dots to the data-driven and needle move.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:21.380
To me, having a good design of your architecture is needle moving.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:26.210
It, it, it, because I've experienced it over and over again.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:31.570
It's, it's, um, replating architecture because you did something screwed

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.290
up in the first place is hard.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:38.610
So any, anything that gives you a tool that helps you to go, like

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.650
you've said it before, devs are lazy, right?

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.930
Anything that says, okay, how can I design this way?

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.090
So I don't have, I have to do less work later.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.050
Hey, Brett, you know what the sound is?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.400
No.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.560
That's us beating the dead horse.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.400
So I have one other topic, which is open ended and maybe fun.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.480
Okay.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.080
Let's talk about DevOps.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.320
Okay.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.660
What the hell is DevOps?

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.540
So first of all, uh, let me get into the three ways that DevOps first,

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.780
which we've talked about before on here.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.700
So there's the three ways that DevOps, a gene came up with.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:27.380
The first way is all about flow and systems thinking that's modern testing.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.710
The second way is to amplify the feedback loops, a little bit of modern testing.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:38.910
And the third way is build a culture of continual experimentation and learning.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.430
Also modern testing.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:47.200
So on one hand, lots of parallels between the, what we think about

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.880
modern testing and three ways of DevOps.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:55.350
But I noticed some interesting parallels this week in, I saw an article come out

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.870
and, and I can't even remember what it was, but I realized something and I tweeted

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:04.230
it and it was one of those things where I tweeted, people said, uh, yeah, Alan,

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:10.890
you just noticed some things now, which is that, well, Brett, what is DevOps?

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:17.810
Well, the way you described it DevOps honestly is nothing more than CICD.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.410
And then I'm thinking through that.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:24.810
You were around in the old days of, and we had this definitely in the early

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:30.610
2000s at Microsoft where we built some services and we chucked them over the

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.530
wall for operations to deploy and maintain.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.250
So, so where did DevOps come from?

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:41.450
And that's essentially this brand new concept where Dev owns the

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.970
operation of the crap that they built.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:44.330
Yeah.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.770
Right.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.410
So DevOps was originally introduced.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:53.050
Well, it's introduced as a culture where the wall between developer

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.250
and operations is non-existent.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.810
Right.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:00.930
In many ways, like my view is it enables a, you build it, you run it culture.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:02.510
All good.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:10.570
But what I've seen more and more, which scares me is people will have a team

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.130
will have a DevOps person or a DevOps team.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:19.250
And what that DevOps team does is the operational stuff we saw people do 20

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.690
years ago at Microsoft, they're an operations team, they're calling them

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:27.010
DevOps and it scares me because it it's backward.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:32.130
And if we look at what DevOps does, you know what it does?

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.210
It accelerates the achievement of shippable quality, accelerate, we're

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.050
talking about feedback loops and amplifying feedback loops and

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.450
cultural experimentation as DevOps.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:42.690
That's also modern testing.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.450
Uh, it, I don't know.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:52.930
I mean, accelerating the achievement of shippable quality, that's a big umbrella.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:53.210
Right.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.570
It's it's, there's a lot of things, right?

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.690
But what I'm saying is two things.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:03.450
One is your DevOps team does not exist to do your operations for

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.610
you or to do your DevOps for you.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:06.570
Well, no.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.130
So the problem is, is that they probably do.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:09.930
The bullet prop.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.370
Well, I know the problem is you have a DevOps team, but I think DevOps has,

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.050
it's become the fancy name for an infrastructure team.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:23.370
You often, especially like the scale of unity, we need a team that can do

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:28.650
the high level management of our cloud platform, our CI CD systems, uh, to

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.410
make sure everyone, make sure we have some consistency available in what

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.290
CI pipelines you use, how you get your code deployed.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.530
We don't want everyone to have to invent their own stuff, but

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.890
definitely it's the you build it, you run it culture.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:54.100
I think like a team, a team called the DevOps team, in my view, their job should

00:31:54.100 --> 00:32:02.930
be not to operate the, the code, the devs servicing, but their job, but much

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:07.210
like what we talked about with modern testing, their job is to construct,

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.650
maintain and encourage the DevOps culture.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:12.290
Right.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:16.850
Well, what I'm seeing, not just in the three ways being similar to the

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.730
principles or the intent we have with the principles, I'm seeing a lot more

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:26.170
parallels between, and again, I think having a DevOps team can be a little

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.850
bit of a, little bit of a smell, depending on what they actually do.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:37.170
But we talk about teams not needing a dedicated QA person in modern testing.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:46.370
I think like the way my team's function is we have high functioning teams with

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:53.130
deploying dozens of times a day and with very, very little interaction or even

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.890
questions from my team, they're basically function there.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:57.090
They don't need our help.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:58.970
They're, they're running everything on their own.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:03.330
Some teams need a little bit more handholding and they'll all get there, but

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.280
they don't need a dedicated, and again, we wouldn't embed someone

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.280
on their team, like with a tester, but they don't need dedicated DevOps help.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.840
They haven't figured out they actually have adopted the culture completely.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:21.560
So my team exists to help people get to that culture of DevOps and

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.200
get to that culture of quality.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:23.840
Okay.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.720
Lots of paral, I've been thinking about this, lots of parallels.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:33.600
So I don't think AB DevOps has the right sound.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.120
So we'll stick with AB testing.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.240
Yeah.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.960
C like we go ABC DevOps.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.240
We, Oh, what if we brought someone with a letter C onto the podcast?

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:49.080
Uh, I, I've told you before, we should just rename to AB checking.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.600
Yes.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.680
Cause that's important.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.280
Then, then you have your ABCD.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.720
I took a little dig in my testing festival talk.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.840
Once it's out, you'll see it.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.080
I talk about loud voices and stuff.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.640
You talk about loud voices in testing, throwing out models because

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.440
well, yeah, actually, uh, Steve Rowe.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.910
And I think he talked, I think one of the times it's been a long time.

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:20.230
We should bring him back.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:21.750
What's he doing now?

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:25.310
We should have him back on and find out checking in with Steve.

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:33.150
But he, he talked about how, uh, one of those loud voices was just

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:36.390
riddled with lot logical fallacies.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.270
Oh, yeah.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.310
I know, I know exactly.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.790
Yes.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.040
I just ignore, I mean, I try to ignore it, but it's fun to pick at it too.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.280
The nice thing, the nice thing about the three, right?

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.760
Uh, I don't know if you paid attention to the thread on the Slack channel, but

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.440
I was getting, I was getting geared up.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:01.920
Um, uh, to, to like this, this whole language debate on testing versus checking.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.080
It's dumb and it just needs to go away.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.360
And I was getting all riled up and go, okay, how do I help make this go away?

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.320
But the three men, this is one of the things I really love about our community.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.200
The three was just like, look, Brent, you're not seeing all the data.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.680
We see it better than you in some regards.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.400
And I agree.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:33.760
And they are actually living in a increasingly shrinking bottle bubble from 1998.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.680
Yeah.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.960
They basic, basically they didn't say this explicitly, but they said, look,

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.200
our time is not as better spent helping people move to the future.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.720
Not like the past is killing themselves all by themselves.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.190
They don't need our help agreed.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:53.110
That's it.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:54.620
All right.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.820
Now a real important thing.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.060
So you went to the testing testing festival.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.220
I've been meaning to ask why is it not called the testable?

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.340
I was not involved in the creation of it.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.340
Oh, all right.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:08.940
Fair enough.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.940
It should be, I'm thinking it should be.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.300
So I wanted to, um, I wasn't quite done with DevOps.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:14.820
Yeah.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.820
Please go back to it.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.700
It'll get like the one thing too, that I'll also say it's interesting

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.740
that you're like, Hey, Brett, sudden insight.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.020
Hey, modern testing is very similar to DevOps.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.820
Yeah.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.420
Um, good.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.020
Alan.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:29.580
Good.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.420
Good boy.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.500
I'm so glad.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.230
Like I'm, I'm with them on Alan really.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:36.350
Okay.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.950
Sure.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:44.920
But do you realize, like, I don't, I don't know DevOps DevOps number

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.480
one, it's not deployed very well.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.800
It's also number two.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.320
It's also another thing on its way to, to die.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.160
Right.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:58.780
As I mentioned, uh, when trying to find on the web, like there was, there

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.060
were all sorts of star ops things.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:09.260
And right now one of them is AI ops and even AI ops is, is on its way out.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:09.980
Yeah.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:14.540
I think all of these things ops are, I mean, DevOps to me, there's also

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.140
fun test ops or DevSecOps or DevTestOps.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.780
Uh, to me, they're all DevOps because DevOps is all about getting rid of the

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.820
walls because they are bottlenecks.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.180
And in modern testing, we don't like bottlenecks.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.660
And one thing I like to point out, Brent, is I know you're nodding your head on.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.660
Yeah, these are the same, but remember the podcast is not for you.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.140
It's for the three people that listen to it.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.890
And they may, and they may nod their heads too, but I want to go

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.850
ahead and plant the seed anyway.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.450
Is, is that the rationalization you're going to use?

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:47.170
All right.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.490
Yeah.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:49.650
Here's my question.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:50.170
All right.

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:57.200
Can you automate DevOps or is it, or is it, or do you do manual DevOps or automated DevOps?

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:04.350
Um, there's obviously a trap there somewhere.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.070
Because real DevOps can't be done.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.150
Can't be automated.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.860
I'm just making up stuff.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.600
You're not doing DevOps.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.960
Oh, you're doing, I don't know.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.560
Oh yeah.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.460
I'm trying to make up something Dev dumbass.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.180
I don't, I don't know.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.140
I get what you're going.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:28.540
Yeah.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:33.060
Let's have a, no, that's that it's not DevOps.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.090
That's that is modern testing, right?

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.570
I'm actually looking through, I just happened to come into a page and says,

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.610
what's the difference between DevOps and Agile?

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:53.640
And unfortunately the webpage I'm on, uh, is not saying frigging nothing.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:59.500
So, uh, this came up once I was in a conversation, I can't remember what

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.380
form it was on, it may have been Reddit.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.740
Uh, I can't, it must've been about one of my articles or something, but

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.820
someone was saying that, well, we're moving on from Agile.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.700
I said, what we're moving on from Agile.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:11.940
Yeah.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:12.980
Agile is old news.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.340
Now we're doing DevOps.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:21.520
I thought, what the, it's the same thing.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:27.270
Um, it's not, it's not.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.870
And I just glanced through it and I understand what they're saying.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:39.190
Agile is a set of, um, practices geared around the process.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:40.620
Okay.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:44.860
DevOps is, is actually much more of a technical practice.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.740
No, it's, it's, it's on, is there is principles around delivering

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:54.620
frequent customer value and DevOps with that one in mind, DevOps is

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.940
an implementation strategy.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.420
DevOps enables.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:58.260
Yeah.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.220
It's, but they're, you don't move from one to the other is my point.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.540
But you, you also like the thing I'm reading right now,

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.460
so let me ask you this.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.620
Can you be agile with a separate ops team?

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.340
Uh, not in my definition, but mine neither.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.260
Uh, but a lot of the agile, if you have, wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.620
checking stuff over the wall at any, a lot of people, a lot of people still today

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.140
view scrum as agile, well, they're stupid.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:27.980
Right.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.180
And, and in a scrum model, absolutely.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.300
You can chuck things over.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:32.540
Yeah.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.340
That, that just angers me and, and the, there's too much ritual around scrum.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.900
I let teams do it if they want, because I don't, yeah, whatever.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:45.760
But, and again, actually scrum can be very good, but too many teams turn it

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.000
into mini waterfall and it drives me freaking crazy.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.720
So anyway, go on.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:59.910
Now, I was just saying, like agile, uh, I was actually writing up a, I've been

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:04.910
asked to do this and I've been revisiting the Galazzo deck.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.670
Right.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:06.390
Oh yeah.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.870
That yeah.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:12.190
The, the famous Galazzo deck, the famous Brent's too lazy to actually get

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.550
off his butt and publish it.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:18.870
Like he keeps promising year over year over year over year.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:23.110
Well, maybe after the pandemic's over, it can be presented at modern testing

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:27.870
conference, maybe, maybe the app would happy to do that by that time.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.710
And that certainly would be enough motivation.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.350
Why hasn't there been an online modern testing conference yet?

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:37.980
Uh, same reason, same reason as usual.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.500
Sounds like work.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.420
Oh yeah.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:41.620
Yeah.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:51.640
Like to me, uh, an agile practice is, is one that achieves three goals simultaneously.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:58.910
It adds confirmed value, reduces calendar time and reduces engineering time.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:04.000
That that's sort of anything that does that in my mind.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.080
Uh, does it reduce calendar time calendar time is a constant.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.070
Calendar time to delivery.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.350
This is cycle time.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:13.860
Okay.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:20.080
Let's say you and I are working on the same thing and we can continuously, the

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.400
two of us working together, we can continuously put it up, push out this

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:29.790
widget in a day, can we bring that down sooner to a half a day or, and, or can

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:35.300
we figure out a way to say that we don't need both of us on it calendar time?

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.620
How is I get the, how's that different from the third thing you said though?

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:40.570
Oh, engineering time.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.850
The biggest difference between engineering time and calendar time.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.050
That one's easy and you should know this.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.530
That's, that's the delay time.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:55.090
That's the time where the, where the work is sitting and doing nothing.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:56.370
It's not moving forward.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:57.330
It's sit idle.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:58.450
It's the equivalent.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.490
Two part of the same thing.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.830
No, no.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.870
Like you and I may have delay in our widget delivery.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.230
I'm I'm all I, and I get what you're talking about, but can't it

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.790
all be about just tightening feedback loops?

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.230
Uh, I don't know how you brought feedback loops in here, but calendar

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.310
time, think of it this way.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.550
Let's say you are working on two projects.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:19.610
Yeah.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.330
Okay.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.590
You can't, uh, you are working on two coding projects.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.830
Right.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.190
It is fizz.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:31.150
You are physically enabled to work, but both of us at the same time.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.950
Okay.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:39.290
So when you stop working on one, that is adding a delay in the calendar

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.890
time for that one, because it's going to go out later.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:44.750
All right.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.470
Okay.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:52.270
So, so, uh, if you think about it in terms theory of constraints, one of the, uh, one

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:57.630
of the key things in addition to bottlenecks, they, they advertise is you, you

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:59.950
analyze in your root cause.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:01.550
Uh, this is actually right.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:03.670
Here's his book is the best way of thinking of this.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:04.830
That's what I've been visualized.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:05.750
No time you've been talking.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.950
You, you go when you look at his discussion around whip.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.910
Yep.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:19.190
Discovering transparency and rooting out the sources of delay in your system

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:24.950
speeds up your ability to produce widgets in a faster calendar time

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:26.990
without impacting engineering time.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.380
Okay.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:28.900
I get it.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.700
One's about optimizing the optimizing two different parts of the system.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:34.860
Yes.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.160
Okay.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.520
And I just look at them all collectively as optimize the whole damn system.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.660
Well, that's important.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.540
That's important.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:42.900
All right.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:43.620
Okay.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.060
I get it.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:44.580
I get it.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:44.980
I get it.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:49.100
And I think, uh, again, uh, ran it some plug is always good here.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.400
So yeah.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:51.860
All right.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:56.180
DevOps, agile, parallels, whatever, and a mailbag.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.700
I think we did well this time.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:44:59.540
Yeah.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.660
So next, next Friday you're getting shot number two, right?

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.940
I am.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:03.900
Yeah.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:04.940
Yeah.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:12.660
This potentially this time in one week, I will be in the fetal position

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.980
someplace in the Pacific Northwest.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:16.820
Savi.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.660
So my timing on mine is really bad.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.060
I talked, I was laughing with my team about this.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.140
So my second, so we have the, we have a four day weekend, eight at unity.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.340
Uh, anytime there's a three day weekend, like from Memorial day, they go ahead

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.940
and give us the previous Friday off and make it a four day weekend.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.940
So they actually just gave us some more Fridays off this summer, which is great.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:42.060
We're taking, getting some extra time off, but this four day weekend at the end of

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.380
it on the Tuesday afterwards, I get my second shot, have the four day weekend

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:52.140
and then miss a day probably after that almost as you know, almost everybody

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.820
feels like crap after the second shot.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.540
But the good news is it's like a flu without the congestion and mo for

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.140
most people, most people get that and most people, it goes away within a day,

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.340
but we'll see what happens.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.820
And yours is when Memorial, June 1st.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:09.620
Okay.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.360
So I should be good to go by Friday.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.600
We'll learn about my, uh, two weeks.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:15.840
Yeah.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.080
Yeah.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.080
We'll learn about mine and recovered.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:18.680
Yep.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.240
All right.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.600
We should call it a day, man.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.520
All righty.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.360
All right.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.080
Thanks everyone.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.720
We'll see you next time on AB DevOps.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:28.840
Checking.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.560
Yeah, that one.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.040
See ya.
