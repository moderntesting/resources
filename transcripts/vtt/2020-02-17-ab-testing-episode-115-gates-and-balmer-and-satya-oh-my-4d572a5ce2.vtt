00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.820
Welcome to A.B. testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.540
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.820
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.980
Now on with the show.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.660
Good morning and welcome to the A.B. testing podcast.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.660
Hello.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.650
Hello.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.610
What I want to do today is take a deep breath and reflect on the last 114 episodes and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.160
ask yourself why would you come back for more?

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.160
I'm Alan.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.160
I'm Brent.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.280
We're here for episode 115 of the A.B.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.960
testing podcast.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.080
And it's not like I plan it, but I just like to surprise Brent a little bit.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.080
It's good to see you, man.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.080
It's been a while.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.080
It has been a while.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.080
We have had...

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.520
I'm not even certain we have a good answer to why we need to come back for more.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.760
Because it's like watching a train wreck.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.360
People want to see what's going to happen.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.360
That's probably the best reason I could think of.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.390
Yeah.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.630
So travel, holidays, other stuff.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.750
We did do a show in 2020, right?

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.750
We did.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.190
So this is our second of 2020.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.190
It is.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.190
We're a little slow.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.470
We're going to get back on track.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.390
I don't have any extensive long traveling trips coming up.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.390
I am.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.210
Of course, no one wants to travel anymore today due to the coronavirus, the virus

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.010
you get from drinking Mexican beer.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.010
Right.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.010
Is that right?

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.010
That's what I have.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.770
I haven't been totally caught up on the details, but I know I didn't have any trips to China,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.210
so those aren't canceled.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.170
So anyway, we're back.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.450
We're going to do a podcast and we'll do another one in a couple of weeks as well

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.770
and try and get back on track.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.760
Is that true?

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760
Is that our...

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.280
Brent, Brent, rolling your eyes and shaking your head.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.000
The probability is greater than 50%.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.200
After 115 episodes, Brent doesn't quite realize that people who listen to this silly thing

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.720
can't see his face.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.240
Anyway, shall we just...

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.120
Anything particularly exciting or interesting to talk about before we get off onto our topics?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.920
I'm going to Scottsdale, Arizona this weekend.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
Going to retire?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
No.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
Play golf?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920
No.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
Watch the Mariners?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920
Go...

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.360
Did they train there?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.900
I don't know.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.000
Going to do exactly nothing.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.280
And you're going to go all the way to Scottsdale, Arizona to do that?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
Yes.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.360
Because you're going to do exactly nothing someplace that's warm.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.360
Yes.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.240
That's exactly what we're excited about.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.600
I'm going to go be colder next week.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.440
It's my yearly pilgrimage to Whistler to try and see if my aging body can still fly down

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.820
a mountain.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.460
Yeah, it should be fun.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.500
There's a lot of exciting things coming my way, coming up in the near future.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.630
I'm apparently doing a presentation to Satya next month.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.990
Share with you and the three.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.870
Oh my God, is my imposter syndrome just proactively triggering.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.870
Excellent.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.430
We're going to talk more about that later.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.950
That would have been a great segue.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.550
It would have.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.070
But that will get you...

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.950
That little teaser will get you to come back and listen to the whole podcast.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.150
But you also mentioned, obviously I can't talk about it, but yesterday I can talk about

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.150
some things.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:49.760
So Microsoft has a whole world crisis team that go through and run humanitarian missions.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.640
You may have heard that we're in the news.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:06.240
We have a plan where we're going to be completely carbon neutral, including retroactively sometime

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.040
in the next few years.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.960
So there's a humanitarian aspect of Microsoft that is on the rise and growing.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:33.810
But my team, which now has some renown for natural language processing, is within Microsoft,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.930
has been called in to assist on the coronavirus stuff.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.460
So I already know, for example, at least one thing the common populace doesn't know.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.000
Not sharing that here.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.600
Are we all going to die?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600
No.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.480
Is that thing you can't answer?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
Not all of us?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.480
Okay, great.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480
No.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.880
And if you haven't done research, so this is the thing that's very common with this

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.200
type of stuff.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:13.670
So coronavirus is, in essence, a worse flu virus.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.790
So flu virus you can die from.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.930
Coronavirus, there's a greater likelihood that you can die from, but not significantly

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.960
greater.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.510
So like Douglas Haddow would say, keep calm, don't panic.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.510
It's not...

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.110
You can actually do a lot of harm by panicking.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.110
People want to panic.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.680
They want this to be the one.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.920
The 20th century, the 21st century black plague.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.800
It's not going to be that.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.800
I think the worst thing that's going to happen is a lot of people are going to be inconvenienced

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800
greatly.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.850
All right.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:02.850
All right.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.850
Shall we start?

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.850
Yeah.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.850
Okay.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.210
I have to turn around and see what the topic on the board...

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.770
Oh, I should mention, we're in a whole new building.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.170
Brent has moved offices.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.170
Yes.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.930
He's in a secret location.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.010
I can't announce it.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.370
I had to be blindfolded, had a hood over my head, a couple of people walked me out along

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.810
to the hallways, and I'm in the middle of a dark room, middle of a building inside of

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.890
somewhere at Microsoft.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.600
So that's exciting, but let's just hope I get out in time to edit this podcast.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
It actually...

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.200
So it's fairly new to me as well.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.640
It took us a good five minutes just to find the conference room because I haven't been

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.520
in the building long enough to know these things.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.680
And I was a little late and I thought Brent would be prepared, but I thought wrong because

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680
I didn't want to.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.680
I don't know why you would think that.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.680
There was no reason.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680
There was no reason.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.040
So let's go ahead and segue into the topic you alluded to earlier.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.600
You're presenting to Satya.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.600
Yep.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
And I have presented to Satya.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.400
Well, I've been part of a presentation to Satya, which is way different.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.240
I have also been part of a presentation to Bill Gates, and I have also was around

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.680
during the Steve Ballmer area.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.680
So area?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.840
Steve Ballmer era.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.320
In my time off, I forgot how to speak, but whatever.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.480
One of the three whom I've forgotten asked if we could talk about like what's different?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.380
What was Microsoft like in the Gates, Ballmer and Satya eras?

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.560
So that's, I think it's worthy of an opinion.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.320
I have opinions of all three.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.380
I don't know how you want to structure this or start because we started about the same

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.380
time at Microsoft.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.300
We both had a significant amount of oh, there has been a significant milestone.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.620
I saw I'm now on an age where significant milestones just make me feel old.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.260
You have no idea.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.940
But last week I hit my 25th year.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.940
Oh, wow.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.940
Yeah.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.940
I, where would I be?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.380
If I was still at Microsoft, I was slightly behind you, right?

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.380
So I would hit 25 in.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.900
Oh, June, this June.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.900
Yeah.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.690
I actually remember you being slightly ahead of me, but it would have been at Microsoft

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.450
since January, 95, but I wasn't full time until June.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.170
So June would have been my 25.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.170
All right.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.420
Then.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.420
Yeah.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.700
So we're very similar.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:40.160
You have less experience now on how the Satya era is progressing, but I don't know.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160
I guess I'll just start.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.000
Should we stop and go backward or how do you want to do this?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.260
So here's.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.360
You want to start and I'll jump in with commentary.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360
Yeah.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.760
So here's how I view and we will have different perspectives and I guess we can just talk

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.560
about what we see as a different perspective.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:06.240
The way I see the three CEOs and it was it was interesting that the bomber and the

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:15.190
Bill Gates, at least during my career here, was very cleanly separated by decades.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.190
Right.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:25.730
Microsoft, as you may or may not know, started in 1975 in actually Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.730
Right.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.050
All well-known facts.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.550
I did not join until 1994.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.990
So there was nearly two decades of Microsoft before I came here.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.030
Yeah.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.270
And for context, because we joined about the same time, Microsoft was about 15,000 people

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.270
back then.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.430
Probably 94 a little less.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.250
It was 15 when I joined.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.250
Yeah.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:54.940
My, if you use batch numbers, those aren't sequential.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.380
So I have a five digit batch number.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.380
Mine too.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.500
And I can tell you mine because it's not, it's not, it's invalid.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.580
I still remember my numbers, 39630.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.580
Yeah.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.060
So mine's 5,000 less than yours.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.700
But again, Alan believes they're not sequential.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.620
I think at that time they were, but I don't know.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.620
Don't care.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.140
Not relevant today.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.650
Here's how I see as the three different decades.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:30.220
And I don't know if Satya has already been here a decade, but it's coming up on it.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.060
Bill Gates, we were all about growth.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:45.260
And the way I would specify that that decade was sort of the competitive innovation decade.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Right.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.700
We were rapidly growing.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:58.760
The way Bill ran things, he highly encouraged cross team competition.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:09.000
In some regards, that cultural aspect is what led not only James, but I think also you to

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
leave the company.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yeah.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Right.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.600
Because it's competition over customers.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.020
Right.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.540
Competition is more important than the customer.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.540
Internal competition.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.540
Everything's about competition.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.860
Internal, but it was the way to build up the abilities to compete for external customers

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.860
was to compete internally.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.020
And that was still around.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:34.060
When I worked on teams to jump ahead, there were at least two or three other groups that

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.020
thought they were building a Slack competitor.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.700
Our team just built the one that Satya liked best.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.760
Right.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760
Right.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:49.840
And while I don't have a lot of visibility, I don't know too many teams that are doing

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.960
it today.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.280
I do believe that they are still likely teams in Microsoft, both believing that they are

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.420
going after the same mission.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.910
And that's that as a business strategy, I think that's fine.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.350
It's fine.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:14.110
It's not again, I got burned out on competition being part of the way we built software,

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:20.630
even internal within a team due to the way people were reviewed, the way the highly

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.110
competitive I must crush you to get up.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.470
It's like this isn't helping people.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:34.950
The incentive model in combination with these, these competitive, again, competitive innovation

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:43.030
strategies created a lot in my view, it created a long term cultural issue that actually

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.390
still exists today.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:52.130
Not nearly as bad as it did, but still exists and is detrimental today.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:13:03.440
New startups that are going into space similar to Microsoft, they have the ability to move

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.240
forward in a way because some of the teams within Microsoft are going to be busy stepping

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.440
on each other's toes, which will slow us down.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.760
I'm reminded of a Steven Sinek story.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.920
I believe was in leaders eat last, but I could be wrong.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.600
Ray talks about I'm sure I shared this on the podcast before where he was at a Microsoft

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600
exec offside.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:33.500
This is in the Balmer era and he saw presentations from execs and 90% of them were about competing

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.620
their competitors.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.840
Who are they competing with?

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.480
That team, that team, that team, and that company, that company.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.640
Then he went to an Apple and they've changed also.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640
They have new CEOs.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:53.360
Went to an Apple exec retreat within the same year and 100% of those customers were what

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.800
they were doing for the customer.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:01.200
I think there's something to be said about corporate culture there.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.450
Did you ever go to a, were you ever part of a Bill G review?

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.490
Not a Bill G review.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:13.250
I mean, I've been in meetings with Bill, but never one of the official Bill G reviews.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:19.090
So I had two, I had two unique experiences with Bill Gates.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.250
One was presenting in a group of test architects.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.870
The original six or seven of us gave a presentation to him on what was going on.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.190
It was state of the art and testing.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.910
And we just made, made stuff up.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.470
But I remember him walking in the room and saying something to the effect of I'm glad

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:39.790
you're here.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.910
I pay a ridiculous amount of money to hire testers for my company, but I don't know what

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.210
you do.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.530
But after that, he was really nice.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.410
He was actually interested in what we had to talk about.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.410
He liked the techniques.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:58.940
We showed him some model based testing stuff with some visualization and he loved the visual.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.260
He wanted to play with the visualization for a long time, but we didn't let him.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.260
We moved on.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.500
But anyway, very super mellow friendly.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.500
Yeah.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:16.140
He was in a Bill G business review years later and he got the result he wanted and it was

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.980
it was good to watch him work because he was so smart and so quick and he could pick apart

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:27.660
anything and he would spot better than anyone I've ever seen where you had, where you were

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.790
right and where you were hand waving.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:37.500
And to me, people knew this about him, yet they still fell back on.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:45.220
I mean, just the idea that I would, I was watching a PM on our team get torn apart because he

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:54.000
went off script, started talking a little bit hyperbolic and, and he got ripped apart.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.700
So it was about facts and data and not feelings and about knowing exactly what you're doing

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.660
and why you were doing it and backing it up and anything else was just shredded off

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.400
like meat on a bone.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:20.830
There is a bit of advice that I give people and it's very relevant here.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:30.130
I don't know if it prevails multiple different companies here.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.200
A path of success is visibility.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:40.640
And it's well known, hey, like for example, I'm doing a presentation to Satya.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.960
I should be super excited.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.880
I'm going to be visible to Satya.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:52.200
That's going to grease the wheels for my triple skip promotion next month.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:58.960
That's I think, I mean, that's hyperbole, but that's kind of how the old school guard

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960
would view these things.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.760
And I'd say very much the way it's viewed now.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:10.120
I mean, I've been gone three years, but that was, that was still 100% the case three years

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.240
ago.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240
Go on.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.880
It is not 100% today, but yes, it's still there.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.880
Absolutely.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:26.600
Like until, until much of the old guard keeping, keeping that old culture alive, retire or otherwise

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.360
leave the company.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.520
AKA your last boss.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520
Yep.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520
Yep.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.520
I saw that.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520
Yeah.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520
The, it's,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.360
That's going to be, and let me just a quick tangent.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.160
That's going to be interesting to watch.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:48.020
So my old VP is retiring and how shall I put this without being, I don't think anybody

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:53.500
in my old team is educated enough to listen to the podcast except for, except for Dan.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.660
Hey, Dan.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.940
It's going to be interesting politically what happens because that org, but push me over

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.540
the top and leaving, that org was built around people.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.210
And this is not, you know, I, I, I think teams is doing well.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.610
It's great.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.650
This is not spiteful, but that team, the frustrating part, the biggest frustration

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:23.380
for me on that team was a leader who surrounded himself with people who sucked up to him.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:33.110
And that is not my vision of building a good engineering or a good culture on a team.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:40.030
So I wonder what's going to happen with someone coming in to replace him who I know of vaguely

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:46.210
it's a way different style, how that's going to work and how fearful some of those people

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.270
should be about their continued success in that organization.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.970
Yeah, I don't know who's, I think there's some, and it's weird that you have to

00:18:53.970 --> 00:19:00.330
worry in a company like that, like this, that, wherever they are, Microsoft, those political

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.730
things, those, those, those bits become very, very important.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.290
But anyway, let's go back to where are we at?

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.210
Satya, we skipped bomber, but bombers, a whole story we want to get to know.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.450
We're going to get into that one.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:21.850
So the one thing the important in the, the yes, there, there are some things that,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:30.250
Bill Gates era that still persists and it's, it's a negative aspect of the culture in my

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.930
humble opinion.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:38.710
And it turns out based off of a report I saw recently of Bill's opinion too.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.600
But he, he's like fine wine, man.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.280
He's mellowed with age.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:52.200
He, he, he, his focus on innovating was critical to this company.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.080
And it was a big part of why our stock.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.360
1 million percent agree, if that were possible.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.360
So I'll go with a hundred.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.420
Yeah.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.630
Now bomber era.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:21.200
So Bill Gates brought Microsoft to number one on all sorts of bars, including capitalization.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.480
Meaning here we were the most valuable company on the stock market.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.440
Now there's consequences that come with that.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:42.560
And one of my favorite authors, Stephen Blank wrote a bunch of studies on this is that because

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:50.060
of the free market, you're pushed to sort of continuously play the king of the hill game.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:21:01.110
And once you're the king of the hill, just by design, you end up having to defend your

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:07.920
position and that takes up so much energy, innovation stagnates.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:18.740
Now bomber grew up in sales and was beholden to the board.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:25.990
And we were in number one and the bomber decade was purely around how to defend our

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.820
position.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.820
Okay.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:35.190
Now there is a law that I've stated repeatedly on this one.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:47.030
Any time I call it, well, the law that I've coined states, he who is defensive loses always.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:51.880
You cannot win any game being defensive only.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:59.290
And Stephen Blank goes, that's actually the natural thing that happens to large enterprises

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.090
that are the king of the hill.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:07.480
And the biggest mistake that they make is they significantly underfund the innovation

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.960
in their desperate attempt to defend their sales.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.400
And at that time, there was a lot of confidence as well.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:23.840
Like I remember having conversations with my manager at the time and like we all knew

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:31.320
that Windows had, to build Windows, it had one quadrillion lines of code.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:40.200
No company was going to go from nothing to competition on that overnight, except unless

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:50.010
they start working through an agile paradigm and prioritizing building one little incremental

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.290
piece of code at a time that satisfies the customer's needs.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.330
Fast forward, Android OS as an example.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.570
So I have an experience, yes, and I fully agree.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.930
And I have an experience that from the bomber area, from one of his, I guess it'd be one

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:12.520
of his skip levels, so his down, it's one of the exact VPs at the time.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:18.040
I was at some leadership training and he was our guest presenter talking about operating

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.570
systems and networking, et cetera.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:32.440
I asked, because this is the time when Chrome OS wasn't around, it was thought of, it wasn't

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:39.680
really out there, and I asked him if, say, given the amount of knowledge work that is

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:47.340
done in the browser today, do you see any reason for Microsoft to make a lightweight

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:55.500
OS that could be used on lower cost computers for browser-based work?

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.500
Which I think makes a lot of sense.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:04.500
It's not like Chrome OS has swept the industry or anything, but whether or not I'm not the

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.260
marketer that figures out what the next thing is is going to win, but I felt like there

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.620
was something there and I was curious about his opinion.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:16.360
And his answer was literally, but you can't play games on those and on Windows you can

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360
play games.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.870
And I think that epitomizes, it's a defense of like, we have something that does this while

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.790
we want to do something else.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.510
We have, we've solved that problem.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.550
You can do games and use a browser.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:37.790
If I classify the Bill Gates era as sort of competitive innovation, right, bomber era was

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:41.130
competitive sales.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:48.730
We shifted from a growth approach to trying to protect our revenue.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:49.730
What was the bomber era?

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.610
Do you recall when he started and stopped so I can frame that in my career?

00:24:53.610 --> 00:25:01.240
It was around 10 years and no, I don't.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.240
It's on Wikipedia.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.240
All right.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.680
Early 2000s to about 10 years later.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.910
All right.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:15.880
When bombers leadership, for example, Sanofsky used his position as the head of Windows, which

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:25.280
was the cash cow at the time or one of them to sort of influence features in other teams.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:33.750
They were driving towards the only thing that matters is protecting Windows sales.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.750
And.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.270
How'd that work out in the long term?

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.350
I think time has shown.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:48.500
So the one thing with the bomber eras is that is actually when we were, when the tech era

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:54.300
was strongly shifting between different worlds.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.100
That's the shift to more of a services.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.620
It's the shift to the cloud.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.660
I remember watching all that happen and we were slow to adapt as a company.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:10.500
That had been in many ways, not just in software, but in how software was made, engineering

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.860
approaches a leader.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.100
We had, you know, I was in the room.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.140
We talked about the S debt title and now we can't get rid of the title.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.140
I'm very sorry.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.620
Industry with the shift to cloud.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.660
We did not innovate.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.860
We followed for a long time in that area.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.980
There were teams doing, doing real.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.890
There were organizations doing things like blue, green deployments, testing and production

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.960
while we were still focusing on building up our environment.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:46.090
Here's the thing that I learned as you know from my, my job history.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:53.860
Bing has already figured it out, but they hadn't figured out a way to generalize it

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.860
to everyone else.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.660
And I remember being, being like, Oh, you're not like us.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.540
Well, we can never learn from you.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.860
We had talks about being in, we had a talk with how agile worked in being being, you're

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.860
right.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:12.800
Bing was probably, they might've been right there with the industry if not slightly ahead,

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.400
but definitely not as behind as some other orgs were, but that didn't happen.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:24.840
But the thing is Bing, because they were fighting a, not only a losing battle, but

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.200
a severely losing battle with Google.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:37.170
And at the same time, we were strongly trying to defend our, our sales.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:43.110
Even if they had the leadership that, that could influence the rest of Microsoft, it

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.510
wouldn't have happened because all the other motivators were in the wrong direction.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:48.510
Okay.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:58.510
Satya part of his prior career is guess what organization he once had.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.760
Bing.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.160
Like he was well suited for understanding this new world.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.320
He had already been doing it for almost a decade.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:14.750
And the way I would classify Satya's thing right now is he's gone back to innovation,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.910
but it's collaborative innovation now.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:17.910
Okay.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.030
That's new in the last three years.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.510
That's new.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:28.310
He's very clear on his messages here, but he's also very clear that there's a lot of

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:34.590
work to do to shift that culture internally to be a lot more collaborative.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:39.090
There's still, for example, my team.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:46.090
I'm doing a lot of work that benefits all of Azure, but I am funded by one specific

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.240
team within Azure.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:58.240
My PM is an entirely different organization, an entirely different organization.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.760
We are an example of cross-group collaboration success.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:11.640
However, there's still enough of the old world practice that I am constantly worried,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:20.720
wondering around when am I going to be notified of the reorg that moves my team

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.440
into the same organization as that PM.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.120
Thus killing cross-group.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.000
And one of the arguments I'm finding right now is actually me being outside of that

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:40.840
group actually strengthens the forward progress because I can ignore their

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.160
particular politics that may actually slow me down and they can ignore mine.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.400
So it allows us a little bit more adaptability, a little bit more agility.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:30:01.300
But we still have budget concerns, so there's still a semblance of competitiveness,

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:07.800
but the review has definitely softened on that front.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.070
And yeah, we still have a lot more to do.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:17.910
But the biggest thing in my view is that he's really pushing on innovation on

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.110
this one.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:27.800
And if you read the news on the Microsoft stock quotes, there are now financial

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.480
advisors going with Microsoft motivation.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.080
It's a matter of time before we're number one.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.720
All right.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.480
So I would re-summarize your errors as Bill Gates is drive for innovation.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.440
Steve Ballmer is defend where we are and Stagnate.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:51.970
And Satya is let's put the bullshit behind us and try and actually win again.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:52.810
Sure.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.490
How does that work?

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:54.530
That works for me.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.770
I had a few reviews of Satya before I left.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.650
I was in the room and I talked to him.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.890
Very level-headed, very, I believe from my interaction with him,

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.250
I believe what you're saying.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:11.770
My frustration definitely with James Whitaker's frustration is how slow the

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.320
ship is moving because of the old guard.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.720
Yeah, I completely agree.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.240
And you said win again and I want to tweak that because he is really driving that

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.720
and again, it's going slower than I think you and I would want,

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.120
but definitely Whitaker would want, but he is pushing towards it.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.390
Whitaker even mentioned it in his last article.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.030
He loved what Satya is doing.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.370
The only complaint, too slow.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:46.320
I mentioned earlier the humanitarian efforts and the carbon stuff.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:52.760
Satya is pushing to have Microsoft win, but also to have the world win.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.040
Yeah, and you look, if Bill Gates is still in charge of the company,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.080
he'd be doing the same thing today because that's what he's working on.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.880
Probably would be, I agree.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.960
I think it was more of the young let's go out and make something exciting happen.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.440
And I don't recall if Bill is still the chairman.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:16.550
I think he is, but Bill absolutely has influence over the board.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.590
But he's just not the CEO.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.270
Yep.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.510
And in fact, I didn't go to any of them, but during the bomber area,

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:28.170
there were still regular Bill G reviews with teams.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.100
He would still come in for reviews frequently.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.500
And that I think was part of their thing.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:41.540
Like between the two of them, right, they always had the strong partnership

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.660
relationship.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.660
He was the...

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.140
Yep.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:52.550
He was always the tech guy, and bomber was sort of the charismatic sales guy.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:57.130
Now, going back to...

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.650
So we started this, and I realized I'd never close on this.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:03.650
So there's advice I give people who try to go and talk to their executive.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:11.830
Like you told the story around PM coming in, and Bill could immediately see

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:15.720
where fact was and where hand weaving was.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:21.150
When you were building a deck for an executive, the first and foremost thing

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:28.200
you should understand is that they cannot scale.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.160
They cannot know the details.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:39.280
So they have optimized, and they have practiced, and they have gained skills

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.120
in entering one question and one question only.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:52.930
And that is, can I blindly trust this guy to lead this mission?

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:59.970
So when you're doing a presentation to those folks, your number one goal

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:07.070
needs to express confidence that you got this.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:14.140
And different executives will have different bullshitometers,

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:20.600
but understand they're using it every single time, because they are accountable

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:25.200
for so many things that you do not understand, and you will often not even

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:31.100
get enough time on their schedule to know how...

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:36.870
To what degree your aspect of this is important to their mission.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:41.350
Yes, I'm looking up a tweet, because actually Angie...

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:41.790
What kind of...

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.690
I can't find this.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.250
I mentioned this on Twitter.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.770
She had a question on Twitter around...

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.850
I'm at the paraphrase, because I can't find the tweet on my phone.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:56.000
She asked about internal presentations versus external presentations,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.840
and what do you do differently?

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.280
And I said...

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.080
I replied, because I have an opinion.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.680
I have three presentations I give.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.120
External presentations are about entertainment.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.420
Okay.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.860
Internal talks to my team are highly interactive.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.540
I wouldn't do an interactive for a keynote.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.460
It's like, let's get stuff out here.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.740
We'll talk about it, ask questions as they go a lot.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.460
Exec presentation is...

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.320
I think I said also for external tell stories entertain.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:35.880
For execs, also tell stories, but using carefully researched and well-backed up

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.370
data and not going off on any tangents.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.650
You have to communicate confidence.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.370
Yes.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:44.450
That's it.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.450
Yeah.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.450
And I tell...

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.450
I tell...

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.450
Yes.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.650
And then be ready for any question at any time and have a confident answer.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.090
That's not just preparing the presentation for confidence.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.650
It's preparing the...

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.840
It's having the background at tip of tongue.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.560
I have a different perspective than that for that question.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:09.920
Like number one, if you are doing a presentation, the purpose of every presentation is to entertain

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.920
your audience.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.210
Right?

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.050
A lot of people go, no, it's to inform your audience.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.050
No, it's not.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.530
It's different between a...

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.770
Like my external presentation is more of a...

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.720
I'll put it this way.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.320
My presentation to execs is a documentary.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.200
Still entertaining, but full of data and information.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.320
You do it in a way that gets them excited.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.320
Yes.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:38.980
You have to do a different style if it's a right only presentation versus a read-write

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.980
one.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.500
And here I mean writing a keynote.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.830
You're right.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.190
You got to be doing all the talking.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.190
It's definitely not my preference.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:54.720
I prefer the give and take with the crowd.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.280
But that doesn't scale at a certain size.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:05.320
In my view, the difference...

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:11.680
So Alan is better at presenting than I am, but my difference between internal and external

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.120
is external.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:22.340
I will scrub corporate IP and then on internal, I basically remove the fluff slides from the

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:27.360
external to give room for interaction.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.720
That's my difference.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720
Yeah.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.720
I...

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720
There's not much.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.240
In fact, I may take a couple of the presentations I gave internally at an internal conference

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.480
and give the exact same presentation externally.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.560
I have very little corporate IP.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.360
I add some numbers, which I think are public.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.720
Well, we're not a public company, so they're not.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720
So I'm doing...

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720
I would have to scrub a little bit.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.760
I'm doing a lot of data science presentations and...

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.460
Yeah, just put a bunch of math.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.460
Yeah.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:38:01.780
So, if you're doing math in a data science presentation, I kind of find that pointless

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.340
because you can just say, hey, look, here's a link to Wikipedia.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.540
Go look up the math.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.540
Right?

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:13.500
The data that I would be presenting almost always represents IP.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.200
So I have to be very careful with that.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.650
Understood.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:18.650
Tell stories.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.170
Anyway, are we done?

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.650
I'm not that we have time to get to anything else, but I want to make sure...

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:30.630
Was there anything else on the Gates-Bomber-Sautia era?

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.050
Did you ever present anything to Bomber?

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:41.660
I had a word once, very simple interaction.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.920
He and I shared an elevator.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.960
And I'm like, he looks familiar.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.800
And I just looked at him and he looked at me like, what are you trying to figure out?

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.620
And I'm like, you're Steve, aren't you?

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.540
And he said yes.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.540
Excellent.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.540
Excellent.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.540
Have a great day.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.540
What a dork.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.540
What a dork.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:09.780
Well, so apparently I had not hidden my body language enough, so he looked at...

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.580
I mean, he was clearly going, sup.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.350
Yeah.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.990
I just tried to figure out...

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.190
Because you look a lot like him.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.270
There's an anecdote from the Bomber era where...

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.510
Developers, developers, developers.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.110
Well, that was actually during...

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.950
He said that during the Bill G era.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:28.950
Correct.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:33.470
But during the Bomber era, he did snatch someone's iPhone out of their hand and throw it on

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.630
the ground at a company meeting.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:37.630
Yeah.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.310
And again, defend versus innovate.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.760
It's like, wow, this is taking off.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.680
Maybe we should make a bunch of apps for this.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160
No.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160
So...

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160
You'd have to go...

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.160
That defense...

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.480
So like here, this is one of the things, and this is something that I will state over

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.190
and over again, because every now and again, I run into something like this.

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:02.910
Teams that kind of will go, oh, you're duplicating our effort.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:03.910
I'm like, no.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:04.910
Right.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:10.890
I have developed a great strategy for when I get accused of that.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.330
But let's go back to modern testing principles.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.330
Right.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:15.730
That actually drives me on this one.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.990
And this is, in my view, Bomber did do that.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.170
And I think it was a tragic mistake.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:29.930
Like look, Bomber, we had the Windows phone and it was competing with iPhone and we were

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.290
at least three years late.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.290
Okay.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.000
Yes and no.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.280
I had a touchscreen phone with Wi-Fi in my hand years before the iPhone came out.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.880
But here's the thing.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:54.630
Even if Bomber was able to, we'll call it, negatively motivate all of Microsoft to go to

00:40:54.630 --> 00:41:00.250
Windows Phone, and I don't remember, there was a period early on in his where we would

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.630
all get Christmas gifts.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.110
Like we all got a Surface.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.110
I used the...

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.110
Did we get a phone?

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.110
I don't recall.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.110
Yeah, I got phones for years.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.110
Right.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:18.060
And like in terms of the market that we're trying to go into, even if all of Microsoft

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:24.620
were users, if they weren't vocal advocates, then all you're going to get is Microsoft

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.620
and that is a blip on that market.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.620
Right.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.620
It is small.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.660
It's not even a blip.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.140
A blip.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.140
A blip.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.140
A blip.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:41.060
And that's part of the thing I think was strategically in error, just quite honestly.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.220
And that's the point I was getting at.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.820
I think not looking...

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.220
And that's, I think Bomber also epitomized the...

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.620
It was all about not invented here during that time especially.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:59.420
It was not just for the internal tools like we've talked about, but we didn't look

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:06.020
about how we could, we as Microsoft at the time, could take advantage of and interact

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.820
with the changes that were happening.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.300
We talked about web stuff.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.820
The phone growth happened there too.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:20.140
And we saw it through our competitive colored glasses instead of, okay, what...

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.140
How do we...

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.700
Instead of principle number five.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.180
How do we ride the wave?

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.260
Like I said, instead of principle number five.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.260
Right.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:34.700
We had phone products and we were doing pretty well with them.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.300
The ones that were all on the WinCEOS.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:43.100
I loved my PDA phone, if you remember those things.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.820
Yes, I do.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.620
But Apple was out innovating us.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.940
When we came out with Zoom, Apple was like, oh yeah, that's pretty neat.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.700
Hey, have you seen our iPhone?

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.260
Like we were three years behind and still trying to play...

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.260
We didn't quite...

00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.740
We tried to play catch up.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.740
Yes.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.100
And in those phases, you can't play follow the leader.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.780
You have to play leapfrog.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.780
Right.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.780
Right.

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.780
And that's what's missing.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.940
It's like, how do you leapfrog instead of follow the leader?

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.940
I like that.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:21.840
And the thing is, I actually thinking back, I think a lot of the bomber era in analyzing

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:29.720
what happened, what went well, what didn't, helped influence my opinion around the modern

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.600
testing principles.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.040
Absolutely.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.280
Because I kept on...

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:40.040
By that point in time, I was teaching people how to do agile migrations.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:45.550
And I don't know if you remember this, I'm sure you will once I bring it up.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:50.710
Bomber had division by division sort of talking events with principle level folks.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.390
Oh, I remember those, yes.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:59.070
And I remember that I had already talked to three teams and major teams that go through

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.510
this agile transition.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:09.010
When I first heard a bomber stayed out of his mouth, that we needed to shift to agile.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:10.010
Huh.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.530
Anyway, we got to go.

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:12.530
All right.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.720
Yep.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.720
See ya.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:15.740
Bye.
