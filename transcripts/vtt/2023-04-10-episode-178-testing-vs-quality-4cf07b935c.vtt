00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
That doesn't translate into quality software, which is what I care about far more.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.440
Who cares if a crummy product that nobody uses is well tested.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.300
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.980
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.260
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.780
Now on with the show.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.970
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.010
This is Alan.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.530
And once again, I am pissed off at Zencaster.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.090
But Zencaster Alan is the easiest way to record your VoIP podcast interviews in studio quality.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.130
I got to tell you when it works, it is awesome.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.210
And honestly, I would pay money for it if you guaranteed me it would work.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.090
But I have none such confidence.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.940
Here's what happened.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.220
Let me recap y'all.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.620
And then the Zencaster algorithm is going to sneak in,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.020
hear my voice and blow the whole thing up.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.140
But Brent was late.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.420
What's new?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.170
And then I started I just as I was starting to record without him and it was good.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.250
I had a speech going and it was awesome.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.930
Brent showed up and then Brent was coming out the wrong speaker because

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.690
Zencaster can't read it settings from a hole in the wall.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.730
That's a horrible metaphor.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.850
But you know what I mean?

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.970
What I have to do is I have to change the speaker from the one that's correct to something else,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.210
then back to the one that's correct, and then it works fine.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.810
And then I pressed record and then Zencaster restarted for both of us.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.850
And it went back to the broken way, had to do it again.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.050
Now here we are.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.170
Welcome to the ZenB Caster or something.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.690
Anyway, when it's good, it's great.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.730
So when it's annoying, it's really, really annoying.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.410
And I'm happy to have someone from Zencaster on the podcast to talk us through it.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.410
And honestly, we're getting value from it.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.490
So maybe it's all right.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.210
How you doing, Brent?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.530
I'm doing all right.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.810
I'm currently looking up to see how we can get someone on the podcast.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:19.250
Oh, how Berlin like they publish their looks like they publish their Twitter handles for.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.490
Good.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.050
We'll ask them.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.690
We'll ask them to come on and they can just come because, you know, we have had to be clear.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.490
Zencaster has worked perfectly for us a few times.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.090
And meanwhile, over in the left pane, I see one recording of 31 seconds and one recording of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.370
zero, zero seconds.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.730
Neither of the ones which will be published, but we appear to be recording now.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.530
So, okay, enough with Zencaster.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.090
We just talked last week and we talked a lot about AI.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.450
I talked about a lot of the reasons why I left my old job.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.210
And maybe this time we'll get to talking about what's next.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.770
But first, can we talk about how freaking stupid I am?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.360
Like we've beaten that horse to death.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.520
No, we talk about how stupid you are, Brent.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.600
Oh, oh, I misinterpreted.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.000
So every year, every year, you don't know what this is and stop typing while I'm talking.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.620
Like, actually, it's better for you to type when I'm talking than when you're talking.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.260
Because if you're I want, I can edit one.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.220
I just poke myself in the eyes around every year.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.020
Every year, I have a reminder on my calendar in March to sign up for the lottery.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.820
Brent is banging on a fucking can on his side.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.950
Let me finish that thought before people think I'm all about buying lottery tickets.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.070
Every year, I sign up for the lottery to get early access to the Wonderland Trail.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.150
Ninety nine point nine percent of our three listeners, including Brent,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.910
do not know what the Wonderland Trail is.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.990
The Wonderland Trail is this trail that goes all the way around Mount Rainier.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.250
It is freaking amazing and beautiful and awesome.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.250
And every year I want to go do it.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.050
And every year I do not get selected for the lottery.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.930
And if you don't get the lottery, you can try and figure out campsites,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.330
but it's painful and just it's it's really difficult to make work.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.290
So this year, for the first time ever, I got accepted into the Wonderland lottery.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.460
And Brent's applauding.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.340
And Tuesday morning was the day that I could begin to go get reservations

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.180
because we open up for just a lottery winners.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.300
And I completely forgot.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.580
So I remember today as I was one of the things I did on Fridays is clean out my email.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.300
I was going through and I saw that and my stomach dropped to the ground.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.780
And I just I went ahead and went in the.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.620
Was it Tuesday and Tuesday only or are you competing?

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.900
Up Tuesday.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.460
So what happened is everybody else had lottery access,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.260
which is not a small number and there's a limited number of campsites.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.820
There are specific places you can camp on the Wonderland Trail because of the bear issues.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.500
And they have bear precautions for food at those camps

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.700
and also just trying to limit the people so it stays awesome and beautiful.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.140
And so open Tuesday.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.700
So Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, most of the day Friday here,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.460
people have been filling out their itineraries.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.780
And I go and of course, the days I wanted to go, there's no campsites available.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.260
And luckily I was able to do some.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.380
And here's the deal you're trying to it's 95 miles.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.140
So you're trying to figure out and lots of ups and downs trying to figure out a

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.660
sustainable pace to get around this thing.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.900
And I had an itinerary all worked out.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.900
It was so it was nice.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.780
It was like nine to 12 miles a day, which is a lot when you're going up and down steeply.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.780
Anyway, it was it was perfect.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.500
It was perfect.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.060
It was perfect.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.820
None of those campsites are available.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.700
So I am doing some weird like 16 mile days and a week later that I wanted to go.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.660
But it should be all right.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.140
And I'm a little bummed about it.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.660
Just happened like a half hour ago.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.780
It's like, oh, no.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.260
So that was that's me being stupid.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.860
But then I was smart today, too.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.020
But we can talk about that in a minute.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.700
Any comments you want to go on the one I only booked one seat.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.940
So you have you have.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.900
Oh, so you're just going to go off by yourself?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.060
Yeah.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.500
Okay.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.780
So this one, is this the big like bucket list trip you've been talking about?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.900
No, no, the bucket.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.660
The bucket some day is the Pacific Crest Trail.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.700
That'll take about four months.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.750
Ah, okay.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.150
Okay.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.790
This is 93 miles 16.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.510
So what is that?

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.990
Two weeks?

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.190
Nine days.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.500
PCT is interesting.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.060
And I've always wanted to do it.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.540
But ever since that dumb movie came out about it around eight years ago,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.980
it's gotten super popular.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.410
And as you know, and as our listeners know, all three of you, I do not like people.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.660
Thus why he's going camping for nine days by himself.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.700
Yeah, that's okay.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.460
That one's pretty limited.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.420
Most of the campsites only hold like five to 10 people.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.260
So it stays once you spread out.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.700
It's pretty you don't see people much on the Wonderland is what I'm led to believe.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.390
PCT is also a permit system.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.700
Pacific Crest Trail, but there's so many people on it.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.580
And what happens there is a whole bunch of people get excited.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.540
They watch the movie.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.700
They think, Oh, I'm going to go do this thing.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:25.500
And they somehow managed to get one of there's 50 spots a day going from Mexico.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.150
And I would guess half of them don't make it the first 300 miles.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.600
But for those first 300 miles, there's a shit ton of people around.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.990
So one thing.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.790
If you can make it to 300, you're good.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.830
Then it spreads out.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.230
Yeah.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.260
And unfortunately, because I move kind of fast, I would, if I did it from Mexico,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.900
I would shoot.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.860
We're way off in the weeds here, but I'm happy to share this one.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.700
I got to find the time and I can get four months off.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.580
That's a whole other story.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:02.240
But if I would start late and be passing people, so I'd see more people until,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.920
you know, Northern California or so, and they're all eventually gone.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.280
I've been thinking really hard.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.660
You know, the vast majority of people do it from Mexico to Canada.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:18.370
I've been thinking about going the other way just to avoid seeing starting at Canada and

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.010
going to Mexico just to avoid seeing as many people.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.050
There's advantages and disadvantages.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.890
The disadvantage is you're starting off with some huge up and downs in Washington going South.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.300
Right.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.820
But once you get over that, it's all downhill from here.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.140
Yes.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.380
Yeah.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:35.540
Yeah.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.180
Yeah.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:46.270
But the thing is, though, then you end your hike dealing with the zombie horde.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.780
No, because you're starting much later.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:56.060
So if you start from the you're trying to dodge the PCT these days between getting the snow,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.150
the hell out of your way before the the forest fires come.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.690
So if you're starting from the South and you usually start like an April.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.410
Some may some March, but April ish.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.060
But if you're starting if you're starting from Washington, get away from the snow to melt.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.060
You don't even leave till July, mid July.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.720
So if you go south and you're going from July to November and you're ending up in the desert

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.720
in November, which is cold at night, but doable.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.460
And if you're starting south, then you start in April and end up in August.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.530
Anyway, something for me to figure out.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.170
I don't know.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.970
This is just something to get away from people and get some exercise.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.250
Take some good pictures.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.690
Try not to eat and buy a bear.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.490
It's fun for me.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.330
So, yeah, but I totally blew the reservation system.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.620
I feel really dumb, but I did something else today that was something I don't normally do,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.060
but it's actually maybe even a topic for the podcast.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.740
So let's pause on that.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.580
Anything you want to touch on from your life, from your your dreams and fantasies,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.940
your no, but never mind.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.500
No, I had a I had a weird dream last night.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:17.630
I fell asleep watching watching Tournament of Champions, which is a it's a upleveled

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.350
chef competition show.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.990
Love chef competition shows.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:28.510
Yeah, it's basically they have like the winners of Iron Chef competing against the winners of

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.590
Top Chef.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.830
Right.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.310
Like it's super high bar.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:38.910
And I fell asleep watching it and I had this weird dream where suddenly Guy Fieri

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.270
was cheering me on and I was one of the chefs.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.790
And it's rare for me to remember my dreams lately.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:52.050
But this one, I'm like, you know, it reminded me, I used to always say that

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:57.420
whenever I retired from Microsoft, I would go to culinary school.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.500
You know, I always thought about being a smelly or a chef as well.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.420
I can see you being a sommelier.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:15.980
My son, like just to give you a sense, my son, my interest and desire to around around cooking

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.540
is so strong.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:25.500
He was seriously considering going into that as a career because his his bar was essentially,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.460
let me just do the things that dad seems to be interested in.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.020
Quite honestly, he hadn't come up with his own goal himself.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:42.640
He's now almost graduated and I was positive to say he's he's realized he and I had a conversation

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.160
about a month ago and he's like, dad, I can't stand coding.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.760
I cannot stand it.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.150
Hatred.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:57.230
But I want the CS and I want and I said, well, talk to me about the things

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.150
that you kind of want to do.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:04.530
He's like, without boring our audience, long story short, he wants to be a PM.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:12.430
And I'm like, OK, well, let me introduce you to a few folks and then start directing it.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.950
And the other thing he's very fascinated about is cybersecurity.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:22.300
And I'm like, oh, yeah, that one will be good for you.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.020
He's right now at Walt Disney World.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.380
Did I tell you this?

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:26.540
No.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:34.350
He and his fiance are part of the Walt Disney World College Program.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.950
So like you've been to Walt Disney World, I presume.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.070
I have not.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.950
You have not.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.150
I don't go to Florida.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.400
OK.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.000
Walt Disney World, a large portion of their staff are essentially college level people

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.640
from all around the world, and they accepted both of them.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.360
So they're they're working Walt Disney World for the next six months.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.420
Like he was working one of the glow carts.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.180
I don't know if you've seen this, but most of these amusement parks,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:12.620
like they have these carts with shiny, spinny things, particularly when it's parade time.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.140
And he he talked me this today and he's like, oh, yeah, me and my partner.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.980
We sold a bunch of these things.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.060
And but anyway, he got an opportunity.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:28.300
Their IT department connected him or connected with him just out of the blue.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.660
They're like, hey, we see that you have a C.S. degree or you're working on it.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.860
We have this opportunity.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.660
Do you want it?

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.130
He's like, yeah, I don't fully understand the opportunity,

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:44.450
but apparently it's combined C.S. data engineering, data science and customer connection.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.210
And he's just he's super pumped about it.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.490
He wants to be a generalist.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.990
That and I'm supportive of me too.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.310
Me too.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.630
Next week, spring break.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.310
So you asked my news.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.430
My daughter is doing a class trip.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.630
Both I and my wife.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.790
You're going to Philadelphia in Washington, D.C.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.830
Yeah.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.910
So we talked about this before drink.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.670
That happens starting Monday.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.850
Nice. Nice.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.650
Not been to that part of the world.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.730
I'll say right now.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.570
I don't know what I'll be most excited about retroactively.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:29.810
I'm sure this is one of the things that I have picked up from Fallout, right?

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:37.900
Because Fallout does such a great job sort of modeling what the area of the world would look

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.660
like in an apocalypse.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.060
You then go and look, you then go to the real place and you go like,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.340
damn, those Fallout guys, they did a really exceptional job.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.980
And with Fallout 4 being all about the Boston area, I'm like, you know, I would love to go to

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.940
Boston even more now just because of the real historical context.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.020
So I've done the opposite.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:08.340
I've done extensive walking, self-guided walking tours of Boston before playing Fallout 4.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.300
Okay.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.740
And when you play.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.260
It would be fun to go back.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:19.220
I have definitely walked more of Boston in Fallout 4 than I did over days and days of it in person.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.220
So the question though, though, though, when you played Fallout 4, right?

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.300
Did you go like, I have totally been there.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.390
Like, did you?

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:27.790
Yes.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.510
In a couple of places.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.070
Yes.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.550
Yeah.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.030
So for Vegas, that's what happened with me.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:42.060
Anyway, so part of my bucket list is certainly to do historical visit, historical sites.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.660
Excited about going to D.C.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.220
I don't know that we're going to see the White House, but we're definitely going to see

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.980
the Lincoln Memorial.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.420
So that should be cool.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.340
I will actually have a Philly cheesesteak from Philly.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.630
Right.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.190
I did that.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.430
Yeah.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.470
Yeah.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.510
But I was going to say.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.470
You are far more traveled than I am.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.310
I still have not been to Europe.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.350
All right.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.790
I'm going to push off the, we have to have an AI discussion chat, GPT discussion.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.070
We do.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.510
I thought we're going to avoid it this time.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.910
Can we ever really?

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.100
Oh, right.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:19.260
Can we?

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.060
So it was interesting.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:28.560
There was, I don't normally respond to random posts on LinkedIn.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.680
I shouldn't even say random.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.720
I don't normally respond to posts on LinkedIn.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.300
Often it is not worth the effort.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.210
Okay.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.930
So do you find, as an aside, do you find

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:51.010
responding to posts on LinkedIn has less ROI in general than on Twitter?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.210
Oh, that's a good question.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.610
People want longer answers, so it's different.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.810
There's a lot more posturing on LinkedIn these days.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.130
And Twitter is kind of turning into a ghost town.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:01.650
Yeah.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:07.730
So, but there was one struck something with me and it was from, and you've, you've,

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.730
you've still, he still works at Microsoft.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.970
You've crossed paths with Wayne Roseberry before.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.130
And he has a lot of good insightful posts and he's someone who's still doing,

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.010
at Microsoft, still doing mostly testing as his job.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.290
So I'm, I know there's very little of those rules like that.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.730
So it's interesting, but good for him.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.610
And he's still still doing that?

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:26.850
Yeah.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:27.010
Yeah.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:27.250
Yeah.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:32.370
And he's telling a story about where he wrote some automation to open and

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.530
close word a bunch of times and found a memory leak.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.970
And it reminded me of a story I told in, uh, how we test software at Microsoft.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.810
And I promised someone a while back, I can't remember who, that I would write the

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.050
15 years later reader's guide to that book.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.050
And I'll do that this year sometime, but it reminded me, there's a story I wrote on

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:50.850
windows CE.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.170
If you remember the Mira client, which was a stupid thing, there was this idea.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:01.010
Remember this is 19, uh, might've been 2000, 2001, but the idea was the idea

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.840
for a device was when we sold a couple of these, it's like a computer monitor,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.080
like sitting on your desk, like, like you'd have a pad,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.950
like managing using an iPad as your, as your monitor.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:17.550
Anyway, the idea was when you undocked it, you could walk away with it and it would

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.230
immediately become a terminal server client logging into your machine.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.190
So basically you're taking your computer with you on a monitor.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.430
This was before we had the idea of what a tablet was and it worked, but it was dumb.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.990
It was heavy.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.710
It was expensive.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.190
It was too hard to use on the toilet.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:37.630
I think was the, um, the final review that said it wasn't going to happen.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.590
Is that what killed it?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.650
Maybe, maybe.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:49.680
Um, so I added a story, the paraphrased short version of what I put in the book

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.520
saying that brute force automation sometimes is interesting because I, I did the same

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:55.840
thing there.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:02.560
I wrote a little script, not in selenium, not in Appium, not in any of that crap.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.880
I just wrote a little wind 32 app that found the control, clicked on it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.320
And then, uh, found the control in the frame for the terminal server and click

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.840
disconnect and just looped.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:19.860
I don't know why it felt fun to do, but after about 20 minutes, my test crashed.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.270
And I thought immediately the thing you think, wow, I must've wrote some

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.630
crummy wind 32 code.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:26.510
So I looked at it.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.790
It looked fine.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.360
I cleaned it up a little bit, added some logging, ran it again.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.920
And in 20 minutes, it crashed again.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.120
That's okay.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.160
This time I'll look at it in the debugger and sure enough, leaking GDI objects and

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.560
it crashed because windows see you didn't have that much memory.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.480
That's all just the same story told a different way from a Wayne tool.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.040
But then I said the thing I always say, which is I'm gonna say it again.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.320
I wish more testers and developers used automation as a discovery mechanism rather

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.620
than stupidly trying to automate a bunch of user workflows, which I have

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.620
been saying for at least a decade.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.140
Stop it.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.620
In fact, it was like over 10 years ago, I gave my talk on stop writing automation,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.540
but nobody listens to me, Brent.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.060
Nobody listens.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:19.020
There are hundreds of thousands of people out there writing user workflow

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.860
automation and Selenium, Appium, test cafe, uh, Cyprus, this and that,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.580
spending all their time writing user workflow automation.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.540
Why, Brent?

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.140
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.370
Yeah, it's, it's, uh,

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.050
big test auto.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.710
Okay.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.950
Yeah.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:44.910
You just one small voice and you know, the big test automation, uh, you know,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:50.030
and their lobbyists, they're out to get you just a snowball and they're in their heat wave.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.510
Sorry.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.510
I write that and I go to the gym.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:59.600
So I had some time this morning and I'm at the gym and I get a little notification

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.270
that says Michael Bolton has replied to your comment.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.710
Yeah, I'm staring at it.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.430
Your, your BFF was just like, yeah.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:12.750
And wait, wait to, um, wait a the story.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.510
Wait up.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.140
Nice.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.820
I, oh my God, this is why I don't reply on LinkedIn, but I checked and he says here,

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.980
here and, and gave a like to my post.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:31.260
Cause the idea is, is that one thing Michael Bolton and I can agree on is that writing

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:37.340
a bunch of user workflow UI automation is not that helpful.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:38.940
No, it's awful.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.380
It's, it's just terrible.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:51.020
As I mentioned before, James and Michael and I have this unwritten truce where we don't really,

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.580
we just kind of stay in our own lanes.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:59.820
Even when I wrote that post, remember the one where I said, I'm not all teams need

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.580
dedicated testers, which seems so brain dead, simple to me.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.900
Like, yeah, of course not all teams dedicated testers yet a whole bunch of testers got really

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.740
mad and said, I didn't know anything about testing and blah, blah, blah.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.900
And then tagged in Michael and James.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.460
That's what they do.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.940
They bring in the, bring in the grownups to come yell at me.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.340
They didn't yell at me as fast as they got was Bolton.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.620
So something about, well, this author doesn't do blah, blah, blah, which was wrong, but

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.060
I didn't take it like, yeah.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.780
Yeah.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.060
And I don't know if you saw it in that same post just before it.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:38.720
The issue is you validated, you accidentally went down the path of validating the whole

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.800
checking versus testing thing.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.400
That's the only reason why Michael here, here you did.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.330
I, I didn't, you didn't post.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.770
I didn't, I didn't validate any checking versus testing.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.930
No, but just before I, just before you posted,

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:02.930
Bolton replied to Wayne's thing and said, that was not an automated test.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.250
That was a test, right?

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.490
I didn't read anybody else's stuff.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.130
Whatever.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:08.690
Okay.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:15.730
No, but you were, that was you using your intellect, your skills, and a bit of code

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.370
to say it was an automated test is, is like saying that a hammer built the house.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:21.570
Right.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.770
Then he goes off into his weird checking versus testing metaphor.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.570
It was a test completely agree.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.250
And it was automated.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.850
I do not understand why it's not that simple.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:41.650
And then you said, so the way I think Bolton is translating it, the term automation is now a tool.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:49.730
I wish, wish more developers and testers used tools as a discovery mechanism

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.330
rather than trying to do a bunch of work.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.050
I do.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:54.450
I do.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:59.330
And if you think about, and this is a big, big point of mine, I've never understood

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:06.610
the interest other than a cool little demo to watch of trying to automate a user workflow.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.570
You use, you want to use, I'll call it test automation, test tools, whatever the hell ever.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:18.050
You want to use the power of programming to do the testing that is too difficult to do by hand.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.290
But if I want to create a thousand entries in an address book,

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.610
I'm not going to go create them one by one.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.050
I'm going to write a fricking loop.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:32.620
If I need to create any sort, I want, I can only use automation to do test data.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.740
If I want to understand, well, what happens if I do this action a million times,

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.860
I'm going to write myself a little program to do that and understand that I am not going to write

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:48.700
automation to put an item in the cart, open the cart, click on payment, enter a fake credit

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.540
card and make sure I get the sale done.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.180
I don't know how far too ridiculous you want to go with this conversation, but

00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:01.100
another blatant example is, okay, can my website handle a thousand simultaneous users?

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.460
Sure.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.740
Right. Do that as a manual test case.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.580
You call all your friends and you have them log into your stupid website.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.340
Even there, you can do some cool stuff using Postman.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.420
If it's out of your website, but it's an API and you want to simulate some requests,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.380
you can do it there or-

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:23.980
No, my point is doing it in the manual way is dumb AF is all I'm saying.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.100
Yes. Yes.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:25.420
Right.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.820
But that curiosity, here's what's wrong and here's where maybe we agree, but I don't want to go in,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:37.500
I mean, with Michael Bolton is I want to use automation to let me be curious about what

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:43.900
happens, not to satisfy some requirements. I know there's somebody, I can't remember their name,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.460
but they're in my feed and I haven't removed them yet, but they just post these esoteric

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.180
comments about testing that mean nothing.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.860
And I look at that, they always at the top of my feed because they post so often.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.660
I looked at one the other day and it was something around, oh God,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.380
now I just, it left my head because it was so stupid.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.140
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.020
It was, it'll come back to me later and I'll blurt it out.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:17.840
But I just, just want testers and that are testing people who do testing.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:24.480
And once again, research has shown that automated tests owned by the dev team have a high correlation

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.160
with quality and those written by the QA team do not have that correlation.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.440
So just want to throw that out there for those of you that have forgotten every time I bring it up,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.640
I used to have the page memorized.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.600
Yeah. So here's, here is, I don't know how you...

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.320
Hey look, it's AB Tester talking about testing. Welcome to the podcast.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.240
I'm not certain how you managed to successfully trigger me, but you have.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:49.920
It's my job.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:50.960
Testing.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.400
I'm good at my job.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.560
Testing this, at a high level, this is the thing that bothers me.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.720
Okay. And I think it's in alignment.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.560
There are a lot of people that we have spoken to in the present as well as in the past that

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.800
view testing as the goal.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.080
Yes.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:18.080
It's effing not. Testing is a means, not an end.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.840
Okay. Number one.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:28.110
Number two, when you are going through and it's understanding what the hell you're trying

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:32.110
to achieve, that's, I guess that's my other problem is that there's so many people who

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.510
don't even realize it's a means on an end.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:41.790
So they don't even have a sense of what's the end, the goal you're trying to achieve.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:47.710
Right. This is why principle number one is principle number one for MTP.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:56.700
Okay. Now, to generalize what you were saying just a second ago is, okay, if testing is a means

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:04.800
and not an ends, once I understand the ends, then I should be looking for the high ROI

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.240
ways to achieve those ends.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:18.580
To me, it's like, you know, we want to take a trip to Hawaii and, you know, we can start hiking down

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.820
the PCT. See what I did there?

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.900
Nice, nice, nice.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.140
Yeah.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:23.620
Yeah.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.060
You're not going to get there.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:31.660
You're not going to get there anytime soon, and you're going to have a big bottleneck at

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.700
some point in time.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.460
And let me just loop this into something you and I have both said before.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.500
Because this is exactly the difference.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.340
And I was trying to find the article real quick that where James wrote this, but I'm 99%

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.980
positive I read this and didn't dream it because why would I dream about James Block?

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.860
That would be weird.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.860
And again, I will not say anything here.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.100
If he wants to listen to the podcast, he won't, but nothing I wouldn't say to his face is you

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:02.860
and I have said, Brent, you and I have said many times we care about quality far, far more

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.380
than we care about testing.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:04.700
Yes.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.580
James has come out and said the opposite.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.980
It wasn't like the premise or the thesis of his, but he cares a lot about testing.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:12.540
That's fine.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.420
That's fine.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.540
I disagree with that as the thing to care about.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.060
But when I look at these folks who are doing what I'll call-

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.020
Well, if he's expressing his passion.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.340
His passion is testing, yes.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:32.540
And a lot of people like this, a school of we care about testing.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.820
Testing is super important.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.860
It's important that we have skilled people doing great testing.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:46.780
And while I can't disagree with the passion, to me, that doesn't translate into quality

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.660
software, which is what I care about far more.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.580
Who cares if a crummy product that nobody uses is well tested.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.500
The testers, maybe.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.820
Great, great.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.220
Yeah.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.180
That's fantastic.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.900
You're 100% right.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.260
That's the best kind of right.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:10.880
To me, he's basically saying, and good for him, right?

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.320
His talents, his going deep, that has helped society.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.200
Yeah, no.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.240
But his-

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.360
Did I just say, yeah, no.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.400
I'll explain that later.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:22.640
Go on.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:22.800
Yeah.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:30.560
But the acolytes that follow him, and here I specifically use the term acolytes,

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.440
right?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:38.640
It's the blind faith that then take his statements and misunderstanding, in my humble

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.520
opinion, I don't know if it's that actual misunderstanding, but misunderstanding that

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.960
he is stating this is what everyone should do.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.990
And it's not.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:54.030
He's saying he's going deep on this specific means.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.870
That's where his passion is.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.950
And great, great.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:58.990
Go for it.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:04.510
But from a business context, I'm going to stand by the side of it's a means, not an

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:05.390
ends.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:09.310
And I want to understand the ROI of alternatives.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:16.860
If there are multiple ways for me to achieve the ends, why would I do the one

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.460
why would I do this one versus the alternatives?

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:20.700
Yeah.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.140
And I'll be very, very clear here, because this is, I don't want to say just

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:26.700
preference.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.580
I'm not saying what James is doing is badmating.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.500
Because I think it's not.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.260
He's very good at what he does.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.860
Sometimes he's a jerk to people.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.860
And I don't want to go into that right now.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:44.300
But what we really are arguing about is, you know, given the preference of,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.020
could we have could we make a product that is our customers view as a quality

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.020
product, or could we make a product that we feel is well tested?

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.260
There's one that you and I would choose 10 times out of 10.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:01.820
And another one that people like James would choose 10 out of 10.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:08.700
The philosophical principle difference is that I believe that the customer

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.140
determines quality.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.500
So if they like it, it doesn't matter what kind of testing we did.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.300
Yeah.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:15.600
Yeah.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.880
And if I do, if I have the best testers in the world applying great testing to something

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:30.480
and doing things in a very thoughtical and using all the things from RST and customers

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.920
think the software is a piece of shit, I'm not proud of that work.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.200
No, I was just thinking because we just had this example of where we did a bunch of testing.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.200
And to be clear, there's an overlap.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.880
There's a Venn overlap here.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.400
I'm just saying if I can choose one, I choose quality.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.030
No, no.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.990
I mean, you, of course can choose one.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.870
Damn it, Paige, maybe lose my train of thought.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.110
That's what I do, man.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.990
That's my job.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.830
That's my job.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:03.070
Your job is to get me, what we learned is you have two jobs.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.390
Yeah.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:03.950
Wrap it up.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.150
We got to end early today.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:05.870
We started late.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.710
It's going to be a short podcast, which is much easier to listen to on your commute

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:12.190
because you can have a shorter commute and you're welcome.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.990
What were you going to say, man?

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:19.870
Oh, so you said if the customers love the product, I think you paraphrasing

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:26.370
customers, the product, then you said something like how does the testing matter?

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:26.930
I don't care.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.050
Yeah, I don't care how it was.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:28.450
Okay.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.850
If customers love the product, I don't care how it was tested.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.130
Let me ask you this.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.890
If customers don't love the product.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.740
Oh, customers don't love the product.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.620
It's a testing problem.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:37.860
I'm not.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.260
I'm lying.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.660
It's not because all you know what?

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.900
Because that happens from often from the same crowd.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.780
Customers don't like it.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:44.740
It must be a testing issue.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.740
It's like choose one side or the other.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.260
No, it means we built the wrong product.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.100
To me, it's quality.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.620
And I wrote a very abstract and painful to read blog posts on this topic,

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.900
so I'm not going to recommend it.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:08.740
Quality is first and foremost, how well has this thing solved my problem?

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.300
Okay.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.820
Then it's okay.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.140
Now what additional pain in the ass things does it bring to it?

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:21.820
Like it reminds me of systems theory where one of the particularly

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:27.420
systematics, there is a law in systematics which says the number of problems in the

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.860
universe is constant.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.020
So oh yeah, we talked about this like two times ago.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.740
I'll pound my.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.660
Yeah, it's essentially okay.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:34.980
Great.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.780
If it's solving my problem and if it's creating bigger problems for me,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:47.300
then then then my original problem, right without overusing the word problem,

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.140
that then becomes the problem.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:49.380
Yes.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.980
And that's where bugs and such could come into play.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.780
But if if the initial hypothesis for the purpose of the thing is wrong,

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.580
it doesn't matter if you tested it well or didn't test it at all.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.460
Right, right.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.060
I love the part where I tell you to wrap it up and you go into some big long thing.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.820
Well, that's your job.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.540
That's awesome.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.140
Okay, well, we're going to call it good here.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.660
I got a little something to play here.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.460
See what works here.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.080
All right.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.920
And we're going to leave you with that.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.800
I'm Alan.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.760
I'm Brent.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.960
Talk to you soon.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.480
Bye.
