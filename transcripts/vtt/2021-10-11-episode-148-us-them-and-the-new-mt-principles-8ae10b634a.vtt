00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.460
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980
Now, on with the show.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.390
Hey everybody.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.420
Howdy.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.420
It's Alan.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.650
Hi Alan.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:33.650
And we're here for episode 148 of the PBS Sponsor AB Testing Podcast.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.010
I'd like you to all just get out your donor cards.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.890
Now, this is the AB Testing Podcast and you never know what kind of intro you're going to

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.890
get.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.700
And I guess most of you listen past the first, most of you fast forward past this part anyway.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.140
So whatever, whatever.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.140
Episode 148.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.140
Yay.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Yay.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.860
To be clear, because I don't want lawyers contacting us later.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.780
We are not actually sponsored by PBS.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.780
We are not.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.740
We are sponsored by no one.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.780
Occasionally, occasionally we will do a sponsorship, but somebody would believe in.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.860
Although I guess we could have just hidden behind.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.580
No, no, no, not that PBS.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.980
The other PBS.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.980
Oh.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.980
Yeah.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.420
I'm so confused.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.060
So PBS is just an acronym, right?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.740
And we could have just made it up.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.740
Anyway, nevermind.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.740
Let's move forward.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.540
Hey, what's on the agenda, Alan?

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.820
Hey, I don't know.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.180
Let's figure it out as we go.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.900
We're going to do a very agile and virgin adaptive agenda that I just paid up.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.900
Yay.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.940
Yay.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.140
Let's do this.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.980
So what, let's start with what's new with you.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.100
Wouldn't it be cool if I had a theme song for like, like a segment, but this is the what's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.220
new with you segment.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.220
Yeah.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.140
We used to, when did we give it up?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140
Oh, right.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
COVID probably.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.170
Right.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.250
Cause remember we used to have sort of a made up segment on where in the world is

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.250
Oh yeah.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.770
Cause I don't go anywhere anymore.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.550
I don't, well, actually, yeah, I don't do conferences, but I have the most massively globally distributed

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.790
team right now.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.670
We just, I can talk about it now because we're going to make the announcement by the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.350
time this goes out, but we are moving another large part of unity into my org, my org.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.390
Let me see if I can remember here.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.190
Cause we have some one-offs.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:39.710
So right now my org is Sia Bellevue, of course, San Francisco, Austin, Texas, Montreal, Boston.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:47.470
I also have some remote folks in Vermont and Colorado and Denver and Pittsburgh in the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.470
US.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.910
I think that covers the US.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.150
Once we get to Europe, I have Brighton, England and a home of the ministry test.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.230
Hey everybody.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.580
And also in Edinburgh, Scotland.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.320
I need to make a map on my wall.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.820
So I remember, let me go elsewhere in Europe.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.840
Of course Helsinki, Copenhagen, as I mentioned, anybody else, I have a one-off person in Belgium.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.200
I feel like I, oh, Lithuania, Vin Vildnius.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.080
All places I haven't been in a very long time.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.680
And a few places like Lithuania have never been to.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.000
I think maybe that's it for my team.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.560
I think maybe that's it.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.320
But there may be a few other places.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.960
Anyway, that's it.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.080
Your team, I believe, well, no, I know this to be true, is larger than mine and I believe

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.880
significantly so.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880
Yeah.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.960
With this new reorg, it's about 200.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.440
So you're only one order of magnitude larger than me.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:00.430
But I have, my team of 10 is now in four distinct locations.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.270
So one bit of growing pain worth mentioning as part of that is just to a thing, because

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.150
a lot of this growth has happened in the last six months.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.540
And for the first time in my, since I've realized how important one-on-ones are, I

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.260
am now unable to do, you know, up until six months ago, I had regular one-on-ones with

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
every single person in my org.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.140
I cannot do that with 200 people, not even close.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.100
My schedule will be busy enough just meeting with the leads, the people managers across

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.380
the yard, which I find, which I will do that.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.380
Those are important.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.300
But yeah, it's a lot of peeps, a lot of things for me to learn and do.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.780
Not, I mean, you won't be able to do it at all.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.810
No, all.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.810
Because your org is pretty flat.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.530
I can't meet with everyone.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.410
I can't do skip level one-on-ones with everyone on a regular basis, but I will spot check in

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.730
and there's some people I'll meet with.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.330
I'll figure it out.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Wow.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.470
Yeah, that's, that's to me, that's meaningful.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.150
I don't know if it's good or bad.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.710
I mean, it is what it is, right?

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.710
It is.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.830
And I can do some things like some, we have a pretty, we do some things to promote transparency.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.910
We have every other week, we have a team, all hands.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.270
I just call it my team biweekly.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.670
It's all about just transparency.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.470
How decisions are being made.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.990
Just let them know what's going on.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.620
But I could also do some smaller group sort of roundtables just to have a chance to chat

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.020
with people, listen to them, see what's on their mind, take questions.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.020
There's some things I'll do.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.900
I do find a lot of value in having a personal connection with everyone in the org.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.450
It's just going to take a while with this rapid growth.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.130
Anyway, that's where, that's the org stuff.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.010
There's some other stuff that's really cool to share that I can't quite share on the podcast

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.250
yet, but wait till next week.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.410
That's the way we get listeners to come back.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.970
I will have a really cool announcement next week about modern testing.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.970
Yeah.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.690
The cliffhanger is supposed to happen at the end of the show.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.690
Good.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.690
Now you told them, yeah.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.130
We don't have a plan already mentioned it.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.130
Oh, you know what?

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.290
In the, we're in the world thing.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.530
I did agree to do a webinar coming up in January.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.780
So I have time to prepare for it with our buddies over at practice test.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.420
Oh, so I'm going to do that.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.100
I don't know what on yet, but I'm going to figure it out and we're going to figure it

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.100
out.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.300
Like we always do on this show, but not today.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.460
I do.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.460
I think that's it.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.900
Any other cool stuff?

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.100
It's getting cold out.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.100
All that stuff.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.140
I want to talk about Twitter.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.860
No, what I want to talk about.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.900
I want to get the Twitter first.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.920
For those of you that are still addicted to Facebook, it was probably nice having it gone

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.040
for a day last week.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.100
That was cool.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.210
And then not cool having it come back.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.490
Somebody wrote up, I read an article.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.190
It's in my five for Friday.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.930
Someone wrote a plugin, a Chrome plugin that deleted that unfollowed everyone by default.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.450
And I don't, I deleted my Facebook account quite a while back.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.170
Their newsfeed by people just scrolling through that doom, scrolling through Facebook and

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.890
micropayments makes billions of dollars, but it's all filled with crap.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.490
So he wrote a plugin that unfollowed everyone.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.650
So your newsfeed was blank.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.570
You could still find your, you could still go to your friend's page and see what they

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.570
posted.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.890
You just wouldn't go up in your newsfeeds.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:35.930
He just didn't have a newsfeed and Facebook not only made him delete the plugin with a

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.610
cease and desist.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:45.500
They banned him from Facebook and Instagram for life, which seems like an asshole move.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.020
Does this plugin still work?

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.300
Like can I go?

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.900
Yeah, his plugin is gone, but it still works.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.460
The zip files are available.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.860
If you know how to look for archives of things.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.600
Gotcha.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.000
So you can, you can still install it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Just have to do it manually.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.280
You can't do it from the Chrome store.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.440
And you know, some people go, oh, I need my, I need to see my, my memes telling me why

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.680
I don't need the vaccine.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.060
Well, for you folks, just, I don't want to go there.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.060
So anyway, that happened.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:23.340
And then the Twitch Twitch, uh, we're actually having an account, but I, I think I created

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.340
it when I was drunk.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.620
So it was a username and never used anywhere with a password.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.620
I didn't even know.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.120
Thank God for password managers, but did you hear what happened to Twitch?

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120
No, I did not.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120
Oh my God.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.970
Everything got dumped.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:46.010
Source code, payouts, everything as was hackers got the entire like, oh, drag, they drag and

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.010
drop everything.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:52.350
All of Twitch's internal shit onto the internet, all kinds of badness.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.510
I assume at least the passwords were hash, but yeah, bad, bad day to be a Twitch employee.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.430
And I was going somewhere with that, but I don't remember when, but I do want to talk

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.790
about Twitter now.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.790
So I said Twitter.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.230
I thought of Twitch, then it went back to Facebook, all kinds of stuff.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.310
There's this agile consultant.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.790
I follow on Twitter.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.030
His name is Alan Holub.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.630
And he is a no nonsense sort of guy.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.270
And I, a lot of this stuff is very modern testing.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.750
I don't think he, some people even bring out modern testing and replies to his tweets.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.190
I don't think he really knows what it is.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.430
And that's okay.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.070
Because again, we're not trying to sell or make a new thing that people can think about.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.150
We're just trying to find a way to describe some things that are already happening.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.510
So he had one today.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.550
No, no, two days ago, the notion of testers not being devs is odd to me.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.550
Testing must be automated.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.430
Can you see the triggers for people?

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.590
Isn't writing an automated test coding?

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.830
Somebody who can't code can't create tests at all.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.790
If they can code up a test, they can code up anything.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.030
There are no testers, just devs who understand testing.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.350
Okay.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.430
That's that stirs it up better than we do.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.830
Right?

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:06.790
Yeah.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:12.230
I mean, well, so we want to inspire a conversation.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.400
Like there's, there's nothing to what he said to me.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.320
I'll put it this way.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.760
No, uh, cause we're recording.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.120
So I can't put it that way.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:30.760
There is a element that we constantly look in terms of traditional testing that is

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.720
still holding on with white knuckles.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760
A little bit, a little bit.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.040
Yeah.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.400
I mean, there is a lot bit.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:46.070
There is a, I'll say a hype, a hyperbole, written, highly vocal element of

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.030
leadership in the traditional mentality.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.630
Alan kinda in terms of what you just read, it kind of reads like that same sort of

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.270
assertiveness on an in a modern testing site as well.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.510
Yeah.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.790
And I want to read a couple of their replies because they reek of these are

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.470
what I like about it is it reeks of modern testing without these people

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.030
knowing what modern testing is and more and more again, back at test bash me

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.030
first finished the principles.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.710
I talked about them.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.190
I was worried.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.390
People said, Oh my God, you have a name for what we're already doing.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.110
I had a feeling we just didn't know.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.310
But more and more it's happening.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.390
And unfortunately people needed to hear that to listen to our podcast.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.110
But one of the first replies on that was someone saying, I literally had this

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.670
conversation yesterday asking to replace the expected test timer in our headcount

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:40.310
estimate in a for a project team with a dev with automated test experience, which

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.590
is what I would rather hire anyway.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.710
Anyway, a bunch of, a bunch of nuggets since I found the thread like he's, I

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.950
don't read my people probably know that or I've noticed I'm not on Twitter as

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:57.310
much these days, but someone tagged me into one of into this thread somewhere,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.990
some other thread and bringing up modern testing and it's worth checking out.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:07.550
And of course, as you imagine, someone jumped in and talked about checks

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.070
and his answer, I was about to ask.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.990
And his answers, as you'd expect from anyone experienced in the industry who

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.070
didn't go, isn't part of that doctor nation.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.950
He said WTF for those that doesn't make any sense.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:20.630
Yeah.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.030
What?

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:21.750
Yeah.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.870
You're enough on that subject.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.350
I get why are the distinctions there?

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.270
I think people are using it as a weird weapon to gatekeeping.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:30.910
That's stupid.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.350
I like seeing modern testing in the wild.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.990
I didn't find his exact thread.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:42.630
I found the comment that your talks talk about, but yeah, there's a lot of,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.550
I'll just say it the last, for lack of a better word, just glancing through his

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:53.830
Twitter feed, there's a lot of, um, me too isms that are, that are rising for me.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.070
Overreliance on manual testing is the symptom of culture smell.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.390
I totally agree with that.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.270
I totally do too.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:09.270
I am part of a org where despite having dedicated Estettes, the entire org,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.110
uh, which you remember when we thought that was a good idea.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.790
At the time, I guess in the context of our ship cycle and the way we made software,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.310
it was, cause we had the test quality in, but to see it today, it just doesn't make

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.030
any sense to me.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.350
It doesn't to me.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:35.890
Orgs, this person who wrote this tweet today say that a term I haven't thought

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:43.130
of in years, like their whole org of 190 people, including a dedicated team of

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.970
Estettes will do a test bash.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.920
And I'm like, wow, it doesn't mention what industry they're in.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.720
There are certainly places where, uh, oh, it's funny.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.520
So one person came back.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.280
He's like, thanks dude.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.440
It replied to that tweet.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:01.760
Thanks.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.240
I'm now having PTSD flashbacks.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.000
Like, yeah, that that's an alignment to what I'm, to what I'm thinking of.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.200
Yeah.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.320
This guy, this guy seems in alignment.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.000
They completely agree.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.560
Yeah.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.840
But there's a lot of people.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.000
He's, he's like the meaner version of me.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.320
I'm going to read you one more.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.120
Then I want to talk about why I think this is important.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.680
This is happening.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.640
Just realize that there is a point of misunderstanding regarding testing.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.600
I am not talking about UI automation, but I talk about automated testing.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.600
Selenium is a disaster.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.040
I'm talking about tests run automatically by the CICD system run

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.280
without human intervention.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.840
And again, this is the whole me saying something like that is what got

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.480
Jason on our podcast.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.800
And I think we actually reached a weird place of agreement where.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.320
Selenium is a, it's a blessing and a curse.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.800
It works.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.880
And the reason we need to use it is because reason, not we, the

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.640
reason teams often need to use it is because one and most importantly,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.960
their application, their web app, their testing has been architected and

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.160
designed so poorly that UI automation is the only place they have to test it.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.200
The developers are working so fast and are counting on a test team to

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.040
test their stuff.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.160
So people have to use selectors from hell trademark in order to

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.560
make their goofy automation work.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.640
So the tool is fine.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.480
The work is that I, I commend Jason and everybody that's worked on web

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.800
driver to make it work over time.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.170
As I've said before, I think the no code, you, a automation tools are much

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.730
better for that because it just doesn't, I wouldn't put as much effort into that.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.970
We've rehashing stuff.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.570
I've said before, I try and say it nicely.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.450
He just gets right to the point and I kind of like it.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.570
Yeah, I, I do too.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.170
The one thing like that you were just talking about that reminded me of

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.370
systems theory, something we're fond of, right?

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.330
The, one of the problems though with systems theory is that there's actually

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:19.300
a theory within systems theory and that as you change the system to, to

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.940
actually solve a problem and then forgetting, I'm paraphrasing of course.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.180
But that the, the number of problems stays constant.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:36.100
So, so for example, I'll give you a favorite example, email, right?

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.700
When, when email first got constructed, it solved the problem of

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:48.020
communication between in or reducing the calendar time between communication

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.260
on individuals, right?

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.420
That was fantastic.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.140
But now everybody and their brother send me communication.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.700
So previously, previously it was a snail mail and the stamp was a good

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.460
filter to prevent people from trying to contact me.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:12.040
You know, certain people I don't really care to or, or right now I'm

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.480
thinking about all the slews of people that keep trying to come and

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.440
bring me more work.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.280
Email solved a problem, but then it constructed a whole new problem because

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.160
email was successful in solving the problem it was intended to solve.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:35.760
And to me, like the example that we were just talking about is related to that.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.730
I am reading one of his tweets now.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.690
I'm, I'm gonna change the topic.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:41.930
The, well, kinda.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.130
Well, I have, I have a tangential topic after this as well, but you can, go ahead.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.450
Good.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.490
Did you do you.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.730
So here's a question I'm thinking of it that he asked.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:56.810
He asked the question, is there an adjective to put in front of the word test

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:02.690
that describes all testing except exploratory and usability testing?

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.970
And I'm guessing he's in response to like the.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:06.930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.090
You know, what's going on there.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.010
So yeah, the word test evidently doesn't mean test anymore.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:17.930
Well, it, unfortunately it doesn't in a, in a small part of the community and whatever,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.570
but my big realization, I followed him for a while, but just as these threads of

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:27.530
the last couple of days, like, Oh my God, he is, he is modern testing incarnate.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.130
And he doesn't know anything about modern testing, which is great.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.730
Which again, gets me to the fact that if, and when I'm doing, of course,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.210
I'm doing a webinar for practice test.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.810
I'm trying to figure out the right way to talk about modern testing

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.250
with a non testing audience.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.160
Example, he speaks of some arc, a lot of architecture conferences, but I'm

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.760
going to architecture conference or a, uh, DevOps conference or an

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.560
infrastructure conference, pardon me.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.630
Thinks it like there'll be such does like, why'd you put a name on something?

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.110
We already know if we talk about modern testing, that it would

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.650
be the wrong topic, that maybe it's an aside.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.330
I'm just trying to figure out how to.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:19.170
When I read his tweets and see tweets like this, what I think is, and what

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.330
I always think it's not like I want to have 10,000 listeners for the podcast,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.530
but I think there are people that do not know about our podcasts.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.170
I could listen to it.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.850
So let's do this.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.810
I don't know the answer listeners do this talk about the podcast with

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.290
people who aren't testers and see what they think, see if they want to check

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.930
it out, give us reviews and blah, blah, blah.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:43.650
Uh, that's, that's the sort of thing I'm realizing that with modern testing,

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.230
that there's just more and more things that are happening that are modern

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.910
testing without knowing about modern testing, which is really, really cool.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.670
And I want to see more of that.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.710
Oh, I love this guy.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.910
Right.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.630
So there, he has a tweet a while back where he takes a nice dig on safe.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.790
So, uh, just, just keep that in mind too.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.870
So they will, we'll talk about that in a future episode.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.110
And I just tweaked my cable.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.710
Yeah.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.070
I was leaning back and my camera cable.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.190
This should have been a YouTube broadcast, but oh well.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.670
Yeah.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.190
So tell me what you think of this phrase.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:26.510
He says, knowing already upfront manual testing for final released is usually

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.830
a band aid over bad architecture.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.690
I have yet to see a situation where people claim that manual testing was

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:39.290
indispensable where you couldn't change the architect to support automated

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.250
testing inside the CI CD pipeline.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.150
So going back to your other things, going back to your last thing, you

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:52.550
know, how would you, how would you, how would you reach the, the dev

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.790
audience with this modern testing console?

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.790
What I'm trying to decide is whether they need, you know what the devs that

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.870
need to hear this or not this guy, it's the devs that think they need

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.110
a test team in order to deliver.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.660
It's the developers who do not think they have the knowledge or the

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.580
permission to test their product.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.180
Yeah.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:21.070
I'm, I'm remembering back to the episode we did several years ago.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.010
Oh yeah.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.250
Good old episode 30, 70 something.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.240
Are you being snarky or do you actually know totally snarky.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.040
All right.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.240
The one at Evans company.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.200
Oh, at redfin.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.040
Yeah.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.520
Thank you.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.240
Uh, I knew it was red something, but I kept on going.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.400
You'd be testing live from the redfin auditorium.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.160
Right.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.820
And for some reason, my head couldn't let go that the name of the

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.700
company was red Zillow, even though I knew like there's no company called red

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.220
Zillow.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:53.980
Okay.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.780
There is revzilla who sells motorcycle equipment, but anyway, go on redfin.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.300
Right.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:05.280
Evan, the audience, the audience, the audience you would need to reach

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.880
is exactly that it.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.360
And we like, that was that company at that time, they had separate Dev and

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.800
tests and what we wanted to do was speak to the Dev because, and I actually, I

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.760
think that's a really smart idea.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:26.720
Cause if there is a way that we could reach that crowd and convert them.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:33.540
Cause a lot of the times we hear that a lot of that a lot, like modern testing

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.100
resonates with a lot of testers, right?

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.460
A lot of them.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:47.380
The reality is most from my experience, most test teams as an organization is,

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.740
is low man on the discipline pole.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.870
Yeah.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.990
Right.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:56.150
It, they, they, they often do not have, it's not entirely the case, but they

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.590
often do not have the political clout to initiate change.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.900
Dev is at the top of it.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.740
How do you influence those folks?

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.290
I've come up with a lot of techniques as have you around basically

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.450
forcing functions to do this.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:20.170
But my techniques have, have relied on me knowing full well, what power I have.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.850
For example, I know I own that.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.490
I own the resource allocation of the people on my team.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.530
All right.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.970
You don't want to play ball with modern testing.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.530
Guess who just, who just lost all of their testers.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:36.610
Right.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.730
So let me, I have a, I have a thought exercise.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.130
It's going to take a little bit of time here.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.170
There's a good segue here.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:50.210
So when we wrote the modern testing principles and honestly, it's still

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.770
kind of blows me away that one.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.890
I was inspired to do so in the first place to make the draft in the first place,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.130
but how little they've changed.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:05.610
We thought maybe we'd modify more, but also how often they're referred to.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.290
But we wrote them for testers.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.970
The audience of the modern testing principles were testers.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:12.610
Yep.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.530
And I want to look at these one by one.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.560
And I'm curious if there's a rewording we would do for developers.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.560
So for number one, I think it stays the same.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.720
Our priority is improving the business.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.270
Yes.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:27.950
That's good.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:28.870
That's good for anyone.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.070
That's not tester centric.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:36.590
The next one is we accelerate the team and use models, blah, blah, blah,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.550
to identify our prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks in the system.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.630
Who's we in this case?

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:46.370
Is it everyone who's who's the we in that sentence?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.330
We were when we wrote it, we were targeting testers.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.250
That's what I just said.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:53.650
Yes.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.410
But as written, does it, does it target the whole team now?

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.970
Or would we tweak?

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.450
We're not saying we're going to change these, but it will be tweak.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:03.890
Where is this?

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.370
If these were for developers?

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:06.370
Yeah.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:11.050
So, so I put my, my old dev hat on.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.420
Right.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:19.100
And, and then that was like my, my, what I drew from to help craft these.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:19.940
Right.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:25.340
And I would say, oh yeah, that's exactly what we did.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.140
Yeah.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:32.620
My, my team did that accelerate in principle to came from accelerate the

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.260
shipment of the really simple quality, right?

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.380
Achievement of quality.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:42.660
So I wonder if I'm not going to try and get these perfect, but if we just

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.500
said we use models like lean thinking, blah, blah, blah, then that can

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.860
become the whole team a little easier.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:48.780
Let me look at them.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.620
No, no, but, but that statement, that statement is true.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.100
Period.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.860
Whole team dev test PM that that team, maybe you're right.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.940
I think let me look at the next one.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:01.940
I think you're right.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.100
We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.460
optimize in order to succeed.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.500
This one's a little interesting.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.540
There's a we, then there's helping the team.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.620
So we are helping the team.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.050
So if the team is we that reads weird.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.970
Well, maybe because I don't think it's a separation.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:27.650
I think, no, I think what if we change the, to our, we're a force for continuous

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.490
improvement, helping our team adapt and optimize order to succeed rather than

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.130
providing a safety net to catch pillars.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.010
Again, that clause at the end, that's about testers.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.290
Yes.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:44.090
So if we said something like we are a force for continuous improvement, helping

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:50.330
the helping our team adapt and optimize in order to succeed rather than relying

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.210
on safety notes to catch features.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.230
Uh, I would even say even more proactively something along the lines

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.980
of actively removing safety nets.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.340
Oh yeah.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.940
And right now people are freaking out.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.340
Don't change the principles.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.420
And we're not going to right away, but there's something I thought about

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.940
for a while to dove tails in here.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.180
I want it to be, I'm going to be like, I've gone on these adventures with

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.940
Alan in the past, just be absolutely clear.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.740
We are on path to change the principles.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.460
This is, it's an unavoidable path.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.580
It is going to happen.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.780
I cannot tell you when, but the three will speak.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.380
And I got to say, if you're on my team listening to this, this is the way I do

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.940
things I, I don't dictate change.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.780
I put the wheels in motion for change to happen.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.500
And I'll do that a lot.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.540
I don't like, I don't make very many decisions for my team has a discussion

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.700
before, but I make sure we have the right discussion so they figure out

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.700
what change needs to happen.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:57.900
So, okay.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.460
So let me tell you putting my dev head on reading and rereading this again.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.180
Like previously I was, I was doing modern test manager versus traditional

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.660
test manager when we did this.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.340
Yes, of course.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:17.340
Now putting on, you know, manager of a dev team where I did not have a test

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.860
team that was successful.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.420
What did we do?

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:21.580
Right.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:30.500
And this one was about number one, the lean principle known as optimize the whole.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:30.780
Yes.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.620
In other words, you don't try to optimize what does it take to get to, to

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.420
co-complete and then what is it?

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.540
What does it take to get the test complete?

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:47.300
You optimize the whole system in that, which is how do we release this whole

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.980
thing in the end, the fastest?

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.740
Cause that that's what, that's how you get the trade-off discussions between things.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.140
Yeah.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:00.380
So the safety net is to catch failures, right?

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.460
This is the old school mentality around everything must be that if you're not

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.340
trying to prevent things, you're doing things wrong.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.180
Right.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.760
As a lot of the times, as we've discussed, CICD or, uh,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:21.460
flighting systems with, uh, an appropriate, uh, flight controller that evaluates

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.860
risk before going out more and more broadly, these are actually better

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.100
systems that to help you avoid waste.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.380
Now I'm looking at, so when I look at this, the other thing I see that's

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:43.420
in this is, is an element of learning slash scaling.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.940
If there's a focus on the end goal KPIs, not the intermediary ones,

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.100
that's what we're trying to improve.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.140
And then there's a focus on helping the whole team learn what

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.140
the whole team needs to learn.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.100
Right.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.410
So to me, it also kind of kills siloism.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.010
Yeah.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:08.650
As written, there's a little bit of us and them in the principles,

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.570
which I don't think is the right thing for the long-term.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:17.410
I want to read the next one to you in the new form in a potential.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.530
There's a draft.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:26.010
We care deeply about the quality culture of our team and we coach lead

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.010
and nurture each other towards a more mature quality culture.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.460
I replaced the team with each other.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.340
No, I like, I like that algorithm already.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:43.350
Cause again, that's around, there's two aspects of that now.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:49.540
It's around, I don't know if you, if I've ever walked you through

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.340
when I'm doing a kickoff for agile, right?

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.220
When I'm, when a team's asked me to come and teach them agile,

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.100
it hasn't happened in years.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:04.380
But one of the things I describe is actually agile is a team sport.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.020
It's closer to soccer.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.080
Galah though.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:10.840
Right.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:16.180
It's closer to soccer in my mind than it is rugby.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.200
Right.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.400
In, in soccer.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.960
And I think I've told you this, I don't know about this.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.120
Yeah.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.920
I'm, I'm huge on the whole soccer strategy thing.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.800
We've talked about this.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.040
Yeah.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.600
Well, but not on air, maybe go ahead.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.160
Yeah.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:34.360
I'll just say years ago, I had an employee that was in a, a

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.160
competitive corporate league.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.000
Okay.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.560
And they got to play at what was then called Century Link field.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.840
And it's now called Loomin field.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:44.640
Yeah.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.480
It's Seahawks stadium, whatever.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.640
Um, Loomin field sounders play there too.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.600
Anyway, go on.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:57.380
Um, it was interesting cause that was the first time I had ever been in

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.580
the been in that stadium where you get actually here.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.170
Oh yeah.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:04.450
Yeah.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.490
Okay.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:12.290
And I could hear the chatter on the field and what I really walked away with.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:18.810
And I paid attention to this even like when I watch TV games, I'm like, okay,

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.810
are they, can I tell that the players are talking?

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:23.010
Answers?

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:23.770
Yes.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:24.610
Yes.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:30.180
And in the soccer, the teams are very clear on the goals.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.300
And when they need to be defensive, they all shift to defense.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:40.340
When they, when they have an advantage and they can get to the goal on

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:46.900
appropriate number, you know, shifted towards offense while still doing

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.900
risk mitigation, like I could look at a soccer game and watch the game and

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.660
describe it in terms of software development.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:54.940
Sure.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.300
Sure.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.960
And actually I would say, I mean, one thing is very true is a

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.590
soccer team is made up of a group of specializing generalists or

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.790
generalizing specialists.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.590
Yes.

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.750
They have some things they're good at and people are put in a position

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.510
where they can be most effective, but some players, there are some

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.670
utility players on every team in the world who can play multiple

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:19.310
positions.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.470
Well, it's about knowing the role you're supposed to play and applying

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.470
the skills you have towards the success of that role.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.510
The other parallel I like in this is if you watch, I've played a

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.990
goalkeeper quite a bit, even though I'm not very tall and old, but

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.310
one thing I like about that is you see everything in front of you and

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.230
you do, you do a lot of directing.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.990
You do a lot of eyes for everybody.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.070
And that's where a lot of the defensive communication starts.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.870
Yeah.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:56.070
Uh, the, the, the thing I found just most notable is how audible

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:01.870
the team players were when I was younger, you know, whatever it

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:06.110
was fifth grade or whatever played soccer in a league, like there

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.030
wasn't anywhere like this type of talking.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:15.430
Whereas at that level, the teams are covering each other.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.530
They, they say they know exactly when to hand off.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:23.650
They tell they, they are looking out for each other when they're

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:24.410
under threat.

00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:27.290
Like, you know, someone is coming up from behind and about to

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.490
try to take the ball.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:29.370
Right.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:37.570
That is what I see, what I think about when I read your, or when

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.530
I think about your replacement for principal four, the only thing

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:46.570
I'm thinking about though, is when we go and talk to a dev team,

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.130
is quality the right term?

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.220
I think so.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:56.500
It's, I only, I can't think of a better one.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.260
I think of, you know, this is all around the quality

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.340
cultural transition guide.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.420
The, so the one, I can't, I don't think of a better word there.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.140
Well, if I were to, we deeply care about the culture of our team.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:17.420
We care, lead and mature each other towards a mature culture.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:23.060
Now, the way I just said it, I'm sure you have no doubt will

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.180
agree with it.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.620
The difference between the two is whether or not it's important.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.380
Cause if you remove, if you remove quality, then you're kind of

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.620
talking about how well people work together.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.700
Let me, let me phrase it differently and see it and totally

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.620
change the meaning.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:47.300
We care deeply about the quality of our product and we coach lead

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.190
and nurture each other towards a more mature culture.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.690
That doesn't make sense that way.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:59.290
Do we focus on the quality product or the quality of the way we make it?

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.870
What is as written originally, it's about the way we make it with an,

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.150
assuming that I'll get to an output that's high quality.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:12.310
No, I like how you, I like, I like where you're going with that rephrasing,

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.630
but if we were to do that, then I would want to swap principle four and five.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.510
Okay.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.070
Uh, I want to move on cause we're going to talk a lot about seven, five

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.430
and six ship them as is.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.430
We believe the customer is the only one capable of judging, evaluate

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.350
the quality of our product.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.510
That's actually perfect already as much as it pisses people off who are,

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.510
they don't get it.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:37.030
And number six, we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.950
And then close the gaps between product hypothesis and business impact,

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.990
ship it as is no need for a change.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:48.150
And then the next one is definitely a we, us, and them thing that I

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.350
can have to think here for a minute on how to, how we rephrase this.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:57.150
We expand testing abilities and know how across the team, understanding

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.950
that this may reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.310
This one's all for, we wrote it for the testers.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.340
What would this, how would we rephrase this written

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.780
for a more generic team audience?

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:16.740
Well, so, uh, cause this is all, what does it say in a nutshell is that

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.500
everyone knows how to test and gets, it gets better at it all the time.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.210
What is your, give a shit about testing.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:28.020
What is your simple, cause I know we had different versions.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:35.700
Uh, you, what is your like two or three word, um,

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.740
encapsulation of principle seven.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.120
Do you remember what I'm talking about?

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.040
Everybody tasks.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.090
Every, okay.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:43.810
That doesn't work.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.530
Sorry, man.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.170
And so, so, okay.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:57.740
Number one, we can fix the first part of, of this by just getting rid of the word

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.940
testing, is this really just without the word testing in there?

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.460
Is that, is it about being a learning organization?

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.040
This is yeah.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.480
How about we expand abilities and know how across the team,

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:16.760
understand this may reduce or eliminate the need for specialists.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.250
For, for a dedicated specialist.

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:23.030
That may work.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.100
Yeah.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:29.530
That was much, much easier than I thought it would be.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.490
The wheels are spinning.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:34.770
And again, the audience going, no change the principles, but, uh, yeah,

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.530
it's worth talking about.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.010
And I think, well, so that, what do we call it?

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.930
I don't know.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.090
The podcast.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.050
Pretty soon.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:51.770
It's like, I don't know what's going on, but I, yeah, I didn't know we were going

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.330
to talk about this till we started, but it's something that I've been thinking

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:59.610
about subconsciously, apparently for a while and cause I can tell just by

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:02.650
talking through it, I go, Oh, now it's these words.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:06.490
Like, how do we get to more of the people that need to hear us?

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.450
And we've preached to testers for a long time, but having the

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:13.370
realization that we need to, I would like to find a way to get this

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:17.050
information in front of the developers that know that they get, if I said

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:22.250
before, it's not just telling developers, they have to test often that approach.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.380
They just get mad and say, I need to test.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:30.460
I don't want to test, but what I've learned more and more is again,

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.500
this is extrapolated and I'll get to my point.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.540
It's extrapolated by the exact aspirated.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:34.900
Sorry.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.940
By the fact that people still insist that testing is a very special thing

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.500
that only specialists can do.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:48.570
And to be clear, some, there is room for, anyway, I'm not going to go on the tangent.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:49.210
No.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:55.000
And, and, and we talked about it here and I, yeah, I think, I think it was,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:01.000
it was my second to last blog post where, where I talk about essentially

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:08.280
except in a very rare situation, I'm now the view that specialization

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.040
does not make sense in software development.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.240
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.840
And the point that I failed to get to, that's all my fault, not yours.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.800
So I'll take, I'll take the blame on that one is that we just need to tell

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:25.390
developers they need to give, we need to give them permission to test and tell

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.510
them that they can actually do it.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.750
That's something that's within their realm.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:33.950
They've been told for so long that we need testing specialists to do testing.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:39.190
And we've created that codependency that it's those folks that feel like that,

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:45.790
that I think need to see this potentially up and coming slight revision of the

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.110
modern testing principles.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.430
Let me, we have a few minutes.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.670
Yeah.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.630
And I have one other quick story to share at the end about a podcast I listened

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.710
to today, but so go ahead and go on and do your few minute thing.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.670
Okay.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:05.110
So I am now going to share with you the safe principles.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.500
Oh God.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:07.660
Yeah.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.780
Be prepared.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:14.140
Oh, these are actually similar and they're shaped.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:19.300
Look at, yeah, I think it's kind of nerdy that they did that.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.120
But number one, take an economic view.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.840
Uh, our priority is the business.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.160
Cool.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:27.520
Got it.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:27.920
Yep.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.440
Number two, apply systems thinking.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:31.760
Yeah.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.080
I've, I've heard of that one before.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:35.210
Okay.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.850
Now, Hey, when did these come out?

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:37.930
Did they steal our shit?

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.070
The article, I don't know.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.430
Okay.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.870
Anyway.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:42.630
Yeah.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:49.550
They obviously have more assume variability preserve options.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.470
That's an agile thing that we didn't cover, but yeah.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.710
Okay.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:52.470
I'm going to go with that.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.950
Build incrementally with fast integrated learning cycles.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.710
All right.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.540
Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:03.860
Okay.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:08.500
Whatever I would, I would, I would nix that one, but whatever I would have so far,

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:13.420
I would probably cut number three and number five, the two that don't match up

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.780
to empty principal school, gotcha.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.220
Go on.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.260
Well, yeah.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.380
Although I think this one, I don't think we covered number six, visualize

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.060
and limit with reduced, reduced batch sizes and manage queue links.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:26.300
Yeah.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.860
But our intention was that, and I totally agree with, I don't disagree with that at

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.300
all, but our intention was not to talk about the basics of agile.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.980
So it's more of the approach, but yeah, I get, I get why it's there.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:42.220
I think we, I think we've collapsed that like in the principle.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.460
What is it to this?

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.220
There is a construct on that.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:45.500
Right.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:46.180
Right.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.380
Apply cadence and synchronized with cross-domain planning.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.860
Um, that cut.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.680
That would be cut.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.640
It's important to be cut.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.160
Okay.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.040
Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.240
Oh my God.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.160
Do I love that one?

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:09.040
And we, we have things that touch on it, but not exactly what that is saying.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.410
Decentralized decision-making, right?

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.890
We don't, we don't even touch that.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:14.210
Right.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.930
And then organize around value.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:24.200
Now I'll tell you, organize around value is, is it specifically talking

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:31.060
around literally a reorganization, uh, but having gone through it, I will tell

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:37.420
you that that principle is starting off with principle five, it's starting off

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.220
with principle five and going even further saying you should also

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.700
organize your teams around that.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:44.060
Yeah.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:44.460
Okay.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.100
Tell your story.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:45.460
Okay.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:45.940
Quick story.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.580
And then when I got to go out of time here, actually I got two minutes.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:53.980
So I was listening to the knowledge project podcast and this time it's

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.580
Walter Isaacson who's written a bunch of stuff.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:04.670
He's super, super smart, but he was talking about Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.230
started using this word impute.

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:08.830
You know what impute means?

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:09.870
Of course I do.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:10.750
I'm a data scientist.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:11.350
Okay.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:18.030
He started using it a lot and he wanted like the reason when the iPod first

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.110
came out, it had, it wasn't just the iPod.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.590
That was this thing you wanted in your dreams.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:26.990
It was the packaging and Apple products, even going back to the max.

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:28.190
I just got a new Mac a while back.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.950
They spent a lot of time in their packaging and money on the packaging

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:36.630
because they want to impute on you that this whole thing is high quality

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.190
awesomeness and he talked about a couple of other examples and he goes,

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.910
and he says, and then when you look at something like Microsoft Teams,

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:50.110
they also impute and they impute that you want a horrible user experience

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.230
where you can't figure out how to do anything.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.390
And it just cracked me up.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:58.230
He totally in his eloquent way, just totally dug on teams.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.390
So I thought that was, thought that was just fun.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.230
I like a little bashes on, on the old team.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.550
Okay.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:06.830
So that was my little story there.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:11.030

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.870
We have about 750 members of the three there right now.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:19.830
Maybe a few more.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.510
I tell your friends about the podcast.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.670
You can find me on Twitter at Alan Page.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.710
