WEBVTT

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:27.310
Hey everybody. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And it's episode 51. 51. 51 of A B testing. Thanks everyone

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.830
for downloading yet another podcast. It's our end of the year episode. It is. It is. You know what?

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.220
Now at this point, maybe hasn't passed. I was going to say at this point, we've done more episodes

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.180
than the oldest of A B testing. I turned 51 a few weeks ago. It's a tie. And now we're in episode

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.570
51. If we survive the holidays, we'll do 52. And then, uh, yeah, what are you doing for the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.570
holidays, Brent? You staying in town? You going to Las Vegas? No, staying in town. And, and, um,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.530
I'm doing what is an accidental tradition, which is at the start of December, I go, Hey, I take,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.250
I'm going to take the last two weeks off. That's enough to do my shopping. And then when the last

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.930
two weeks come, I go, Oh crap. The last two weeks only gives me one week till Christmas.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:25.570
Why don't I learn this year over year? So I will be fighting traffic. Oh, wait, it's Christmas.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.800
It is. Shoot. I have to do some shopping too. I'm in trouble. That's what Amazon's for. Thank you,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.510
Amazon. Yeah. The only problem with Amazon is it doesn't tell you what to buy. You still have

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.910
to look for it. Yeah. We're down a rabbit hole. I don't want to be down because this is a,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.100
it's hard. It is hard. I was going to say something funny and clever and interesting

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.500
and relevant. And now I've completely forgotten it. I will say that the big value adds to society

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.580
for those data scientist guys would be to solve that problem. Pretty soon. Can't we do that? Can't

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.410
we just plug in a name to a search engine? It tells us what they need or what they'd like,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.890
even better, not what they think they want, but based on their analysis of social media,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.700
research, postings, whatever their internet presence, it tells you what they want that

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.700
they don't know they want. Right. And prune out the risks of things like, Hey,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.550
my wife says she wants a vacuum cleaner, but does she really know, dude, save the vacuum cleaner

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.650
for Valentine's day. Is that better? Is that really better? Yeah. Do the vacuum cleaner. Here's a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:52.910
romantic vacuum cleaner, honey. Get her a red one. Oh yeah. Sure. Come on. There you go. Perfume it up.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.540
Yeah. Yeah. Present it in candlelight. Yeah. Yeah. I got you a vacuum cleaner. Yeah, baby.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.500
I'm, I'm driving to Bozeman, Montana. I'm sorry. Yeah. I, do you think of a better month to drive

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.180
over the Rocky mountains in December? No. Yeah. Yeah. You got to go through 90. So like you're just.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.020
It's 90 all the way. You got two sets of chains in case one breaks.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.340
Just, just one set of overpriced Tesla chains. You're driving your Tesla through the snow.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.860
Heck yeah. All right. Way to go. The thing, the thing I, I remember is, uh,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.300
I 90 is a huge trucker route. It's driven on all the time. So even if there's snow,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.020
it gets kind of beaten down pretty quickly. You should double check. Cause I did hear in

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.500
the news that they were going to shut down 90 sometime around now ish.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.580
It can't shut it down. It's a major thoroughfare. Yeah. But they were doing some avalanche. Yeah.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.420
They close it like, yeah. So they don't shut it down. I'm not leaving now.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.360
They're moving a mile an hour. Just look, just saying, or don't, you know,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.940
it'd be a great story for next year's podcast. Yeah. Yeah. If I live, jeez. Hey,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.060
it's the last podcast of 2016. Yep. And we should talk about some of our favorite things.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.310
Here's where I'll cue the, we really need.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:32.510
Yeah. So our favorite things from 2016 and maybe some things we'll predict from 2017

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.950
and we can reflect on our predictions from 2016 and whatever else comes to mind as we

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.310
babble through the next 40 minutes or so. Right. Hey, so the first thing, uh,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.600
it is episode 51. We, uh,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.320
I always worry when Brent starts reading his phone during the podcast.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:06.160
Yeah. I can write it down here. So last time we did this last year was somewhere around episode 30 ish.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.560
30. Oh, I mailed it to you. It's like 36.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.860
36, 30, 30. Yeah. You can go. I'll, I always say I'll link to things in the show notes,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.020
but I probably won't, but I will try and remember to add a link to last year's prediction episode,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.580
because I'm going to quote from it. I'm going to paraphrase from it loosely later.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:31.520
Yes. So what's your prediction for the episode number for this episode next year?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.160
Oh, that's a good one. So our prediction show for next year will be,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.040
oh, there's some factors in here. I have to talk to you about after the show.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.320
Let's say 72. 72. I'm going to say 70. So it'll be real close.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.300
All right. This is like the prices, right? Where you, as close as we can go over, right?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.900
So if it's 71, we tie and we hug. Otherwise, yeah, if we want to,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.020
want to do it that way, it's the closest without going over.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.860
And if it's going to be episode 70, I will break one podcast into like three.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.810
I have the power to control my own. You forget I can be clever occasionally.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.450
Yeah. Hawthorne's effect in effect.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.010
This is not even the Hawthorne effect. This is just me being a dick.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.730
Yeah. It's people's behavior changed in accordance to how it's being measured.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.730
You want to win. So you're going to change the behavior.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.690
And you're like, ha ha ha. I have power. Brent doesn't.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.200
It's because I'm a winner. Winning that meme is like five years old.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.880
So done. Yeah.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.000
So old. Okay. What have been some of your favorite moments for 2016 that you recall?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And keep in mind that both Brent and I are old and we can't remember what we did last week.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.840
So remembering podcast moments may be difficult.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.720
The positive thing is I took notes. Oh my god.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.030
The one episode a year, I know upfront I will have the Hawthorne.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.590
I however am completely unprepared.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:15.500
I have three I wrote down. So first and foremost, my absolute favorite moment of 2016

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.470
was our first promo code.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.010
You mean our sponsor from Star?

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.650
Yeah.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.330
Hey, I would like to take this point to let Brent know and our listeners know that

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.290
they enjoyed our little plug so much. Star would like us to be like a regular,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.410
like once a quarter sponsor for 2017. We have made it.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.410
We have made it. We have like,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.010
we haven't totally made it. Like aren't we supposed to get paid for this?

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.370
Working that out. But at the very least we may get a very huge

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.530
free Star logo to put on the hood of your car.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.250
Nice. Swag.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:08.540
Yeah. AB Podcasting where the sponsorship is super friction free. I don't know. I have to work on the

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.200
Yeah. You keep thinking about that.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.400
So anyway, yes, we had our first sponsor.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.680
So they circled back. So the people actually use the promo code?

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.920
I don't know. That's interesting. I didn't ask.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.120
But they did. I don't know if anybody did or not.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.000
Because we only have three listeners. I don't know that any of them went to Star.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.940
However, they think we're mildly interesting and we don't rag on Star too much.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.300
So they're going to have us back. So congratulations, Brent.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.100
That's awesome.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.860
You're like a professional podcaster.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.300
Almost like one.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.980
At a very loose definition of professional.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.020
And podcaster.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.180
Yeah.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.410
True, true, true, true.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.410
Hey, hear that, Vernon?

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.090
Test Bash.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.290
Vernon. Test Bash.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.070
Promo code.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:06.270
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we can we can sponsor Test Bash, but they're pretty low.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.670
They're such a different beast than Star.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.150
Yeah.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.430
I'm star is like this corporate enterprise marketing machine.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.830
So you get it's a great place to get as we mentioned before.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.870
This one, not even any sponsorship.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.070
I think stars where you go and you want a bunch. I'm new to this.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.790
I need a bunch of knowledge and ideas, etc, etc.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.210
And then just bash where you go. It's like more in the masterclass.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.050
Sure. Really, at the end of the day, I just want more promo codes.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.370
All right, man. We'll get that done.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.530
Low, low hanging bar there.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.810
My boss is texting me, so I just got to you talk for a minute.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.170
I'm just going to let him know.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:47.650
Oh, OK.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:57.100
My second favorite podcast moment was the spontaneous

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.740
invention of the one of the three slack channel from one of the three.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.340
That's right. That's a good moment worth remembering.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.180
It was better at this than me, Brent.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.880
It helps to remember when you've already thought about it and wrote it down.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.080
Yeah, whatever.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.160
You have a slack team and it's kind of fun.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.880
I really am enjoying the conversations there.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.360
Yeah.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.840
It's like hanging out backstage with Alan and Brent.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.320
If Alan and Brent, it really is.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.520
If Alan and Brent don't actually participate as much, but Brent does.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.400
There's a lot of great conversation among the three without us.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.840
Alan's, I would classify you sort of as a slack channel stalker.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:44.580
You get involved if someone's mocking you or usually me.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.380
Or someone says something that you just can't stand anymore.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.460
I imagine that's how you handle Twitter.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.580
That's usually you also.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.230
But yeah, the slack channel, if you're not on it,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.190
you should get on it.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.190
It's really formed up an informal community.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.940
Yeah, it's one of the three.slack.com.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.780
If you need an invitation, you can email me, Alan at angryweasel.com.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.500
Oh, we're gonna...

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:12.940
Okay.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.420
You can do that.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.220
How else are you gonna do it?

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.740
I just like Hawk and Percy like crazy on that one.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.450
Percy has done a lot for us.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.970
Maybe in the spirit of the holidays,

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.450
you shouldn't chuck more crap on top of him.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.210
Is he your lackey?

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.060
I think he likes it.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:39.700
Did you hear episode 49, how happy he was saying, and I'm not Brent.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.980
That was 48, right?

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.450
49?

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.410
48, yes.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.650
Anyway, that was my high point of the year,

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.410
recording that episode with the guys at Test Bash.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.210
That was a lot of fun.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.130
Yeah, I wish I had been there.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.530
I've not been to Philadelphia, so it would have been fun doing the historical tour.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.720
And then from...

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:05.040
I really enjoyed the series we did on transforming the data cultures,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.560
starting in episode 44.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.040
I have...

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.240
Bringing in Steve Rose.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.800
I have myself stolen so much information from those discussions on my team.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.200
Oh, good.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.960
So that was a good learning experience for me.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.800
Have you tried like, hey, here's this awesome podcast.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.520
UPM should listen to it.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.040
These guys, they know their stuff.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.000
Have you tried that angle yet?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.040
No, I haven't tried that.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.120
Wow.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.880
You think you get away with that?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.880
Well, Microsoft has this huge value and huge push around the growth mindset.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.600
Yep.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.200
Which is from the book.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.720
It's called Mindset, yeah.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.360
You can look it up.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.560
I don't need to talk about it.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.680
Most of our PMs don't have that.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.280
I hope they don't listen to the podcast now.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.560
Yeah, so I'm guessing you're not going to use this as a reference to them.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.080
No, no.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.680
But I think the point is, I think I can safely say that and not edit it out.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.840
That's the fun part.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.960
Oh my gosh.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.540
Alan's getting the love from the management.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.020
Yeah, and my boss is in India right now, where it is only about nine,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.260
a little after nine o'clock at night.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.180
Yeah, most bosses I'm aware of still aren't in.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.940
I was feeling bad for you.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.780
Like 24 seven, he's got his eyes on you.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.820
That was, was 48 your highlight?

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.460
It was episode 44 is where it began.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.820
I think we did three or four episodes.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.180
I'm sorry, 48 was, I meant it was 48 the highlight of having AB testing without Brent.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.340
No, that made me sad.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.700
Like really between the two of us, you've done 51 episodes and I've done 50.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.900
And I'm not entirely certain since you have all the equipment, how I catch up.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.460
Maybe I record a conversation on the phone.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.580
Tell you what, you can just talk into a tape recorder

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.740
and then figure out how to upload that to the internet.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.010
Yeah.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.280
Again, not catching up.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.480
All right.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.820
You have any of your own moments?

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.180
49 was my favorite.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.780
Sorry, 48 was my favorite.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.460
You screwed me up by calling it 49.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.670
Try bring games or something, pick up your memory agility.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.790
I'm sorry, what were we talking about?

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.950
Yeah.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.070
So you liked going to Philly and recording with the one of the three?

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:19.790
That was a lot of fun.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.430
Anything else comes to mind?

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:28.030
Uh, was it this year with the episode where I asked you the ISTQB questions?

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.910
No, that was last year.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.390
Damn it.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.910
That was our favorite moment from, that was one of our favorite moments.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:33.790
I can't remember.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.270
Yeah.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.150
I really, this will be the year 2017.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.710
Yeah, right.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.630
As I get older will be the year where I really break things down.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.830
We need, you know, um, the Stack Overflow podcast,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.590
they have people that translate, that translate the text,

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.230
not only into English, but into different languages.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.110
We need one of those.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.070
I didn't like someone Stack Overflow had a podcast.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:55.790
See, that's what you know.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.900
So, uh, let's flip those two speaking of podcasts.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.140
Um, I was thinking about my favorite pot, the podcast I listened to the most

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.420
ones I listened to the most in the last year and they haven't really changed.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:17.020
So I, so for me, freaking omics, although, um, because of your suggestions last year,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.380
I listened to a great deal of the ones that you suggested last year.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.860
For example, uh, I don't remember what I was forgetting.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.620
Then actually I have my phone.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.540
So I'll tell you why you look it up.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:35.260
So my, the staples that I listened to regularly, I'm sort of a trivia nerd.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.020
I just saw a good job brain.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.660
Yep.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.060
So good job brain is something I listened to.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.100
I listened to both.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.380
Wait, wait, don't tell me.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.500
And, uh, what's the other trivia?

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.620
A little bit lamer trivia show on NPR.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.100
I don't know.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.300
Uh, I don't have it.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.630
It is a shoot has a fear of Eisenberg crap.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.660
It'll come back to me.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.100
So I still actively listened to this American life.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.420
I, I like the story model.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.780
It's a great way to learn.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:12.220
I mean, the way to learn anything is to immerse yourself in the technique.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.920
For example, when I was in college and played in a jazz bands, we'd have this grueling

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.800
audition process.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.360
And a lot of times he'd ask like, who do you listen to?

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.660
It's what there's so much more of what you get as like a jazz musician on what you

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.380
listen to.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.620
And there's so much you learn by listening to players play the good, the great players

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.940
that will eventually transition into your playing.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.940
All the great writers say the way you get better at writing is to practice writing a

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.220
lot and to read a lot.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.900
Stephen King has a great book called on writing.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.780
He talks about just if you want to be a good writer, you need to read a lot.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.580
If you want to be a good storyteller, listen to a lot of good stories and read a lot

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.620
of good stories.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.100
Yeah.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.540
And, and learn the art of a, sounds like a James Whitaker talk, learn the art of

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.260
storytelling.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.540
Years ago, there was a class here at Microsoft advanced presentation design.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:09.740
And that was a key aspect of the whole thing is if in present in presenting your goal

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.660
is primarily entertainment.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.380
It's not the delivery of the content.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.340
Absolutely.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.860
And that's like the step in between there.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.820
And I've been trying some different, I learned a technique.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.340
I haven't pulled it off really well yet, but someday I'll give a talk where I can

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.300
pull it off.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.100
It's this five by five technique where you start with a story, you don't finish

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.740
it.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.020
And you go into another story and then you kind of build this inner loop and

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.020
kind of get the fourth or fifth story.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.940
You tell the ending to that story.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.340
And then in weaving your talk, the ending to the, after the fifth story, the fourth

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.340
story, then the ending to the third story.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.780
And then people are waiting for, they're waiting all for the, they know at the end

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.060
they get the answer in the punch line to the story you started at the beginning.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:57.070
It's a really difficult technique, but in the examples I've seen, it's really

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.710
cool to watch.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.750
So I want to pull that one off sometimes, but I think if you want to be a

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.230
presenter, I think storytelling, as you mentioned, very important.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.230
How many talks have you seen about data presentation?

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.310
Again, to give test bash a plug, one of the things I liked about it is it wasn't

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.630
that, although some people bordered a little bit on it for the most part, it

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.270
was experiential and there was a story there.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.710
And I think that's really important.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.430
I hate this.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.350
So what you want to do with metrics is you want to measure things, measure them

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.550
again, but first let's look at the definition of metric and see what that

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:27.870
means.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.470
It's like, Oh my God, I want to gouge my brain out with an icicle.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.740
Um, happy.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.620
Every, so you mentioned, you know, the data presentations, even then you can

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.620
do it with a brilliant story.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.830
For example, every Ted talk I've seen where they're presenting data, right?

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.950
Those guys are good.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.790
I have not seen a sucky one of those.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.110
No abs because they can tell a story with right.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:53.550
So, so important.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.790
So anyway, this American life getting back on track here.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.430
Uh, absolutely.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.710
If you listen to those stories, you will, if you don't regurgitate those

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:07.280
stories, uh, you will, uh, you will be become a better storyteller.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.200
One of the things that we tied us back to jazz again.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.680
One of the things we always do in lessons when I was, uh, playing a lot is

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.160
in lessons.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.480
We, one of the things I always have to do is learn a solo from John

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.520
Coltrane from, uh, Sonny Stitt from Dexter Gordon, um, you know, off, off

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.250
of the recording and learn how to play it just like they do.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.900
And that's gotta be hard.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.020
We would, um, you get better at it.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.100
Cause the ear is so important.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.260
So we would do like, I would do like one a week, learn a solo a week, whether it's.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:45.140
So what happened is occasionally then when you're playing your own solos, a little

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.140
bit of those things you go, Oh, I can play that riff.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.660
I learned from that Dexter Gordon's whole earth.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.780
It fits really well right here.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.260
And those little bits of they call them quotes and those little, those quotes

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.420
come out in your own playing the same thing.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.940
If you listen to a lot of stories like this American life, like a lot of the

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:06.420
NPR shows or Ted talks or, uh, one of the podcasts I'll mention is Dan

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.580
Carlin has a couple really good podcasts.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.780
Who's named that completely forgotten one on history, which is like their

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.700
three hour podcast, but he doesn't know what sort of on politics and current

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.020
events.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.300
He's just a good storyteller.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.210
It's all by himself telling, talking about how these things work.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.250
It's very, he's very, uh, engrossing.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.650
And although I won't tell his stories, there may be an anecdote I'll pick up

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.850
and maybe from this American life, if you listen to it enough, you'll find, Hey,

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.090
you know what?

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.010
That's that relates a little bit to work.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.130
I can weave in this story in a presentation about something I'm doing

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.090
at work and those, so the exact same patterns happen.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.690
So if you, that's something that you want to be good at listening to those

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.050
things will definitely help you.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.130
It's very aligned.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.970
Like you mentioned mentioned the Ted talk, uh, they have a podcast.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.450
And so the two things, the two podcasts that I am regular listeners to

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.610
that I added this year are the Ted radio hour.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.360
Cause the other thing I think I really like about the, um, the two that I've

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.440
added, they're both very much around stories, but they're grab bags.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.320
You don't know what you're going to get on any podcasts.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.320
So I find that that opens up the realm of possibilities.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.920
Have we as we've talked about here, new ideas come from old ideas

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.800
coming together.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:36.580
So whenever I hear my Steven Johnson bone, who's the guy that wait, where

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.380
ideas come from?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.540
Yeah.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.340
Steven Johnson.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.940
Does he have a podcast?

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.060
He just started one.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.510
Okay.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.430
I'm going to, it's called wonderland.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.390
All right.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:51.230
So my third that I haven't even listened to yet will be wonderland.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.950
Okay.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:22:00.990
But the one thing that I found that I think is a gem is called 99% invisible.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.770
I have heard about that have not listened to it.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:18.300
99% invisible is a podcast around design and how design has positively and negatively impacted

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.860
the humans that interact with that design.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:33.940
So the latest episode as an example talks one second.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.820
Is it called wonderland?

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.300
Is that it?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.260
Yeah.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.140
Fantastic.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:39.820
Subscribe.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.350
Oh, Steven Johnson.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.710
I just clicked through.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.590
Oh, Brent.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:53.970
That actually is that's, that's honestly, that is better than a, than a Christmas present.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:55.010
Good.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.810
Cause that's all I got.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:56.130
Yeah.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:02.160
I mean, I just liked the, the, the latest podcast is called the, the plat of Zaya.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:12.590
And it's about salt lake city and how bring them young designed the city.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:21.840
And they have these 660 acre blocks, which is, I believe nine times larger than a normal

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.640
New York block.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:30.900
And the streets are like, um, I want to say 120 yards across.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.940
So a traditional stoplight signal.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.100
They have problems with it.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:42.500
Because if pedestrian starting to walk the traditional timing for pedestrians,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.620
they're in the middle of the street when it gets to don't walk.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:53.420
So there's the, um, they're going through how that initial design benefited and then

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.900
how it changed, uh, society later and what they're trying to do about it.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:03.420
Like it, it's a brilliantly named, uh, podcast, 99% invisible.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.940
I've added it to my list.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.180
Yeah.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:06.500
Okay.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.420
So, so mine are like, I'm looking at my list now.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.420
So I remember that the Ophira Eisenberg hosted chill on NPR is called ask me another.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.080
And it is, uh, while wait, wait, don't tell me is, uh, news related trivia from the week.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.960
It's a great way to catch up.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.760
The fun way to catch up on news, uh, ask me another is just rant like stupid word

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.920
games to play this game called this, that, or the other, which I find kind of hilarious.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.080
And one of it's one of the games they play.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.840
And what they do is they'll give you a name and like they'll pick three categories.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.360
Like what was the one yesterday?

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:45.470
A national park, Japanese movie monster, or I forget the other one, something else.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.590
And they give you a name like to try geeky.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:55.550
And so it's just, it's not like any, any information you would use

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.910
ever elsewhere, but it's fun to hear people.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.710
It's just, it's just, it's a good commute.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.790
Listen for me for those.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.230
So do you listen to Freakonomics?

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:06.910
I don't.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:07.630
Okay.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.390
Occasionally if I'm out of other podcasts,

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:16.030
Stephen Dubner has a new one that it's, uh, tell us something we don't know where he,

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.310
he invites participants to come in and just tell a story of that.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.710
They expect people to not know already.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.630
It's really random.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.080
Um, but you learn something from every participant.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.280
Okay.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.280
So back to my turn.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.080
So the podcast, I listened to the most again, most of the same as last year.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.040
Uh, I'm what I haven't mentioned so far.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.680
The Dan Carlin shows are common sense with Dan Carlin.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.200
I like his history show is called Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.290
I don't think he even does that show anymore.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:53.890
But, uh, if you can go back to the back episodes, uh, he does these like seriously,

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.880
like three hour long podcast talking about, you know, the Cuban missile crisis or,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.160
or the, the plague or any chunk of history.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.280
He will actually make it interesting for three hours,

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.440
which I get is great for the long road trip.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:09.840
Right.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.480
A lot of fun.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.840
Uh, only other thing interesting on here is I do listen to total soccer show.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.640
Of course you do catch up on things.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.440
Congratulations.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.240
Sounders.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.880
Stephen Dubner also does a soccer show with his son.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.960
Oh, there are too many soccer shows made listen to them all.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.680
I used to listen to the one from, uh, MLS major league soccer sponsors,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.640
one called extra time, which is awful.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.520
I listened to it for a while.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.720
I just couldn't stand it.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.280
I just couldn't stand it.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:39.920
I'm sorry.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.200
So, but you need a hug.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:41.440
No.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.160
So anyway, that's kind of my podcast list.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.000
I was on the testing show this year and we'll check out that podcast from time to time.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:55.840
Uh, and I did, I don't think it's a really regular podcast.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.120
Now I recorded a little short with Mark Tomlinson, who was one of the three

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.760
for a little test bash pre-show.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.870
He's on the East coast.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.630
I think we did it like five in the morning.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.670
My time.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.610
Jinkies.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.170
Jinkies.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:09.410
Right.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:10.530
Jink.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:10.690
Yeah.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.690
You're so weird, Brent.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.630
So anyway, those are my favorites.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.310
Those are the ones that get regular play in my car on my commutes to work.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.770
And I will be listening to a lot of these on that drive to Bozeman, Montana.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.540
I need to.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:29.620
Okay.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:30.420
All right.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.220
What's up next?

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.980
What blogs are you plugging for 2016?

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:48.060
So as I was prepping through this, I realized that not except for prepping for this show,

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:58.780
this is the year where I didn't proactively go out and follow up on, on, um, testing podcasts

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.580
or not podcasts, uh, blogs.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:08.940
Like the, the closest thing I would say to that is, uh, anytime you post something

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.760
because I have the notification on, I read it, but I don't, you're so lame.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:22.640
I don't even, I don't even think I would classify yours as a, uh, testing blog as much as I would

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.920
have say a couple of years ago.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.560
For sure.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.120
For sure.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.200
And interesting.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.640
I was going to bring up the same point.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.240
I still read a lot of blogs.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.920
I go through my blog list usually daily and flip through it and it's half software engineering

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.920
blogs, half other things I'm interested in software engineering, including testing.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.440
There's a few, I won't pull out any names, but you readers could imagine.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.920
There's a few blogs I read just to see if someone's going to say something

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.990
extra exceptionally stupid or thought provoking or interesting.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.870
Everyone want to look at it.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:57.790
Well, the, the, the, the test related blogs that I have read read rather are when listeners

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:03.580
or you, um, have sent it our way as sort of podcast fodder.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:14.750
Uh, the I am reminded of the, the episode we talked about, uh, in this last year, um,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.990
on the box, uh, controversial slide.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.350
Oh yeah.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.470
Well, there was the right.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:27.870
There was the whole thing on agile is coming to get you, you, you,

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.870
agile hate your doors.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.310
Agile hates testers.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.610
What does it?

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.670
Hates testers.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.690
Agile hates testers.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:45.670
Yeah, so for me, two blogs that I am going to totally screw up,

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.340
but I spent a lot of time on nowadays,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:56.620
is number one, it's cleverly named AndrewJellman.com

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.780
and Data Mining Blog.com.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:06.300
Both of these are applied data science blogs.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.020
They both are around, they simplify,

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.180
they give you techniques to observe,

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.860
and they open up things to a lot more people.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.140
They're not data science blogs for data scientists.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.920
Oh, I need that one.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.120
I need data science for non-data scientists

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.690
and people that aren't very good at math.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.700
This is something that I'm thinking about

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.600
changing my blog towards.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.760
So I've been doing a lot of ML in my day-to-day life.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.120
Machine learning.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.040
Thank you.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040
You're welcome.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.930
And I have one of my employees who is just a brilliant guy.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.210
Hey, it's Talon.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.650
And about this point in the audio,

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:58.690
things start going badly and they only get worse.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.170
So we'll finish up this topic.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:06.130
And Brett now, kick off 2017 at episode 52

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.710
with a rehash of our 2017 predictions.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:14.670
But he can be, he can tend on the impatient side.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:18.190
So this data science thing, he immediately sort of goes,

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.710
this is hard and it's math-y

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.120
and I don't want to get involved in it.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.040
But he's a smart kid.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:31.720
And he started doing Azure ML.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.760
And he realized that by observing what I've been doing,

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.560
that he was able to apply some of those basics

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.800
that he's picked up and immediately start rolling

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.830
on Azure ML.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:50.980
So I'm thinking through this idea of also helping

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:58.000
to simplify things as well as get better myself on Azure ML.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.880
Send me a link to that blog.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.440
Yeah.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.880
And I will put it in the show notes

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.280
and add it to my own feed as well.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.540
I'll send you the positive thing about me having notes

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.300
is I can send you the whole bloody thing.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.460
Oh, great.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.750
Blog pose.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.870
There were two that were really interesting to me this year.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:23.310
One was from knowledgetester.org.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:28.390
And it was on the generalist versus specialist discussion.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:35.520
And I recently wrote a blog on this sort of topic

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:41.500
where I go through the history of where specialists come from.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:47.300
And we kind of, I'd say, accidentally collaborated.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.940
But he invented this thing called a pie-shaped tester.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.180
Pie as in the Greek letter.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:53.980
OK.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.900
Which is like, there's a thing called a tree-shaped,

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.140
or a T-shaped tester.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:57.620
Right.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.380
T-shaped persona.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.140
It's a T, but with one more depth skill set.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.380
Great.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.300
And then the last one, which I will,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.180
I think this is something that everyone should listen to based

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.500
off of our data.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.180
Or not listen to.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:14.820
It's a blog post.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.980
I'll just click correct you later.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.700
You can have Cortana read it to you.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.700
On the Data Mining blog, one of the posts that they did

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.660
was the five most common data relationships

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.460
shown through visualization.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.180
So I think one of the first places people need to get into,

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.420
and we talked about this in the past,

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:41.310
is how valuable just staring at histograms are.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:46.510
And they wrote a blog post around different, most

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.070
five common relationships where you can look at it and go,

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.180
ooh, I see something there that's

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.260
worthwhile to dig in further.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:55.760
Cool.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.340
Interesting.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.660
That's it for me on the blog post.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.220
How about you?

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.740
I gave this one last year, but I'll give it again.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.220
I'm going to try and print out.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.220
I probably screwed up her name last year, too.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.100
But I got to meet Merit at Test Bash.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:13.320
But Merit, oh my gosh.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.760
I looked this up last year.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.800
Merit, who has at visible-quality.blogspot.com,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.080
has her season testers crystal ball.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.780
And her role is so much like mine.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:33.180
She knows testing, and she's on an Agile team.

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.100
My team's not really Agile, so maybe it's not that close.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.340
They like to think they are.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.700
But that's a whole other topic.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.660
But it's not as much fragile your team.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.140
She blogs almost every day.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.020
And everything is, I have to read them all.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.740
Because she does a good job.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.180
And oh, yeah.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.060
I've done that.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.860
That's cool.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.580
Oh, new perspective.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.500
Cool.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.460
Really impressed by her blog post.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.740
I'm jealous of both that capability.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.540
And even yours.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.140
When I sit down to do a blog post,

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.980
I know the next four hours of my life are dedicated to this.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.180
So you can just, and it's a brilliant blog post.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.100
Depending on your definition of brilliant.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.300
OK, happy 2016.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.780
We'll see you in 2017.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.500
I'm Alan.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.580
I'm Britt.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.580
And we're done.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.020
Happy holidays all the time.
