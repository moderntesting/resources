00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.300
This is where the clever soundbite goes at the beginning

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.870
Welcome to a B testing podcast your modern testing podcast

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.670
Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.770
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.500
Hello all three of you. This is Alan. This is Brent and we're back again. It's a B testing

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.980
Not AI testing. It's a B testing. But here we are. How's it going, Brent?

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.300
Going going it's going it's going

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.940
Week here already today

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.930
I'm

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.770
deeply considering the new hobby of alcoholism immediately following this meeting or this

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
recording

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.370
I'm going out tonight, but yeah, we'll figure that part out later. I am

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.850
Yeah, where you going? Um

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.930
Century ballroom in Seattle has been around for a year 28 years and they are closing down

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.610
They decided not to renew their lease and I think the people that run it are gonna retire ready to go to their big party

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.690
down the block here

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.410
Fine. So that's my plans for tonight. So you're gonna go drinking and dancing pretty much pretty much

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.890
Except I don't know any of the dances that are before like they're doing like an all-night thing

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.850
It's well, it'll be fun. It's mostly a people watching thing looking forward to it and then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.810
Going out tomorrow night and then Sunday heading off to New York for work for a week

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.350
Okay, that's it man exciting. Oh

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.030
The big peach no Apple no come quiet. I know what it is

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.220
All right

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.460
All right. Well, we are here again. This is just for those of you new to the podcast

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.180
I know you know what I've been watching listeners. We're saturated

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.540
We don't get any new ones ever. It's the same three people every week listening to the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.340
Just a race to see who every week ha every two or three weeks as we find time

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.020
It's a race to see who's gonna listen to it first

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.260
Who's gonna be the one wait, you know the who's you have that down? No, of course. I don't I don't know anything

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.260
Okay, that would be PII. I don't know

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.780
It's there's people and they listen to the podcast and hello people. Hi Tim

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.980
There's probably a few others we know by name. What if Jim Jim Oh still listens. Oh

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.900
Hey Jim, how's it going? I don't know where these people work I

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.560
Yeah, so many layoffs

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.750
weird time to be in the industry

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.750
Do you want to get into it or do you what do you want to do? You want to talk about?

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.400
Anything actually, what are you watching? What are you a binging recently? I've gone old-school

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520
I've decided to go back to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.350
1997 and

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.350
I am binge watching

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.830
Babylon 5. Oh, I remember that show. I remember that show. I've been watching. I don't if you get max

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.270
Yes, you do read it anymore. I did. I've been watching the pit on there with

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.990
Noah Wiley, it's it's

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.190
It's really it's it's good. I like it

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.510
It reminded me go back and watch the first episode of ER. What is like a little teeny, baby? That was kind of funny

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.750
So yeah that I looked at the Oscar nominations

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.530
I have seen a nun of except for Dune 2 I've seen none of the movies

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.710
So I am really out of touch in that department and I watched the Grammys a few weeks ago

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.150
And do not think Beyonce had the best country album last year, but whatever it's a political thing and it's not a bad album

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.190
And there's no way the AI Beatles should have won best rock song. There's my takeaway on the Grammys. I

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.280
Did not watch the Grammys

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.220
It hasn't been something that

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.180
Anyone in my house has cared about for ever

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.630
Yeah, I'm consistent on

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.170
not caring

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.890
What people not close to me?

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.720
Are doing

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.980
All right. Yeah, do you want to get into the thing we're gonna talk about? Yeah, I was just

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.900
The meantime I was looking at Jimbo and looks like he went to Moby games

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.500
I don't know. I was thinking Jim Jim. Oh not Jimbo. Oh

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.580
Because he used to listen to the podcast I don't know if Jimbo ever did

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.540
Nobody knows what we're talking about

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.060
We had Patrick on one of the three dot slack calm

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.220
Jimbo though

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.280
like to me

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.680
He he was doing data science and test before anyone knew that he was doing that

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.560
He was fantastic. Yeah, I liked him a lot. I liked them both a lot

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.560
I felt bad cuz I made Jim Mo come work for me and then I quit

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.200
So that didn't go so well

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.640
On one of the three dot slack calm our slack group

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.520
You can get an invitation link by going to modern testing org and reading a little bit and finding the link

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.440
You don't need to sign anything. You don't need to pay anything. You can show up and you can do whatever you want there

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.280
We do have a code of conduct should be nice and treat each other nicely

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.400
But you can ask questions and sometimes we'll make fun of I mean answer those questions on the podcast

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.280
Patrick said I don't remember hearing a mailbag. Oh a mailbag about this topic specifically

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.640
But maybe it can serve as a palate cleanser between discussions about AI and I and we definitely need a palate cleanser

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640
But you know we need more than that

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.720
Yes

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.840
We need the mailbag sound effect because it's we haven't played that in a long time

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.280
I haven't played that in a long time if you want to hear more of that just ask us some frickin questions. God, right?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.980
otherwise, we just

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.860
Make shit up. All right. I'm gonna read this. There's a lot here. We're gonna come back to this

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.430
I'm gonna go through the whole question and we're gonna talk about all of it this year

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.450
I became the tech lead for my team some context

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.210
I am transitioning from a quality engineering role to a development role in my organization

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.910
The tech leads role is to help team members overcome challenges provide feedback to act as a contact for the manager and keep everyone motivated

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.190
So I guess standard stuff

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.910
My team consists only of senior developers who perform at a high level and previous tech leads that set a high standard

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.750
My current focus is on improving our processes and the way we work

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:59.670
Which I feel confident about and my strategy is to ask the right questions and help to help remove bottlenecks in their daily tasks

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.450
Either by asking questions or escalating issues when needed

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.030
What I'm unsure about is how to stay on top of unknowns and such senior team

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.950
Since their technical knowledge is greater than mine and I'm not sure I'm missing any signals from them

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.070
I want to introduce one-on-ones to fixes

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:20.030
But maybe there's still something else if you have any recommendations or materials could help in situation. I would really appreciate it

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:26.110
So my answer the last one just listen to a bunch of the podcast back before we start talking about AI

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.550
But uh, let's get your reactions and then we can dive in here. Oh

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.620
I'm ready to dive in. Oh, but let me react them. Okay, so I

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.980
Love it. I think this is a modern way to work. I

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.850
Well, no, I'm gonna finish here

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.770
Not not the first time facing this problem

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:56.130
I've been in very similar and I'm gonna problem been in very similar roles myself or put people on my team into these roles

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.310
I love I kind of love the context

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.810
I love where he's starting from so many people start this question and say I don't know what to do

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.810
I'm not empowered. I can't do anything. I love that

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.090
Patrick is starting from a really good place. Sounds like he knows what to do

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.010
Just looking for some tips

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.330
He wants to recognize where the unknown unknowns are and there are there are ways to do that

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.610
We'll talk about those and one-on-ones is one of those things. So all in all down the right track

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:32.090
So that's just me just nodding my head going. Okay, this is gonna be fun. But let's dive in right? Okay

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.070
My first response

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.880
And I don't know to what degree we'll repeat it here today

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.080
But we've talked about this before

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.080
drink drink

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.730
So first thing I'll say is go back and visit

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.510
episode

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.630
119

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:01.710
Homework before that wait, did you do homework before the podcast? No Spotify has a really good search engine

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:09.630
Because I was confident we had done that one before and we had and it's cleverly titled

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.190
Retrospectives because that is what I think

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.150
So yeah do one-on-ones

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.620
but

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.220
bring in

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.920
my first two questions is

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:31.560
Do you guys have a board? Do you guys have something in which you are making the invisible visible?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.320
Do you have because you talk about bottlenecks and when I when I see that I'm like there is nothing

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.640
That I have seen

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.660
ever in software development that works better at identifying

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.500
bottlenecks

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.980
than a combo board like

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.540
Yes 80%

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.510
It isn't just having the combine board. Let me finish. Let me finish. Let me finish

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.270
It's asking questions like what work is remaining to move this item to the right?

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.350
That's where you discover the bottlenecks and the things like the unknown thing because having the board

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.350
Now the things are there the things that blocking them aren't there by default

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.710
the reason why I say the con button board and not a scrum board or

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.420
Whatever the the cool kids are using nowadays, you know

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.890
Scrum ban or whatever

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:36.040
In particular the concept of whip right whip

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.350
If you have a team that's enforcing whip

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:46.510
Then the combine board will show you where your bottleneck is and then you add that

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:52.390
When when tickets are getting done if you add it your religious discussion

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.860
I've always recommended a weekly meeting

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.260
where you go through and you

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.600
you talk about

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.600
you retrospect on

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.490
On the tickets that you got done

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.490
I I generally like to look at the ones that took the most amount of time

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.360
I

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.380
Have my team draw what's called a value stream map

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:25.280
Where you look at the timeline for that ticket and and you just very simply draw a line across the whiteboard

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.330
But you shift the line up every time there's active work being done

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:37.540
And then you bring the line back down every time the ticket is idle and then you can just see the periods of activity

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.100
and

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.100
Idleness, and then you can start asking targeted questions around Oh

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.980
Like okay. So why was that ticket idle for you know, ten days or oh

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:56.780
Really? What were you doing during this time that like you were active on on this ticket for ten days during this time?

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.900
What were you?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.860
What were you doing during that time and it ends up?

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.380
Being a great tool to have a discussion around

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:12.100
What are the things that are slowing us? I am a fan of value stream map, so I'm not gonna poop with that at all

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.100
But you can have those Patrick can have those conversations before someone's had the ticket for ten days

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.940
If something's in a column for ten days, it's gonna get asked about

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.120
Right, right. No, no, no because it's block. It's it's blocking a whip. It's blocking other work from making it into that column

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:36.160
I'm calm. I'm combining all of the things that I know that are fantastic for this one

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.520
Like if you if you have a cam band board with whip, right now the idea with whip is

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.440
You limit the number of tickets that are allowed in that column, okay

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.180
And it ends up being really frustrating particularly if you do a good job on honoring whip

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.640
like the person

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.760
Who's trying to move a ticket into that column can't because that columns exceeding whip

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.440
Get where you're coming from because I know I know what you're talking about

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:14.220
Let me rephrase this for those who may be lost at this point. All right what you're get I'm not picking on you

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.040
I'm just phrasing it differently because you haven't said this directly because you know it too well

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.840
I'm going I'm actually being supportive. So shut up. I'm crying Jesus

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.440
Christ

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.720
What you what you're doing

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.620
When you use again people use combine they use it wrong

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.720
But if you use whip we're in progress for those who are following along

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:42.160
You're going to and you put those at reasonable numbers. It's going to highlight where the bottlenecks are

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:49.520
it's gonna highlight the unknown unknowns that someone like Patrick is looking for because stuff is gonna get blocked and you can figure out why one

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.000
moving from column to column it to why is stuff stuck in this column forever and

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.760
There's a fun

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.800
Kanban game. I played a long time ago or it really helps you figure out like

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.280
Like the first time you play it's all completely broken you screw everything up and you learn stuff

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.840
You figure how to make stuff flow through the board, which is how Kanban works when you use it correctly

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.960
You have been in a little bubble of your teens using Kanban very well for a very long time

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.880
Out in the real world probably elsewhere at Microsoft. There are teens with a Kanban board

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:28.490
Maybe with whip but the whip numbers are like 12 for every column and shit just sits there all over the place

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.010
It's a big freakin mess. So done, right? I

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.650
My teams use scrum now

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:43.010
Again for those of you I put it's not a lot scrum was around before the agile manifesto

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.210
It was just convenient for teams to do a little mini waterfall every two weeks. It's fine

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.930
There's a lot of good things come from it. I I'm a big believer in

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.650
Kanban especially for

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:59.530
Work that's primarily it's a lot reaction driven. But anyway, I prefer Kanban blah blah blah

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.450
But you got to do it right you can't half-ass it

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:08.530
It's gonna highlight it's gonna help you figure out where the bottlenecks are where the unknown unknowns are and then do the retros

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.950
not just on

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.600
Not just on what

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.120
Didn't go. Well, what what sorry do the retros not just on

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:27.300
Why was this item stuck but what was hard what was frustrating, you know get get the questions do the continuous improvement as we both said many times

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.960
Maybe I maybe only I've said this I think you said it too other than your one-on-one with your manager

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.840
The team retro is the most important meaning you could have yes

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.000
Full agreement cool. I actually think it's

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.640
Particularly for my staff. It's even more important than their one-on-one with their manager

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.640
I

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.320
Know not not all leaders are created equal Jensen

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.760
the

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.000
in again episode 119

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.990
I'm like there's two types of retros. I could bring back up

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.590
There's the weekly and then the quarterly one that I propose I'm pretty certain we talked about it there

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.240
The the other important question that I find

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.620
Particularly in retro. So number one

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.800
Alan was right when the board is act or when when you have an active ticket on the board

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:32.550
It's more important to ask what help do you need to move this ticket to the next column?

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:41.640
Okay, that's that's probably the single most important question the single stupidest question is what is the status of this ticket?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.640
the

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.720
and then in retrospective what I have found is

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.520
The single most important question in retrospective is

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:03.390
What did the team fail to do to help you get this ticket done sooner?

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:08.440
hmm, so my take on retrospective is

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.100
is

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:19.850
That whoever owned the ticket by deaf and inside of retrospective by definition. They were are perfect

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:25.420
They did everything right. They did the best they could it was the team

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.050
That let them down and by taking that angle

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:40.760
The team starts getting involved in yeah

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.960
Well, the reason the way I let you down is that I I saw that this ticket is there and I didn't ask you for help

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.960
I picked up some new work

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.520
Right it it gets the team

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.540
Self introspecting around hey, they are not working as a team

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.220
They're letting this this one to get this one person flounder, right?

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.500
Um

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:12.700
Patrick Patrick Patrick is going through and he's taking on a one-man mission to remove the bottlenecks

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:20.380
But the best way you can really get those bottlenecks going is creating an environment where that's a team responsibility

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.700
not just

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.020
the technique like

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.020
Alan actually there's there's no one better

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.830
that I have met than Alan on

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:38.010
identifying problems and getting the community to work through a

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.930
solution in a safe place

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:50.430
Sharing some of the tricks that I have used I don't have that one's awesome skill set in that

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.680
Magic now

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.400
Alan I'll turn it back to you and say hey

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.080
What what are things that you is suggest here number one and number two in particular?

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.760
Because everything we've just spent the last 20 minutes talking about

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.560
relies on

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:15.000
Some form of an agile process including the retro stuff. Yeah. Yeah, and that's that's gonna set up a lot of this stuff

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
What would you do if you didn't have that?

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.440
And and I'm not good and of course the obvious answer. Well, I would start it is

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.440
Yes

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.780
I

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.860
Have done I have look people I'm up. I'm a music major. I

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:40.260
Learned how to code I've written a lot of good code, but I've always worked with people who are better developers to me

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.140
but

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.140
It's this art of discernment this art of critical thinking and asking questions

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.020
You don't need to know more in order to do it

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:56.660
You just need to ask like if you did these senior developers if you could ask them questions to get them to reflect

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.380
You're gonna get all of the knowledge you need in order to help them be successful

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.660
so you're sure they have senior developers and and

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.980
Doesn't the Sun need they they know what they're doing?

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:16.350
One-on-ones help ask them questions like do you do little mini retros? What's the hardest part about your job and

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:23.350
See if there are patterns there ask them questions like when they're implementing something ask

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.870
You know pull out the Weinberg card. What other solutions should we have considered here?

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.750
Like red flags for me is when the developer says this is the first solution. I thought of it's correct

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.440
How do you know it's the right one? Just

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.040
You know Weinberg says until you come up with at least three solutions for your problem

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.840
You'll understand your problem well enough you can get people focused on well

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.560
Are we solving the problem in the best way for the customer?

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:50.150
Those you don't need technical knowledge to answer those questions. What you need is to help

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:57.910
Give people like a system thinking approach to what they're going to deliver. It's so much coaching you can do

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:06.630
Regardless of agile waterfall V model, whatever you want to do refrigerator model, which is my favorite. I don't know how it works

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.470
shut the door and turn the light turns off but

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.150
Just ask questions to get people to think a little bit get them to

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.410
You and I have known a lot of really good developers and not all most of these developers

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.330
They are anxious to get their solution coded and done

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:30.130
We can do a lot of value in I call it a coach role. It could be a tech lead role. It could be

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.910
just another developer role of

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:40.090
Asking people to just reflect a little bit more get them to slow down a little bit and think about what they're doing

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.670
There's a whole bag full of tricks of questions you can ask. So that's where I would start

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.990
then then

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.690
also

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:54.290
Being a good developer doesn't necessarily or being a senior developer doesn't necessarily mean you deliver quality software

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.330
Doesn't mean you're focused on there's so much to a quality culture

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.250
So what do you do?

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:05.850
You pull out the quality culture transition guide and you look at you can get from there's there's a link in the slack

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.570
You could just search for quality culture transition guide. It's somewhere out there

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.360
or yeah, you'll find it and

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:19.920
Look at a bunch of different attributes that we expect teams to work on together including the approach to quality bug backlogs

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.760
Design approaches coverage approaches test approaches figure out what's missing

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.800
You can one thing

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.720
Developers may do it sounds like moving from QA into develop. Maybe the team doesn't have testers anymore

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.400
There is an opportunity to

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:43.920
Educate folks on different test ideas and techniques depending on what they're making something that may not be

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.520
Completely like there was well does write unit tests, but I need a tester to write the real test

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.360
No, you don't help them write the better tests help them and contextual

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.600
15 years ago or so when model-based testing was super exciting and everybody is

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.560
People it didn't work for a lot of teams because they tried to apply it to places where model-based testing would work

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.210
introducing developers to different whether it's contract testing or model-based testing or

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:22.010
Even automation and post ban for API testing if they don't know it is it is a great way to help them understand their unknown unknowns

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:29.910
And you I think your unknowns on our knowns. In fact, I got a specter Patrick question is how do I stay on top of the unknowns?

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.130
The things that you don't know are what they don't know

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.270
So you need to figure out what their unknown unknowns are so they can be something that you know

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.630
They don't know so you can help them help them make that something they know

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:50.120
If you if you don't read Philip armor, you cannot follow that. So please go read Philip armors five orders of ignorance and come back

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.180
but there are

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:58.020
It's really to me summary in my three-minute soapbox here is

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.120
You can I can work with the most senior developers in the world

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.440
I just have to ask them questions and get them to reflect and think about what they're doing

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:14.480
I'm not gonna take it. It'll just a little sprinkle here and there but that's that's what that's what good coaching is

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.250
agreed

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:24.710
I'll respond now and summarize a couple of thoughts that I had based of what Alan just said, but first I'll say

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.250
the quality culture transition guide

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.010
can be found at

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:41.430
GitHub.com slash modern testing one word slash resources. Whoo. Yeah, I went mutant figure that out

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:49.080
As well as all kinds of random related things

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.120
Although I do like

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.320
The mural board that was produced by the listener years ago

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.730
So

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:09.680
First and foremost if you if you don't want to do any of the other structural components

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.720
Okay, and and like all of these things you can take them and all a cart menu

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.600
You could do all of them. You could do one of them

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.640
Right. I suppose you could do none of them

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.280
But you did ask us the question. So I don't propose that as an option

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.720
I

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:39.240
First and foremost if the developers are more senior than you, okay, then I find then

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.590
Assuming that they actually

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:49.350
Already know the answer to their question. They already know how to do this

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.600
they just focused on something else or

00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:01.030
It's not top of mind or they can't think of how to do it cheaply, right?

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:10.020
So create an environment where you encourage change agents to try to be

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.580
change agents

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.220
Is a good thing

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.480
The coaching habit that I was gonna recommend that is

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:27.360
Is in terms of everything that alan just talked about if you want a structure or you want a great approach

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:36.320
Again, nothing better than that. I have encountered than the content within that book. Okay the hardest

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.120
thing

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.640
in in the role that Patrick describes

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.960
Sounds like won't be so hard for him

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.760
Because the hardest thing for for most people I know of

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.560
to execute

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:00.840
The practices in the coaching habit habit is to not jump in and problem solve

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.040
Mm-hmm, right? Yeah, cause

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:09.400
And if you don't know how to problem solve then you're perfectly suited for the techniques in this book

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.280
It's about asking the right questions

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.840
Right and pausing

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.240
Um, i'm a big fan of the Socratic method

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.240
right the the anytime i'm talking with with my employees or

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.160
Mentees or even people that come to me for problems

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.160
right

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.160
I like to play a little game

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.840
In in the game is can I ask the right questions that aren't leading questions

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:45.270
And get them themselves to say a solution at least what?

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.160
right

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.160
um

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.840
because

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.160
Getting them asking the right questions and getting them to say the solution

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.530
Helps not only the thought process, but the solution to stick

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.010
Versus like if I have to direct a solution

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:12.130
Right how how i'm going to be interpreted is going to be is

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.360
going to depend on

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.800
Um, so I I speak i'm a top-down communicator I speak in strategic terms abstract terms

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.640
And so if you're a detailed or a new person

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.280
You might take a literal view on what i'm saying if you are an abstract person

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.280
You might take an abstract but a different interpretation of what i'm saying

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.880
right, um

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.000
Going into the Socratic method and the coaching habit are just fantastic techniques. Yeah, and

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.670
And it's it's fun and getting out of anyway lots of coaching there. In fact, you it's interesting

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.030
I was trying to remember the name of the author. Uh bungie bungie b-u-n-g-a-y

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.990
I started with the name of the book. I do remember the author. But you know while I was talking this is all I was

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.750
I was glad it was

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.830
Started over again. I'm not going to edit this because I I gave up on editing a while back but

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.590
Uh, that's what I was thinking about when I was giving the questions. It's um

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.070
it's uh

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:18.790
Coaching habit great great ideas there and I remember I have one more thing to bring up. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Okay, whatever

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.030
So so far we have talked about

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.270
I would say two big things

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.630
Um number one coaching habit Socratic method

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.550
um

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.550
Great influencer when you're one-on-one

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.600
okay, um

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.520
Something like a Kanban board or a scrum board great structural

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.360
Influencer to help to help identify these um

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.660
these bottlenecks

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.280
What about social?

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.280
How do you as a tech lead

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.560
get

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.840
your team

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.840
To talk amongst each other

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.440
To solve this problem. Oh

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.560
I think now I would argue at your retrospective is absolutely a way to do that

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.720
What are others?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.680
Well

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.680
I would say that could be a way

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.600
I'll phrase it differently and then i'll answer it

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.800
It's another way to find out what those unknown unknowns are is begin to build some community around the dev team

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.250
Is get them get I mean whether it's

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.200
facilitating or organizing some you know architecture sharing a group code review a

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.900
presentation on an approach

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.280
A presentation on a particular tool whether it's a test tool debugging tool somebody's used

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.640
Get them to again. These are creates going back to philip armor

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.800
Create suitable means for your dev team to just get rest your dev team to discover what they don't know. They don't know

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.760
So you can have a bunch of developers who are very good in siloed bits. They know their little bit

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.600
They don't know how this stuff works

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.600
Uh, you can create

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:08.520
A learning organization as peters and gay would say in the fifth one by giving them opportunities to see each other are doing and

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.660
Inspiring curiosity

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.160
So that's what I you know me i'm the community guy, of course

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.440
That's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna get them all to learn from each other because i'm too lazy to do it any other way

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.320
I was reading an article the other day

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.280
And you disinspired something

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.920
because the

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.760
When you talked up i'm like, oh, yeah, he's right, right?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.800
Did you think i was gonna give a different answer? No, if you inspire creativity that

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.320
Creativity you need community and a safe place to inspire that creativity

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.240
Sorry, i'm dying for some reason

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.600
All right. This is the last in testing podcast because b is having a heart attack

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.320
We're back next week with the a testing vodka

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.280
a testing

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.220
the

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.860
Sorry, uh me my attempt to die

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.660
Definitely derailed the train of thought

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.110
Um

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.280
Let me see if I can bring it back

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.200
No, it's gone

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:20.720
But that's where innovation comes that's where I mean, oh I got it. Sorry. Thank you

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.360
I'm your inspiration. So article I was reading

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.120
And it was talking about

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.720
um

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.400
the

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.400
the debate against

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:44.660
Uh when the age AGI is going to exist i'm not going into that. Hey, we're not talking about it

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.540
This is a palate cleanser. Yeah, careful. Careful

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.580
But but

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.720
what they argue

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.320
is

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.200
That the jobs of the future are no longer going to be knowledge worker

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.040
But the jobs are going to be the future are going to be those

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.680
who have curiosity

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.360
creativity

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.860
ideation

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.540
and

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.540
Whether or not that's true. I don't effing care. Okay

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:21.570
But it is true. It's always been true. This is just accelerating that please go on

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.610
well, so exclusively versus

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.390
not

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.800
okay

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.520
but that leads me into the discussion of

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.310
um

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.470
You definitely want to

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.910
So again talking about cultural things community

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:48.790
Like we talked about individual stuff then we talked about structure and now we're talking about the team social

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.310
Okay

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.270
um

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.270
You want to create an environment?

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.050
in my humble opinion

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.170
that

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.850
vigorously

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.850
maybe even aggressively

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.530
Encourage

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.780
the growth mindset

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.820
I i'm gonna uh, yes, and you want to do that. Anyway, I would like to point out

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:19.840
That dan pink we refer to often on this podcast most famous for drive autonomy mastery and purpose

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.300
in

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.600
2006

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.050
2006

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.210
19 years ago

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.210
Wrote a book called a whole new mind

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:31.970
subtitle

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:35.970
Why right brainers aka creative folks will rule the world?

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.760
I read that book in 2006 and as a sort of a right brainer. I thought yep

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.960
He's right. I he's everything. He says makes sense. His book. I think is more relevant today

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.680
Than it was 19 years ago

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.470
I'm gonna go reread it

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:57.770
Because it's just what you just said people it's this creativity

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:04.530
Is going to rule the world in in the with ais and agi's and abc's and defs

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.400
The

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:16.040
Future belongs to a different kind of person with a different kind of mind artists inventors storytellers creative and holistic right brain thinkers

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.400
Whose abilities mark the fault line between who gets ahead and who doesn't we need storytellers?

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.560
We need creative people. We need inventors

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.800
We don't need a bunch of people who can crank out algorithms anymore

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.870
Buy your time's over

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.360
Sorry

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.360
There's always exceptions to the rule, but

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.800
Right. It's the same thing. I'm always right

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.570
Yeah

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.570
Yes, no, it's sure

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:49.090
Okay, good enough. I I will I will agree with everything you just said right there's these

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.190
Right the the whole meme on test is dead

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:57.590
Well, no, you right. Well cobalt still not dead

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.440
Right. It's like look

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.100
Are we talking targeting the dominant?

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.260
People are we talking the the three people still?

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.440
working in

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:16.600
1997 I am so sick of those people as a as a brief tangent as our podcast is famous for

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.730
like

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.450
There are certain people every time they find a bug in some

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:27.030
Software they talk like this is why we need software testers

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:33.330
And here's something every bit of software ever shipped has bugs in it. All right

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.010
Some are bad. Some are really bad. Most aren't

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:40.260
just

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.660
deliver quality to your customers

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.330
quickly

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.730
quality software at a sustainable pace

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.310
Um, I I just I just don't get it like this

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.430
It's so much anyway, yeah, I haven't gotten it in a while and

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.990
there are

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:05.030
Every now and again even in today's world it pops up again. Oh, can we um,

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:11.510
I have one more topic. I want to talk about sure, but are we are we are we good for patrick?

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.350
I i'm good for patrick patrick. Thank you for asking the question

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.030
Uh, if you want to hear your name called out on the ab testing podcast

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.910
Send us a freaking question. Give us something to talk about

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:27.190
Something I meant to bring up, uh last week. Well, but then we didn't record i'm gonna bring it up now

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:32.870
Okay, and it's it felt kind of related for a minute, but I can't remember why to do a reasonable segue

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:34.710
uh

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.270
We from time to time have guests

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.970
On the ab testing pod. That is true. I have been there. Yeah and

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.350
Honestly, the reason we don't have more

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.520
Is one we're shitty at interviews

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.250
Two

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.010
Brent we're not popular. Brent and I can barely

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.890
Figure out when we're gonna meet

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:06.130
Let alone bring in somebody else sure and so that's so coordination stuff. I don't have a producer to go coordinate that

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:11.090
And it could get easier. I will I don't know if you know this I get an email

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.730
Probably twice a week. I could probably get two emails a week from somebody

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.420
reaching out

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.220
Offering someone to be a guest on the podcast

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.650
I don't get quite that many but I get them myself and to me I gotta go

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.480
Yeah, i'm kind of done with

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.320
With being in a place where you where you just sell your product. Well here

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.320
I don't i'm i'm gonna guess that those people offering, you know

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.040
We would like to have so and so be on your excellent podcast. I'm gonna bet they've never listened to the podcast

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.000
Right it does and you know that just because they call it excellent

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.320
100 yes

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:58.640
And if one of you are listening if you want a chance at pitching a guest to our wonderful contest

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.730
podcast with

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.130
ones of listeners a total of three listeners

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.010
uh, if you want like

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.050
For the love of god i've had like a hundred of these in the past year

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:15.250
Could one of them be not a white dude? We have enough for those on the podcast already

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.470
Every single one

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.260
every single one

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.810
Well, we had

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.770
I mean when we find them ourselves we do better, right?

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.410
We've had like dagnos great. We've had

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:34.530
Yeah, I she should just do the podcast without us she's great. Um, but again, I don't

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.170
Every single one, I can't believe it. I'm just i'm blown away

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:44.770
And so I just ignore them and honestly it's again. I I what I do is I don't delete them

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.160
I forward those requests to our producer

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:53.410
Which is the recycling bin producer is named deleted items

00:39:54.530 --> 00:40:02.610
Delete items folder. Yeah, um deleted folder middle name items. Yeah, that that's where I put those waiting to be processed

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.520
Yeah

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.720
All right

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.880
That is my one little rant for today. Uh patrick hoping answered your questions brent

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.560
Did you have anything else you wanted to cover before we wrap up episode?

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.620
