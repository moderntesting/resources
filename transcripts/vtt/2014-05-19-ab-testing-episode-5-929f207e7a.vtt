00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.740
Hey, I'm Alan.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.440
I'm Brent.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.540
And we're back here for another episode of A B testing

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.040
where Alan and Brent just talk about random crap and see what comes up.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.620
Semi-random crap.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.620
As usual, we have a lean coffee board written up

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.180
and now we begin the process of kind of ignoring it.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.860
No, we're going to slowly work our way through it and get through part of it.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.360
That's the plan.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.460
Yes, we are.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.460
We are on a pretty good schedule.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.720
We had a three week break between podcasts because I went to star East for a week.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.400
So I thought we'd start by I'll give you a little recap, tell you

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.260
some things that happened there if you missed the explosion on my blog.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.560
And I'll see what Brent has to say about all this.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.040
Yes, the so I'd love to start off on the on the the blog that Alan did.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.080
The only problem I see with Alan's blog

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.670
was that I didn't write it.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.610
Oh, Brent.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.270
There's a story behind this blog post.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.370
This wasn't like some plot I had or some like, oh, I want to be controversial.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.410
What happened was I was signed up at star to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.070
give a lightning talk, which are five minute talks.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.610
And they do.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.410
Lee Copeland does lightning strikes the keynotes and everybody gives a five

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.010
minute talk, not everybody.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.770
Eleven of us.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.070
I went there purposely.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.670
If you listen to the last podcast, you know, I didn't have a topic plan.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.810
I didn't have one figured out until we got to the day of the morning

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.930
of the lightning talk.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.930
I was out for a jog and I was thinking about

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.930
everything I had heard so far.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.970
And a lot of people were struggling with their automation.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.570
They're writing a lot of GUI automation and end to end automation.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.710
And they're spending a lot of time investigating failed tests,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.410
thinking about this.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.790
And then I was thinking about what I'm doing at work with,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.990
you know, getting more focused on data.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.490
And I was jogging along and I just stopped.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.990
I thought, well, it's not a heart attack, but I have an idea.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.250
I'm going to do my lightning talk on stop writing automation with two main

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.090
premises.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.810
One is that for the things that automation is really good for short

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.250
confirmatory tests, or as I have been lectured now several times,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.750
I should call those checks.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.650
I'm going to call them short tests because I've, you know, it's,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.610
it's my vocabulary.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.850
Anyway, those short tests, it's so much more efficient and so much more

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.710
applicable to have the developers, the programmers of that code,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.450
write those tests.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.390
So what's left those long tests that we can't maintain.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.950
And to be clear, there are a lot of long tests.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.030
You can even do some sort of end to end scenarios automated at the object

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.850
level versus the GUI or the lower, the better API testing.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.520
Those things can be done quite easily through automation.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.020
Long story short, cause it was only a five minute lightning talk and I'm

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.460
taking longer than that to explain it.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.260
Dev should own the short tests and a lot of the,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.580
a lot of the results testers typically look for in their long tests can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.420
be obtained through customer data and instrumentation.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.260
The only thing I would, I would add to that, and I intend to,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.140
to write a follow up blog post hopefully this weekend, similar to that.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.000
Cause we also in, in the services world,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.380
there is a role for things that feel like test automation.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.420
It is those who, who have heard about tip tests.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.280
In addition to that, I completely agree with what, what Alan is saying regarding

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.320
the traditional way we think of test cases and test automation, right?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.360
Those, those regression checks not only should be done by dev,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.700
they actually dramatically improve devs throughput by dev only.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.560
And they improve code design.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.680
In every case I've seen this people write, when they write testing their own code,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.300
they write better code in the first place.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.320
I actually, so, so my team is undergoing a, a reorg and I was just on a,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.560
on a phone with a dev architect in a different group.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.600
And, and there is a, a rumor going around that,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.000
that we may follow the combined engineering model, which will mean.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.740
I hate that word. I think it's stupid.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.770
Yeah. Great.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.370
I don't care about, I don't, the point is, and we're going to,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.290
no, you, you don't like it because it, it, you,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.030
you want to get rid of this, this,

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.190
we're all just engineers is kind of what I think you'll say to them.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.310
Yeah. I think with special, I believe in God,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.710
it is a generalizing specialists.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.170
And I think that you want to build a good team with a lot of specialties and I

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.270
will always be a test specialist and I don't care what you call me.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.230
It doesn't matter,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.830
but don't put me on a team where you call it combined engineering.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.950
That it's like you're trying too hard. Just anyway,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.150
I don't know if that. So I,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.730
I don't know if they'll frame it as combined engineering.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.290
It just pushes a button with me.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.590
I really think titles are going away at Microsoft at least at some point,

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.930
but anyway, go on. Sorry. I agree. The, anyway, the,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.090
I don't think I've mentioned this. Maybe I have.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.210
So I spent the majority of my career as a middle manager in test. Uh,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.650
here at Microsoft, we call that a test manager role. Also called the loser.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.610
Go on. Yes. Uh, or, or, or meeting a tender. Um,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.300
I then shifted into a dev role where I did not have any testers at all.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.760
And one of the things that that forced me to do is of course,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.620
in order to, to ship quality software,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.620
I had to have my guys owning their own testing and we didn't want to do the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.520
full on test process where you test passes and,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.920
and all of that sort of thing. Uh, so we, we kind of did it,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.980
adually and figured out, well, what,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.260
how exact much of testing we needed to do. So we, uh, we,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.540
we learned very quickly,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.540
I've been a picker in terms of words to you.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.420
You learned the exact amount of testing you needed to do.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.190
We, we were constantly learning that. Okay.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.910
But it was iterative. So what I was about to say is that like, for example,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.950
first time, uh, we have a principle of we shipped straight to prod.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.950
So there is maybe hours latency between check-in and it's,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.210
it's live what the team discovered very quickly is that we had insufficient

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.230
testing because the, we constantly, once we checked in,

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.230
we constantly had to revert and thankfully we had the signals in place to know

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.830
when we had to revert. Uh,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.910
but that reversion process caused friction caused annoyance on the team and

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.990
what ended up happening is each of the guys learned very quickly.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.710
What checks they needed to put in place.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.770
It also caused learning, right? That's the big point. And that's, you know,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.290
I heard so many people, I gave this talk and then, um,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.610
took out the blog post in a second. I gave this talk. It's like, well,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.770
that won't work at our, we have a mission critical it app people use for

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.200
expenses. And I go, you know what? That's a good spot for it.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.880
And the guy at the bank says, this is a bank. We can't do it here.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.960
And I just, it was your aside, you know, he's talking,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.200
he's doing like, um, if your application is maybe you have some comments on

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.200
this, but I conceded when your whole application is helping traders make trades,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.420
um, in real time, I think you want to be a little bit more careful,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.120
but just generally being a bank, you can say, well, we have to have accounts.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.200
Right? Yes, you do.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.940
But if you are a bank and you are not AB testing that credit card offer on

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.620
your homepage, you are screwing up. Yeah. And if you're not clear, uh,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.260
what AB testing kind of means in this context,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.040
that's right. We have two AB testing. We have Alan Brent,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.400
and then we have controlled experiments. Right. Now, one of the,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.320
one of the, the, the processes in AB testing typically is it's not an all or

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.960
nothing. So when we say we shipped a prod,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.260
we don't light it up for the entire world. We, we,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.280
we mitigate risk by lighting it up to a small number of people,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.840
the number of people that if we do screw over, uh,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.740
we have the ability to reach out and, and personally

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.860
engage and repair that issue. Like if you light up to the whole world and you

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.420
negatively impact millions of people, your team cannot scale.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.340
Yeah. And that's the really,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.420
that's the really important thing that, um, I forgot, you know,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.940
I sort of in my head is taking for granted,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.620
but I forgot to mention is that when you roll out these things to and get data

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.580
from real customers, you, when you're rolling out changes,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.180
you're doing it to a very small audience versus like 1% or less first.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.880
And then then the concentric circles growing with monitors in

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.880
place to let you know the second things, whether it's perf, whether it's,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.160
you know, disk space, if something's CPU, if something's going, not as expected,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.640
you can immediately stop and roll back or roll forward depending on the product.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.000
Yes. So back to the, how, how it worked on my last team.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.000
So my, my guys got really irritated with this and I made it very clear.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.380
I will not be looking for testers. So you guys need to figure it out.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.220
And I offered, you know, more actionable suggestions to that,

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.400
but I, I, I primarily empowered them to work through it.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.980
And what I discovered is on their own, nice on their own,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.460
uh, they, what they did is they realized first and foremost,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.300
in order to do this,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.540
they need to get the right set of checks in place to,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.800
to manage what they now have learned is things that can cause the service to

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.800
go down. And then what they did is they realized that their code wasn't built for

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.340
testability concerns. So they ended up refactoring their code.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.820
And as they refactored their code in reducing coupling between objects and,

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.980
and making objects much more cohesive,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.460
turns out we found out that it was a lot easier to add new features because

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.540
things, the, the overall complexity of the system had dramatically reduced.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.520
That's a really critical thing. Not, you know,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.760
it's not just more efficient, touching this before,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.020
but that's more efficient for developers to write their, their,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.080
their short test for those things. But it has such an impact on code quality.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.520
They were, they realized right away, oh crap, I can't test this code.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.920
There's no way. And they, and they, the code is designed so much better. It's,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.120
it's, I'm really excited. It's a little fantastic.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.280
The, the current model that we do where,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.400
where there's this,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.660
this awkward segmentation between dev and a handoff over to, to test.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.220
What this does is it,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.220
it optimizes for the maximization of costs to produce crap quality.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.220
So, so in addition to, to the code quality going down,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.660
because the code quality is now more isolated,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.900
the need for additional tests or checks also goes down.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.200
Absolutely.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.140
You'd no longer have to create this,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.780
this huge bank of end to end automation because the

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.220
system is so put together and so complex that you really have no freaking clue

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.500
which of these test cases could fail and win.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.810
Correct. So back to the original subject quickly, we'll get,

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.490
one more thing and then remind me that we were talking about something else.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.870
Automation. So the, the other thing I would say, you mentioned, Hey,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.930
this is the type of automation we should have.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.550
The one thing that I don't, I wonder where you will put it in.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.910
Cause in my way of thinking, uh,

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.470
we will need synthetic simulation.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.650
We talked about this in the past and I do think this is,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.690
this is code that sounds and feels like automation from the old school way,

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.470
but it differs in that I don't give a f*** if this automation

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.630
contains validation code.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.390
All I wanted to do is drive synthetic simulation against the product.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.130
Yeah. And for, um, I don't have talked about synthetics before in the past,

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.410
but that's kind of what we did in testing for a long, long time. It's,

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.370
it's a bunch of it's code to or data to pretend you're the user.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.360
Yes. So I was getting ready for this. Uh,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.010
I decided what I was going to do for my, uh, star keynote, uh,

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.660
start the lightning talk and Brent is touching my coffee.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:24.240
Brent don't touch my coffee and I was getting it together in my

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.460
head and I think I, it was the same day. I did a, uh, uh,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.540
interview for sticky minds. I'll, I'll plug it when it's ever was published.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.220
And I'm thinking about it all day and I'm trying to get it in my head.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.220
I think about writing some notes out and I go, you know what?

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.980
I am just going to stream of consciousness, blog,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.580
my lightning talk.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.980
And I ended up making some slides and putting the pictures in the blog post.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.200
And it was literally, I wrote that post in 15,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.120
maybe 20 minutes, threw it up there,

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.470
did the lightning talk. And then I doubled the,

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.350
the I have my old record for the most hits on my blog in a day.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.230
And I doubled that in four of the next five days. As people tell me,

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.550
some people said, Oh yeah, we do this all the time.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.710
But most people said, you are a flaming idiot. You have,

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.550
one person told me posts like this are annoying.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.870
You should let the testing profession have the credit it deserves.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.970
I'm not taking anything away from testing.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.390
This is not just for Microsoft,

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.870
how we do it at Microsoft and almost every team,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.830
but how a lot of big companies, especially with services do things.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.750
It's not, it's not,

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.670
I'm not like describing the future or some hypothetical thing.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.870
There are companies already doing this stuff.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.550
When I get similar guidance of not giving tests,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.230
the credit that is due, I make it very clear. Look,

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:52.210
this stuff in the, in, in the world that we exited 10

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.210
years ago, by the way, this stuff in the world that we exit,

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.730
it was hugely valuable.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.330
But we didn't exit it because in the star expo,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.850
there were like a dozen vendors selling GUI automation tools.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.910
I would say modern testing techniques

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.190
changed around 10 years ago and

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:21.810
testing companies, testing institutions, maybe that's a better word.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.810
They haven't really caught suit, including here.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.530
It takes time. I found a GTAC talk. Maybe I can't remember who pointed this to me.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.170
A GTAC talk from 2007.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.350
That's seven years ago for those of you counting.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.960
And the statement in the talk was monitoring,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.160
monitoring services is indistinguishable from test automation.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.030
Brent made a face. So it's a little bit of a stretch.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.610
And I probably script the paraphrasing,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.530
but he's talking about these exact same things.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:53.330
There's definitely a mapping is very similar. The, the,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.370
when you first start off, it's, it's almost verbatim test cases against prod,

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.130
right? It's, it's testing in production.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.250
But over time, as you get the right data exhaust,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.170
then you,

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.170
you end up building towards leveraging more of the exhaust and actual product or

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.870
customer traffic. Then the signals generated from these synthetics.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.790
So one of the processes that I see very common is once that flows,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.390
people then start building muscle around, okay, which of these tests can we shut

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.590
off? Because typically what happens is these,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.330
these monitors get put in play and when they fail,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.030
they wake somebody up and that generally perceived as annoying.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.470
Got it. Got it. All right. We've, we've beat on that a little bit.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.790
So we skipped over the first one.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.280
Well it's because that's your fault.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.960
Yeah. I, I, I, and I would do it again. All right. Just star in general.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.810
It's a conference is growing.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.850
I can't remember how many stars I've been to at this point.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.090
It was a good time. It's, it's a, it's a weird crowd.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.430
Probably half the crowd has been testing for less than a year.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.010
And most of the speakers are consultants trying to drum up business.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.530
I sort of inferred that second part, but most of the other consultants and

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.650
nothing against consultants. And this is a great place to drum up business.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.410
But they're drumming up business from people that haven't been testing very

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.650
long. Take that for what it is. And as I mentioned before,

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.610
a bunch of vendors selling, uh, trying to sell GUI automation tools,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.690
but there were some cool vendors or two sauce labs. They are really like them.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.890
Smart bear was there. Smart bear does some really cool stuff.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.290
If you, you know, smart bear software, the first,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.890
my first exposure to smart bear,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.210
this is like their flagship legacy old product is code collaborator,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.770
which is a fantastic code review tool.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.210
Really good for capturing comments and lie and keeping them and,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:46.100
and in a variety of different formats and sort of takes all the best things

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.580
from all the different forms of code review and puts them into one tool.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.220
That wasn't even a paid plug, but I was a big fan of that.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.580
And now they make a bunch of other testing tools as well. And,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.660
and Scott Barber, I'm off on a random topic, but anyway,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.820
big fan of smart bear and I'll shut up there.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.540
So Scott was there at then Scott Barber was there. Yeah. I'm, I'm a,

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.240
I'm a fan of Scott. Um, and I didn't mention this last time.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.660
Like I'm a huge fan of, of leak Copeland.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.280
I think he's done a great job in terms of sort of curating the history

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.120
of, of test and what's value in that. I am curious. I haven't,

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.720
I haven't followed him recently.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.960
Is he staying in sync with sort of modern testing techniques from your point of

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.840
view? You know, it's honestly, as much as we rant about it,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm not sure what modern test techniques are, if I could describe them,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.240
but I can say dropping test automation would be an example.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.160
I think if you don't think test is changing drastically, I think, you know,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.000
there's a lot of people out there stuck in 1990s testing and they're really

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.960
good at 1990s testing. And guess what?

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.700
There's still software being made like it's 1990 and all that's great.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.720
I think, uh, at least for the star conference is somewhere in between.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.480
You're starting to see the audience is a lot more technical.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.590
So this is a period generalization,

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.590
but I would say I've seen star grow. It's sort of lagging, you know,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.930
some of the industry leaders, but they are growing.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:15.370
There were a lot of talks on forgive me father test automation and some more

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.890
technical topics. Alan Richardson,

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.890
Missouri gave a tutorial on selenium so that people get testers writing code,

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.890
a lot of testers and a lot of, you know, S debt type testers know how to code.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.170
Whereas even five years ago, in fact, it was probably five,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:35.170
six years ago, somewhere back there, I gave a talk and as part of the talk,

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.660
I showed some code and people got up and walked out. It's like, ah,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.620
I won the code. I go to a programming conference.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.060
Interesting. So what you're seeing,

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.140
so in old school Microsoft vernacular,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.580
those types of testers we used to call STEs and are you,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.740
are you seeing there's a shift.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.780
There's a shift from the tester to the tester who can code whatever you call

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.000
them. I, you know, from the moment it was introduced,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.300
I didn't like the S debt title, but a tester who can code.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.040
So I wonder,

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.640
do you guys have access to the title of the attendees?

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.440
Cause I'm wondering if actually if what you,

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.420
what we're beginning to see is actually people who are actually developers who

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.160
are trying to enhance their skillset.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.640
I don't know if we have that Lee may have access,

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.300
but the thing is titles mean nothing.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.520
They don't mean nothing. They mean something. It may be fuzzy.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.570
No, they mean nothing. No, they mean nothing.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.510
Nothing. Nothing. If you look, you're, you know,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.750
I have a four year old Alan. I could do this all day.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.340
Nothing. Something. All right.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.780
So anyway,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.460
all I'll say that I can from my observations that I talked to,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.540
I didn't manage to talk to every single person at star.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.900
I talked to 20 or 30 and most of those were not every single person at star.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.700
No, there's about 700. Don't be a dick.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.400
Anyway, a lot more recoding. I talked to really interesting. I talked to,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.280
I'm going to leave all anonymize this.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.000
I talked to a few people who work at a company and they're telling me is you're

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.800
going to love this story. I didn't, didn't prepare Brent on this one.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.560
They were telling me that about their command and control managers.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.040
And I was giving a talk about software engineers are knowledge workers and

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.460
they can't be managed in the same way.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.280
And they had very much these command and controls. How do you work within that?

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.900
And I have some,

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.860
I have some good ideas because we have a very not command and control org living

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.680
within a larger command and control org in my head.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.300
After talking about, about their managers, I say, man,

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.860
these guys sound just like some of the,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.700
the old school managers I've worked with who have a way they want to do things

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.220
and want to micromanage, et cetera.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.780
Then they dropped the bomb that their managers were former Microsoft managers.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:00.340
Yep. And, and to be fair, I, I've been talking a lot.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.440
I think we might've talked about this before, but people, um,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.160
I think people,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.500
it's really easy to rely on your past to bring you forward. And you're thinking,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.480
I spent 15 years, you know,

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.840
managing people this way and I got promoted and so they hired me because of my

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.160
background. So I should do things the exact same way.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.560
Yeah. So it's interesting because about 10 years ago,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.940
I was frustrated with that aspect that we were losing some, some,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.720
some of our management talent to other companies.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.740
But what now occurs to me is it actually might be a competitive advantage for

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.580
Microsoft.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.900
I didn't like the way you use talent in that sentence.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.860
Fair enough. The, the,

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.340
it's interesting because I have seen that a lot of our old,

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.850
10 years ago, we were way more command and control than we are today.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.050
And a lot of the old talent is now in my view,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.080
corrupting our competitors. And I'm like, okay.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.220
It was very interesting. Um, in the,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.540
I'm going to skip that one because I think it's leads right into number four.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.220
Okay. I, on Friday of star East week, uh,

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.660
there's a smaller summit. Um, hundred people ish,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.140
I gave a keynote there and sort of serendipitously what happened that week at

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.220
work is I was thinking a lot about our team culture and what made my current

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.980
team a great place to work. So I,

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.740
I sketched out some of our principles and our, and the values.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.860
I'll talk about what those mean in a second. And I was,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.700
it was going to bounce those off our team. And they said,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.480
this is exactly what we're doing and how we want them written down.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.320
So this is great.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.680
The one thing I want to stress is that when you're trying to,

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.220
I tweeted this yesterday and, and I'll repeat it again, paraphrase, is that,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.380
I think a lot of software teams undervalue how important it is to have a good

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.180
team culture. And in order to make great software, he had a great team.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.820
And I think too often going back to command and control,

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.960
we think we don't need a great team. You know, people are just, you know,

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.780
they're like cogs.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.760
We were a place and we'll just,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.120
as long as they keep turning the crank,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.120
the right thing will happen at the end. And it doesn't really work that way.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.060
Some of the ways that,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.620
unless you view the right thing that happened at the end is everyone's working

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.700
30 hour days and producing crap.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.560
Exactly. Exactly. 30 hour days are good.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.900
So one of the things that I've found,

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.540
and I've read this a lot like in Pat Legione's work and that I found is

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.280
being ultra transparent in,

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.860
as a leadership team,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.860
what you care about is probably the biggest step in my experience

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.860
for helping, helping build that strong team culture. Nobody likes, you know,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.980
I talked about surprises at review time and nobody wants the mushroom concept.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.140
I can't remember what it means anymore,

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.380
but people don't want to be in the dark on things.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.100
And if you let them know everything, like here's how we function,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.720
how we expect you to work and over communicate that over communicate that

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.320
because everybody on the same page and it does amazing things for team.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.610
There's a risk with over communication. And if you over communicate, then,

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.730
then everyone understands that these are the words that we want everyone to

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.890
follow. But if you don't follow it up with action from the leadership,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.770
then they will bit flip.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.770
Then the next step is you over communicate and then you praise

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.150
and reward people who, who show examples of following those principles or values.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.390
Yes. And that you don't have to like, you know,

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.830
John followed principle number two very well.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.390
He gets a hundred dollars and a gift certificate to target. Thank you.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.670
Thanks to, uh, to Wendy, she did a fantastic job working with others.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.470
You know, we really value that on the team. Um,

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.510
so it's a great example for others. And that's just that public praise is

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.270
massive because, Oh, I want to be praised too. I'm going to do those things.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.970
Well, there's other ones, right?

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.350
Not everyone's not anyone, not everyone's motivated by public praise,

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.190
but for example, for me,

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:58.630
I will do those types of things because I want to accelerate towards the goal.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.350
And I would try to measure my acceleration towards those goals.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.110
You're reading my mind on this, uh, this talk I gave. No, it's really good. Um,

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.230
I spoke a lot about the knowledge worker. It's been a lot of writing about

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.470
this. You know, Dan pink wrote about it first in a whole new mind and then a

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.110
little bit more in drive and in drive,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.730
but perfectly logical point. When you think about it,

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.290
knowledge workers are motivated by progress, pay them enough money.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.130
So money's off the table. And then if you give them the tools and frameworks

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.010
they need and they can, they can see progress happening,

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.530
they get excited and want to make more.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:28.970
And that sounds very much like what you said.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.730
So to follow up earlier, you were just talking about the,

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.530
the smart bear project, sure. Uh, along the lines of,

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.890
as well as you talked about command and control.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.730
And one of the things that I found is right.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.790
Command and control is a decision making framework. It's,

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.710
they wait for data to bubble up to them.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.710
And then they add their experience and expertise and bubble data down

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.150
in this new world. The easiest way you can defeat command and control,

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:03.280
even if you are deeply entrenched in command and control is

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.840
increase the rate of knowledge at the lowest level.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.440
So, so creating a good shared knowledge management strategy,

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.720
whereas the guys at the bottom have all this knowledge and all this data,

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.740
and they're very quickly making decisions. You will blow the stack.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.020
This guy at the top will not be able to scale.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.820
I also talked about decentralization and the work of Steve Denning,

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.960
who says that in leaders guide to radical management says that for knowledge

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.540
workers, give them a framework to work in and then get out of their way,

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.960
let them self-organize into teams, let them figure things out.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.420
But the key insight that I would say here,

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.780
and I'll let you finish your train of thought is knowledge

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.340
management as an important technology

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.490
is something that is more and more becoming evident as

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:01.330
critical in this new world order. The, I think a lot of people are like,

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.850
what? I wrote a doc, it's up on SharePoint someplace. Go, go, go search. No,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.830
that doesn't help creating,

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.910
creating something like like we have with Yammer,

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.950
something that allows people in this, this, this,

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:21.070
I forget the name of the code bear, smart bear, smart bear. Yeah. No, the,

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.390
but the project where a co collaborator co collaborator where they're

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.510
capturing shared knowledge in the context of the code,

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.390
those types of things accelerate the people who will be actually taking

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.770
action and negates the need for every decision to flow up.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.800
So now you have Phillip armors, five orders of ignorance.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.840
I'm not going to go through them all,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.660
but we need to provide the top levels when you know about the order.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.560
So you know how knowledge acquisition works,

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.680
but the level below that is you need a suitable means to discover what you

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.920
don't know. You don't know. Yes. And Alan has a phrase he uses here at

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.920
Microsoft and I have been finding that,

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.220
that I am repeating this phrase over and over again in my own conversations.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.900
And I've also found that I continue to feel

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:14.380
rather dirty every time I use the phrase because it's one of the few things

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.860
I've noticed from Alan that is terribly smart.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.660
And that is, and that is if only Microsoft knew what Microsoft knew,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.240
there are numerous times I sit in my office and I'm now sitting at my desk and I

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.600
know I am solving a problem right now that someone,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.200
someone somewhere else in this company has already solved,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.880
mastered and optimized it.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.920
But the reason why I am solving this problem right now is I have no clue how

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.080
to find that guy. Well, yeah. Um, I have a, um,

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.680
I have a thinking about it.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.980
Yeah. Um, I have a, um,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.300
I have a thank week paper I never finished and I probably never finished it

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.100
about it's called if only Microsoft knew what Microsoft knew.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.400
And the idea is that I think at this stage and maybe it's getting better.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.340
Um, it's hard to tell cause things are so incremental with such a large

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.340
company, but right now I would say Microsoft size is sort of slowing them

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.780
down. And I think Microsoft size,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.980
if there was a suitable means for people to discover what they didn't know,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.660
it takes a while to get there that we could use our size as a serious

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.140
competitive advantage. If we had so much mindshare here,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.200
yet if we had a really efficient means for capturing and sharing knowledge,

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.160
we would, we would destroy our competition. If we just had that,

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.000
but because it's an indirect asset, who knows when that's going to get funded?

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.920
Yeah. I'm just going to book drop all over the place.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.340
Peter Singar wrote a book called the fifth discipline about the learning

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.300
organization about, um, and that's one of the, the bits of one of the

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.900
principles for our team is that for my team and our principles, I wrote,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.220
we are a learning organization and we strive for continuous improvement.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.820
We realize that failure is an option and that making mistakes is part of

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.980
learning. That's so we five principles. And one of them is, you know,

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.940
we're going to try things out and if they don't work,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.620
we're going to say awesome job trying that out. Try something else.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.560
I have it when usually I give this type of speech, I simplify it.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.640
And I said, in order to learn, you must fail.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.510
You don't learn from succeeding. No. Um, anyway,

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.670
I had a good time giving that talk.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:31.170
It made me think a lot about sort of our own team and reflect on that a lot.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:35.710
So I'm really, there's some good stuff going on to, uh, recap,

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.750
figure out what you care about on culture on your team and make sure

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.000
everyone on the team knows. Yeah. So I,

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.060
do you think you could publish your principles?

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.180
You know, I think I could, I showed them at the conference.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.980
I could probably publish them. Do you want me to go through them quickly? Yeah,

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.760
sure. So the principles are the organizations, teams,

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.220
and disciplines don't define the limits of what we do.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.740
Our team members will feel free to work across the quality team boundaries,

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.260
take on dev work as needed and represent their own work as a project owner

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.060
when necessary. So we're not worried about walls. In other words,

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.580
tear down the walls. We don't have, you know, we don't let walls between,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.340
oh, that's not my job. It's your job. Get in the way.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.390
Something needs to get done. You get it done. Yes.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.910
We have a culture of innovation and we embrace positive deviance.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:18.750
You familiar with that term?

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.240
So positive deviance is when you have individuals or groups whose uncommon

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.160
behaviors and strategies enable them to find better solutions.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.680
So we're looking for people to try to try different.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.680
So risk takers, innovators, that sort of thing. Yeah. Okay. Everyone,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.120
and this is actually the thing I'm most proud of on our team is everyone on

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.400
our team has meaningful work that aligns with their passions and expertise.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.060
We've been able to poach and cherry pick a little bit on this team.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.940
So we've been able to kind of fit pieces together and people are super excited

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.380
about what they do. That's critical. We don't want people, again,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.820
goes back to Daniel Pink's work is that if you like your work and you make

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.100
progress, you're just going to do more of it. Yeah.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:00.350
And then we're open and transparent about what is going well and where we need

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.230
to improve. And this principle is multi-directional.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.950
It's true across the team from individual contributors to leadership and from

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:11.120
leadership back to individual contributors. Yep. We share everything. And I

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.180
mentioned we're a learning organization and we strive for continuous improvement,

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.720
failure is an option, making mistakes as part of learning. And then the last one,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.040
unlike the others, but very important in how we approach,

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.160
this is all the how we approach our job.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.880
The best place to evaluate customer experiences is in production.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.550
We will push our components to real users as frequently as possible.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.270
It's a little bit different, but it's still part of the how. So we...

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:39.450
Yeah. I don't like the best place. I mean, I completely agree with it,

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.990
but it implies that there's other places that you could...

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.710
You want me to change this to the only place?

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:49.070
The only valuable place. If you evaluate. Yeah.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.350
And the other thing, just to tack onto that,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.110
that we're really transparent about is any company has a,

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.670
some sort of review system, whether it's the,

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.870
the evil stack rank or something else.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.510
And we want people to know, you know, I say no surprises at review time.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.870
We want our team to know exactly how they're being rewarded,

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.330
what we care about. And it's very simple list. It's, um,

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:16.070
we value output. Our team gets a lot of work done. We also,

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.470
that not blind output.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:22.210
We also value business and customer impact that the output directly impacts our

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.670
business and customers. So it's really pot. You can, you, you,

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.510
you've seen, you know,

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.990
examples of people who are really busy doing a lot of stuff,

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:33.560
but it's not relevant stuff. And that's not, that's not valuable.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.780
Back at again, re-emphasizing innovation and experiments.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.680
We experiment with new ideas, tools, customer experiments, et cetera.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.600
We're, we're, we're, we're experimenters. We're trying new things out. And then,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.840
an obvious one, collaboration,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.160
our team works together and supports and helps each other to be successful.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.920
So when we're looking at, when we're having rewards discussions, you know,

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.720
we're having discussions about Brett, what, what Brent did,

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.920
how his work impacted the customer,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.240
what new ideas he brought to the team in order to get a lot of ideas,

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.300
good ideas. You get a lot of ideas and throw the bad ones away.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.580
So we need lots of people bringing in ideas.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.180
I need you to work well with others and help others better,

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.180
especially for our more senior people.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.220
We expect that you're doing significant work to help make those around you

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.010
better. Yeah. I had a discussion, uh,

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:28.310
recently with, with one of my mentees and it was interesting cause he was

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.610
trying to put together a Brownback and he's like,

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:34.090
he put together one and he talked through it.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:39.550
And he noticed that people weren't really reacting to it.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.890
And it was interesting, but I'll, I'll cut the story very short.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.330
But at the end of that event,

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:49.690
one of the things I made it very clear is that there is an important

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.750
distinction between teaching and learning.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.020
Yeah. Right. Just because you're standing up and teaching people doesn't mean

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:02.460
that they're learning and make sure that the goal that you have is the

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.490
right one. If your goal is to teach, great, you did it,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.550
but it non-trivial chance, zero impact.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.510
The all you gotta do is say, no, teaching is a means.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.440
How do I get these guys to learn? Right. But he,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.120
he had approached it as that more of a teaching exercise.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.730
How could I tell them what I know? Is that closer?

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.410
How can I get what I know stuck between their ears?

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.850
Yeah. You got to think about learning objectives and what,

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.790
what you want them to get out of it and focus on those. It's a, it's a,

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.510
it's a difficult art. Yeah. I think it's a lot,

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.390
a lot of room for learning and making mistakes here.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.790
I've realized looking at the clock in our list that we're not going to get very

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.350
much farther. So I'm going to share one little bit of,

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.990
uh, mail I received and just keep your reaction on it. And then, um,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.790
I hear that you have a mail bag reaction. We'll get to that. We'll close.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:02.130
Yeah. So where's the, uh, the, the new mail bag theme? Oh, wait.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.870
Okay.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:10.150
Excellent. This is rapidly becoming my favorite part of the discussion.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:15.070
All right. So the first one is I saw a mail, uh,

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:19.350
recently with someone talking about planning and just some,

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.350
some work the team had to do.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.130
And then the last two paragraphs I thought were really interesting where the

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:30.160
manager in question felt the need to, uh,

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.800
take two paragraphs to explain we are not waterfall.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.540
We are not waterfall and explain and start starting to justify nothing above was

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.340
really too waterfallish,

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.720
but I thought it was interesting that the manager felt the need to spell out to

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.300
the team that we are not waterfall.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.220
So there's nothing above it that was really waterfallish. Not really. I think there's,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.660
why do you think he, he felt,

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.460
there's gotta be other motivation there. Yeah. But whenever I see,

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.840
and in general,

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.040
when I see people defend whatever they're doing is not waterfall, like waterfall,

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.600
like, you know, waterfall is the evil death and we're not that you need to look

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.580
at what you're doing and think, and really think deeper about, you know,

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.240
what are you doing? It, it, I mean,

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.500
it does come across the way you've tell the story. It comes across as a,

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.000
as a defensive rationalization.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.880
I think someone may have like talked to him offline and that showed its way

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.720
in there,

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.820
but I think it also falls into that trap that people think that waterfall and

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.800
agile are a dichotomy and they're not opposites on the end of the scale.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.880
Brent's about to go into a rat hole here. No. So the problem is,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.280
so I agree with what you're saying.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.200
The problem is,

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.840
is that at least in the context that you're referring to both waterfall and

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.640
agile are dramatically overloaded. The people you,

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.380
absolutely people using these terms, uh,

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.060
know what it means in terms of the culture that they're used to,

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.140
but they don't know what it means in terms of like the, the,

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.900
the data that you have and due to the investigations in the research you have,

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.280
like I can't tell you the number of people I've talked to that says,

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.060
I hate agile.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:21.840
And it's primarily because they see it as totally slow and

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.460
inefficient and, and it really, when you look at it, it's what,

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:31.500
what has happened is they have taken the waterfall process and applied two week

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.890
sprints to it. So they're merely iterative. They're very merely iterative,

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:42.310
but the, the, the heavyweight big design upfront model that,

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.890
that often typifies, uh,

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:50.890
I'll double quote it the waterfall process that that still,

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:54.390
uh, part of their new agile team.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:58.550
So you spend 13 weeks building, building,

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:03.390
no 13 weeks. So people will do one month long, um,

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.250
agile milestones,

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:11.070
spend a week and a half building doing all of their design work upfront,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:16.530
a week doing coding and then a week running around like headless chickens.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.170
Little sprinter fall. Yeah. And they,

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:23.750
it's basically they're trying to shorten the cycle,

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.660
the iterative cycle and they're not getting it right.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.020
It's a big part of, of, of agile that,

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.820
that really makes things efficient because you don't try to boil the ocean.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:41.020
You try to go find the coldest part of the ocean, make it warm that up,

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.900
and then figure out how to keep it warm so then you can go find the next

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.020
coldest part of the ocean.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.600
I guess the important thing that often missed is the value of constant learning

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.520
and adapting that comes with that. You want to learn as much,

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.960
do you want to be a learning organization?

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.240
Like a good agile organization is a good learning organization,

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.600
not that other organizations can't be learning,

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.680
but sort of built into the process.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:08.160
I was on a Twitter discussion recently and it was a

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.600
bunch of people, uh,

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.400
venting about how, how the learning loop is important to agile.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.900
And, uh, one of the,

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.500
one of the stories that I shared on that is the,

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.500
if you go to the dictionary and look up what agile means, it's,

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.500
it says to move quickly. And so people interpret this as, oh, well,

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.460
we're agile, so we got to go as fast as possible. And, and I said, no,

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.940
okay. This is false.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.980
That the definition in terms of how we need to use it is not correct.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.400
You go look at, uh, what was the champion, uh,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.720
four 40 runner in the last summer Olympics, the, the, I forget his name.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.960
Yeah, go on. We'll call him that guy.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.720
So that guy is really fast,

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.740
but they don't call him agile. They call him fast, right?

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.160
Agile is the ability to move quickly in a new direction.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.540
Ninjas are agile. I throw something at a ninja.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.240
He gets out of the way pretty damn quickly.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.480
It's always a great podcast. We can bring ninjas into the mix. Yeah.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.720
I was trying to quickly think, is there a way to do pirates? Uh, but no, I can't.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.200
That's all right. Yeah. Arr there. Um,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.840
so agile is about changing direction quickly.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.240
And if it's about changing direction quickly,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.960
then you need to know the direction you were heading.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.400
You need to know the new direction.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.720
Both of these are often guided by goals.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.680
And in order to establish the new direction,

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.960
you need the ability to learn quickly.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.650
Yes. You know, when I saw that mail,

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:52.010
it's like little red flag in my head. And I thought there's more, one,

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.970
there's more going on here, but two, you don't need to be defensive. I just,

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:56.330
you know,

00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:00.650
I think you want to make software based on the context of your team and your

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.610
customer and,

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.890
and all kinds of other things in the most efficient way possible that often that's,

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:10.190
very agile or as I heard it called in a meeting a few weeks ago, super agile.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:14.110
This guy, I've still, it reminds me of slow drill.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:16.750
I still want to buy a term and I use it. Um,

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:22.470
this guy, he would have done a better job instead of arguing why he's not

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:28.300
waterfall, uh, arguing, or maybe not even arguing,

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.700
but instead of saying what we aren't, he should have said what we are.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.260
Yes. Uh,

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.600
notice the principles I gave for our, for our team.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.320
None of them says what we don't do. It's all about what we do. Right.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.160
Jensen's number one rule of politics.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.660
He who is defensive loses always.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.420
You cannot win any game,

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.860
any competition by playing defense only.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:01.400
And when you start up a team who is with a framing that is defensive in

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.540
nature, that will permeate throughout the team culture. I,

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.740
my advice to you would be to go talk to that guy and get him to do a follow up

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.040
and say, by the way, I've gotten some, some guidance.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.240
I want to be also clear. This is what we are.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.980
Yeah, that's good. That's good. So, um, we got a closer,

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.100
but Brent, you had a little personal touch on the mail bag. Yeah.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.100
So I have a mail bag story as well. Um,

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.920
so last time we, we spent some, some time talking about,

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.040
uh, my son and he, he, he told me,

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.400
Hey dad, I have a mail bag item for you.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.430
I want you to let, uh, Mr. Page know that yes,

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:54.200
it is true. It is because of him that I'm following this podcast.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.120
That's excellent news. That's great. That half of our listeners,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.140
um, at least are following just me only. Yes. So I, I, uh,

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.220
two, two, two thoughts. Very cool. Number one. Yes.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:11.220
I have a confirmed listener and number two stupid teenagers.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.760
All right. We're going to get kicked out of our rooms. We're going to take off.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.840
So I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we'll see you next time. Thank you. Bye.
