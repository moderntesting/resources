WEBVTT

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.920
Hey everybody, I'm Alan.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920
And I'm Brent.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.040
And we're here for episode four of A-B testing,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.080
because you couldn't get enough of the first three.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.080
We're back here again.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.800
And we're already at episode four.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.120
Very, very soon we're going to get to the point

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.720
where I can no longer count that high.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.240
I know.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.440
I know.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.000
What are we going to do?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.280
We're going to.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.480
Oh, you know what we should have done?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.840
It's too late now.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.260
We should have counted all of our episodes in binary.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.100
No?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.300
I have a on my floor mat in front of my office downstairs,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.780
I have a welcome mat.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.500
And it's the word welcome written in binary.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.180
And people stare at it.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.940
And they go, what?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.400
ASCII or Unicode?

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.280
The leading zeros aren't in place.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
So they are 8-bit values.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.800
You have to count, because the welcome map doesn't

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.880
wrap on 8-bit boundaries.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.480
So you have to look kind of closely.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.880
You have to notice that there's 15 characters in the first line.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.360
But it doesn't take a lot of knowledge to go, OK.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.400
There's a pattern here.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.880
If I break these into 8 bits, I can find the pattern.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.840
I go, OK, it all starts.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.080
They're all kind of the same.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.960
And most people, without even having binary code memorized,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.960
I shouldn't say most.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.360
A lot of people can figure it out.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.680
They kind of stare at it for a while, look at me, and go,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.880
is that a welcome mat?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280
I said, of course it's a welcome mat.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.800
What else do you think it is?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800
It's interesting, given the context

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.920
of where you have that thing, and that's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.760
at your office at Microsoft, that people don't get the binary code.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.240
The funny thing is sometimes somebody will mess with me

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.080
and turn it upside down.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.680
Does that make it an unwelcome mat?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.480
Well, it makes it just asky gibberish.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.680
Whoa!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.280
Yeah, I know.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.320
I wonder, as an experiment, can you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.040
get the hexadecimal version and see

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.320
if people get that one sooner?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.920
I could.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.240
I think we're off track.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.160
No, actually, the theme of this podcast

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.080
is to not be ever on track.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.840
And we do that famously.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.880
So we decided that this is something

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880
that we're good at, and we're just

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.360
going to measure our ability to produce this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.640
by what we're good at.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.240
Yes, we are.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.420
So we do have, we practice sort of lean coffee sort

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.100
of approach here.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.820
We have a list of topics that we kind of dot voted.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.420
But dot voting doesn't really work when you have two people.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.820
So I choose which order we go in,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.660
and Brent patassively agrees.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.100
So the first thing I want to talk about is,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.100
I don't think we're going to get another recording in before I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.900
head off to the Star East Conference in Orlando.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.820
So I have little heads up for in the weird.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.220
You know what I'm going to do?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.180
I am going to promote this.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.140
I'm going to put a link to this podcast in my slides,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.020
and maybe we'll gain a listener.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.820
Oh, wow.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.860
That'd be fantastic.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.140
Maybe we'll lose a few.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.380
So it's interesting.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.300
So you're doing Star East.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.220
Yes.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.220
I do it all week.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.580
I'm like a traveling road show for the whole week.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.140
And is this primarily to get a free trip to Disneyland?

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.980
Disney World.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.180
No, you know, here's the deal.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.700
And Lee Copeland is probably not one of our listeners,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.940
so I can say this.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.460
Actually, I love the Star Conference.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.460
I've had a long history with them.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.980
At Star West last fall, I gave a keynote and a tutorial.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.820
When I signed a little paperwork for the tutorial,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.140
the fine print that I, in hindsight, was very clear.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.220
But that I missed is that when you do this particular

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.820
tutorial, you sign up to do it at Star West and then Star

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.490
East in the same year.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.730
I'm giving a tutorial on testing,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.610
where I talk about whatever I want for four hours.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.220
I have a format that actually works really well for that.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.500
Yeah, I'll just go ahead and share it.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.180
Well, what I did for Star West,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.940
I should talk through this.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.140
I have a little plan here.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.340
What I did for Star West is I took questions

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.180
at the beginning of the talk.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.100
I took about 40 questions just to start off the ballot.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.780
What do you guys want to talk about?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.300
And I wrote them all down,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.380
gave them about five minutes off to get a drink of water.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.500
I sort of equivalence classed them into buckets

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.460
and figured, okay, there's about three or four

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.730
or five talks I can give.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.770
How many people in this room?

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.010
There were about, oh, 75, 80 in the room.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.690
So you're basically doing lean coffee

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.130
with everyone at the same table.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.370
It was great to talk on the fly.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.770
And I won't go into the classes to questions.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.010
They're all stuff I was comfortable talking about.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.570
And then I, at the end, we kind of made sure

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.530
we covered everything.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.690
And it worked out really well,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.450
but what was interesting is I had two distinct classes

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.290
of feedback on that session as well.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.730
One was, I love the unstructured format.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.330
It was great to get my questions answered

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.490
and have the context of the tutorial,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.530
meet whatever everybody wanted.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.650
That was one class.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.970
The unstructured format is fantastic.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.130
I need more of this.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.250
And then some people said,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.290
I would have preferred a more structured format.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.450
The slides did not match the content

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.930
because I had to prepare some slides in advance.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.870
So I'm not as stupid as I sound.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.230
This time I made up slides,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.710
sort of matched what I talked about at Star West,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.510
assuming the questions would be about the same.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.030
And now I'm gonna do the same thing.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.510
I'll take questions in advance, all equivalence class them,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.390
and then I'll go through my slides in order.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.630
And on those slides, or like discussion slides,

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.310
well, I'll basically do the exact same format,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.990
but hopefully anticipating,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.310
not that the reviewers, the feedback,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.990
I take with all of the grain of salt,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.670
but that's my plan.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.830
So very free form.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.830
I want everybody that comes there,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.550
if they're coming to see a stupid talk

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.910
called Alan Page on testing,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.710
the least I can do is try and answer your testing questions.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.550
A pot?

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.670
Yes, a pot.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.630
Are you going to a pot?

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.950
To make it even more interesting,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.910
I'm taking the red eye Sunday night,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.230
and then my talk is at one o'clock on Monday afternoon.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.570
So could you just do your slide deck,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.890
just be one slide with a gigantic question mark?

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.100
I could, but I'm trying to be

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.460
a little bit more proactive than that.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.220
So anyway, I got that thing going on, kind of fun.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.340
There is a, one cool thing Lee does

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.260
is lightning strikes the keynotes,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.940
and he gets a bunch of people who are already there,

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.820
who typically give keynotes at conferences

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.980
to just each give a five minute lightning talk.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.140
Doing that Tuesday night.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.180
So I got the tutorial Monday afternoon,

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.100
I can sleep in Tuesday morning,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.180
attend some sessions,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.380
and then Tuesday evening for the closing

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.020
Tuesday keynote, lightning talks.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.260
Is this sort of a soapbox format?

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.140
Soapbox format, anything I want,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.540
I'm not going to use slides because,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.560
one, I'm not really, I can talk about anything,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.500
but mostly because I haven't decided on a topic yet.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.820
So I'm going to use this time

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.180
in front of our massive audience to ask Brent,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.460
if I had five minutes,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.160
if I have five minutes to talk about testing,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.080
what should I talk about?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.260
Oh, I should talk about anything I want,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.260
doesn't have to be testing.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.860
I can talk about the-

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.700
Peaches.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.840
Peaches and peanuts and other P words.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.800
Peanuticle.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.940
Peanuticle.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.280
Based on blogs and based on the podcasts

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.240
and based on feedback lately,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.080
I think probably the most valuable thing

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.560
is what we've been talking about,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.730
which is leading change.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.570
And-

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.610
I thought you were going to say,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.970
talk about nothing for five minutes.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.170
No, I said most valuable.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.490
Oh, gotcha.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.010
If I were to pull together that talk,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.610
the first thing is,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.050
it would be something along the lines of,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.130
wake the hell up.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.590
Someone has moved your cheese,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.590
and you guys should be focusing on

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.490
how you're going to lead your people

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.170
towards this new world,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.410
towards modernization versus the path

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.970
of the COBOL programmers.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.360
Yeah, I think the challenge there is,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.800
people are still eating their cheese

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800
from the same place,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.560
and even if it's there or not.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.900
And I think there's a missing step there

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.060
of getting people used to,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.100
things are changing.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.220
How we do testing is changing.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.620
Okay, so here is the title of your lightning talk.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.940
Test is still dead.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.780
Test-

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.280
Test zombies must die.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.370
It's been three, four years since

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.330
Whittaker did his test is dead thing.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.250
And we're both friends of James.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.930
We know he added his own,

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.530
you know, drama and excitement to that.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.890
But I was surprised with that,

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.890
how many people couldn't see past

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.010
the pomp and circumstance,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.290
to the actual parts of what he was saying,

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.950
which were true and predictive of,

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.090
in some ways predictive of where we're going now.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.410
Yep, but test is still dead.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.690
But remember what I said,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.770
test zombies must die.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.090
Zombies are dead,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.210
but they're still so moaning around,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.910
causing the old world to still stay around,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.210
causing friction towards where we need to go.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.390
Zombies are, I almost said brainless,

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:21.150
but not well known for their thinking capacity, right?

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.690
These are the people that we need

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.090
to flush out of the system,

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.850
which by either killing them dead

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.490
or figuring out how to resuscitate them back to life.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.650
Yeah, but if you look at the world of software,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.570
one thing is looking at the context

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.450
of where all these people are coming from.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.990
You have big companies,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.230
you have your Googles and your Netflix

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.430
and Amazon and Microsofts.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.050
And you also have, on the other end of things,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.570
you have a ton of people who are making

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.330
and testing software that is just for internal IT apps.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.850
It never sees an end user base

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.150
beyond a few hundred or maybe a thousand people.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.460
So the audience, are these generally folks

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.300
who are concerned about the role of testing

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.140
or are they testers?

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.660
No, it's, star is interesting.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.700
When Lee, typically,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.140
I've been going to stars off and on for a decade,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.140
and Lee Copeland usually kick it off.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.220
He asks questions like,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.860
how many of you have been testing software

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.940
for less than a year?

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.120
And half to three quarters of the hands go up.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.840
And usually it's someone just been hired as a tester,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.160
just been converted to a tester,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.540
just part of a company that formed a test organization.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.560
They said, we need you to learn testing,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.630
go to this conference.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.470
That's a star.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.330
So there's some weird context there.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.870
Well, you know what?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.330
That's probably cheaper than existing models,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.890
given the ROI.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.770
If companies are insisting

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.390
on having dedicated folks around testing,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.030
then yes, they should spend as little money on it as possible.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.190
Well, it's funny you mentioned that.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.150
I saw a tweet this week in reference to,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.870
again, in reference to James Whittaker's

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.630
three or four year old talk.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.050
And the statement was,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.830
I'm gonna paraphrase it wrongly,

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.550
but it's something to the effect of,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.750
companies who advertise that they don't use

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.470
skilled testers for testing aren't making good software.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.930
That's not the exact quote, I'm sorry.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.430
But with the point being that you have to,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.310
I think the assertion was,

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.510
that you have to have skilled testers looking at a project,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.590
for it to be a quality project.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.780
How many testers does a company have to hire

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.500
to fulfill that advertising criteria?

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.340
I don't know.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.180
I don't know.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.020
But the point is that you and I know

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.940
is for a lot of things,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.620
of course you need people looking at things.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.180
And of course there's a human factor.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.140
I'm not going to dismiss that.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.140
But you could actually get a lot of information

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.300
about product quality,

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.980
and even how useful people find it,

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.060
through inference from data.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.900
And I think that's the-

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.500
And all sorts of data,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.340
pre-production, post-production,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.140
customer data, service data.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.260
That is a huge leap that,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.620
and you and I both know also,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.460
that can be done,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.500
that's been done for services forever,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.340
but you and I are both,

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.840
we can do that for connected devices

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.860
of any kind, anywhere as well.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.300
I think that's a leap that a lot of people

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.860
aren't quite ready to make yet.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.960
Yeah, no, one of the arguments I get all the time,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.020
but we're a client application.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.940
We can't do it.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.140
I'm like, why not?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.100
Because-

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.140
Because we're a client application.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.220
No, that just means you are slow.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.620
Well, usually it's worse.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.900
Usually not just client,

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.100
not just their client application.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.260
They go, well, we're really unique,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.700
and we have special needs

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.180
that aren't covered by anything else

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.180
that's been done and proven correct in the industry.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.660
Yes, you do have special needs,

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.540
but perhaps not the ones you're referring to.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.220
I was on vacation last week,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.060
just as a quick aside, and then I wanted-

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.980
We are a podcast full of quick asides.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.180
Please continue.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.700
I was on vacation last week,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.180
and the one thing that I did

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.180
that was work related is one of the,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.270
how do I obfuscate this sufficiently?

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.550
One of the Apple related groups

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.730
asked me to come and do a presentation.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.010
And I got that question,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.650
but we're a client.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.610
How do we do this?

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.130
The only thing that's relevant

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.770
because you're a client

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.050
is the fact that you have a slower release cycle.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.930
And I'm going to argue

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.380
that that means that your telemetry,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.380
your telemetry investment needs to be even greater

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.180
because you don't have the ability

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.850
to quickly enhance your telemetry.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.370
Even client teams can go into this world

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.090
of using the data primarily to derive direction.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.210
But if you have a slow release cycle,

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.450
then that means you need to have

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.450
a bit more precise data.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.730
You have less room,

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.890
a little less room for experimentation

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.530
and for your margin of error is a little less,

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.770
but you can still,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.930
there's still a ton of value you can get.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.490
Absolutely a ton of value.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.290
So the on test things,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.530
are you, is there any of your topics

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.290
that you're willing to talk about

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:23.770
here today?

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.610
Like what do you think is,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.090
what was the number one question at West?

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.730
I can put them into two main groups.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.250
And I think my slides are associated this way.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.170
One is a lot of questions around

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.480
testers rolling on Agile team.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.840
And you and I have talked a lot about that,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.680
kind of where that's going.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.200
And I think I'll answer a lot of questions about that

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.760
and how that should work.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.360
Remind me, I had an estimation followup from last week.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.880
I'll get back to that in a minute.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.840
So a lot of stuff about rolling on Agile team.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.680
What does it mean?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.520
And I have a lot of, you know,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.680
lot of advice there.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.520
The other one is-

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.200
Is it essentially C Lisa's book?

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.970
I definitely referenced the Lisa Crispin,

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.330
Janet Gregory Agile testing book

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.410
are some great things to learn there.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.410
It's a great start.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.130
But just thinking about things like,

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.090
I love testers being involved in defining

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.330
what done looks like

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.290
and having a say in that.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.850
And because there's traps that teams fall into,

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.410
the fragile kind of things of,

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.610
oh, test is going to test in iteration N plus one,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.850
what was written, was coded in iteration N.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.250
And you have stabilization iterations.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.090
Those kinds of things,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.050
we just kind of just,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.690
we talk about why they don't work,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.450
talk about some leading change and change management

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.290
and how you get the team all on the same page.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.730
It's the any Agile coach,

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.730
anybody who's been on an Agile team for a while,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.450
it's just talking through the people

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.810
that are new to the process

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.690
and kind of their problems and those kinds of things.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.220
It's been a while since I've read Lisa's book,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.140
but it does remind me of a continual debate

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.700
between Alan and I.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.100
And that's the concept.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.740
One thing that he and I both agree with,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.700
in an Agile team,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.500
there is no world for people who are pure generalists

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.220
or pure specialists.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.180
Agreed.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.140
What we disagree on is generalizing specialists

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.420
or specializing generalists.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.800
Generalizing specialists.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.280
Specializing generalists.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.960
Are you great?

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.600
What I think you need to do on any team

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.880
is build the right pieces of the puzzle.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.360
You need a lot of things done.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.360
You need people that you need,

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.200
you need backup,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.360
you need complementary and both complementary skills

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.760
and diversification of skills.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.040
And Brent's having technical difficulties

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.640
because he can't stop talking with his hands.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.730
So yeah, anyway, a lot of questions about Agile,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:48.770
moving on.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.290
Then I get a lot of questions.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.570
Sorry, the reason why I brought that up though,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.660
is Agile, when you say testers in an Agile team,

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.290
is that a specialist,

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.250
a testing specialist inside of an Agile team?

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.410
Generally a testing specialist within an Agile team,

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.610
but they haven't quite figured out that transition yet.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.930
I think when a lot of teams first moved to Agile,

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.490
they stick with the strict role definition

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.870
and role responsibilities with walls in between.

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.570
The walls in Agile more than any place else

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.010
need to go away.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.370
Yeah.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.370
Or blend.

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.490
Blend is probably a better way

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.090
because you do have generalizing specialists

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.770
and that's where the blend comes from.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.410
I am my role on an Agile team.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.370
I'm holding back from diving into this argument now.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:36.650
You know, my role on an Agile team is I am,

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.970
I'm the testing and quality

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.890
and often process and efficiency specialist.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.490
Those are things I'm good at.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.810
And I think it behooves anyone,

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.130
if you're part of a team,

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.410
leverage your strengths,

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.570
find the things you're good at

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.610
and use those to make the team better.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.570
There's additional challenges.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.410
So it's great that we're both in agreement

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.370
that the pure tester specialist must die.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.470
One of the things that happens,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.010
if those guys are there,

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.970
then that encourages the need for us

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.170
or it encourages the dysfunctional stabilization period.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.330
And once that bad boy's in there,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.970
you're never gonna get out of Scrum or Fall.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.730
And one thing you said,

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.250
I want to clarify in a little bit,

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.530
is you said the pure testing specialist.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.730
You're right in your mind and you're right in general,

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.610
but I think what a lot of the meaning of what test is

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:38.610
and what testers do is so bizarre, bastardized, freaked out.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.810
Oh, I saw a blog post today.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.010
Someone said, stop sending me recruiting memos

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.890
for a software engineer and test.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.850
I am a software quality engineer.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.810
I go, what the hell does it matter?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.180
Titles don't mean anything.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.780
I wrote a blog post this long time ago.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.500
But the point is that you can say,

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.260
I'm a pure testing specialist,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.140
but in that I look at code flow and process

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.660
and this and that and you actually know

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.930
you're actually a specializing generalist

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.360
or a generalizing specialist.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.360
I like watching.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.560
Great.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.480
Did you just agree with me on the air?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.480
My eyes go up and down.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.840
So wait, there's even more.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.240
After my Tuesday night,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.000
so that's, and I'll talk about those.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.440
I have some career advice that I like to share

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.080
at these things, especially for new testers.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.080
I have things about how to grow in your career.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.480
I didn't plan on talking about those at Star West,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.880
but I had the slides in my deck

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.960
and one of the questions was,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.040
what the heck are these slides for?

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.440
I said, oh, let me talk through those.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.840
So I wanna be a little bit more purposeful about it

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.000
and it went over very well.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.840
So I'm gonna be more personal

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840
at talking about career advice.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.200
So that's on Monday afternoon,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.920
Tuesday night got the lightning talk.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.680
I get Wednesday and Thursday.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.080
I could go to Disney World,

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.280
but being a 48 year old man going to Disney World

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.280
by yourself seems a little pathetic to me.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.320
So I'm probably just gonna do what I,

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.880
I'll go to sessions.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.960
I will talk to people.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.560
I'll probably get a bunch of work done

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.200
because my day job continues.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.920
And then on Friday of that week,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.160
Star does the leadership summit,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.040
where a portion of the people of the conference

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.360
hang around for one more day of stuff.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.480
And I went last year, I was a member of the panel

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.480
answering random questions from the audience.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.560
And I was impressed by the,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.560
say it's a leadership conference.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.920
So it's, you never know what's gonna be there

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.840
in test managers and test leaders,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.720
but very mature audience with great questions

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.880
and great insights.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.480
It was fun to be part of that crowd.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.760
And I was asked to come back

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.480
and give the keynote, opening keynote,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.960
or actually the only keynote for that talk this year.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.880
So I'm talking about leadership on Friday.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.840
Test zombies must die.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.860
And I think the thing is, and again,

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.020
it goes back to the, a little back to our leading change,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.340
actually a big part of it.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.780
And if you see my talks before,

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.780
they'll reference books I like and books I've read,

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.020
but some of the main points I'm gonna talk about there are,

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.860
you can't, you know, getting rid of command and control,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.900
you know, software engineers are knowledge workers.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.760
You can't manage them like you manage factory workers.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.440
My big thing is give people a framework they can work in,

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.080
let them know the rules of the game,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.560
be transparent about what you value,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.620
and then get out of their way.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.300
So you just listed off two of the three things

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.660
we talked about last time.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.500
You said-

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.340
Accidentally.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.180
People-

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.100
I can't remember that back that far.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.390
You said the people and the processes.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.870
And you also got to get the right technology in-house

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.670
to support those other two aspects.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.190
The most important thing is,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.710
the most important thing to get right

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.180
is the people behavior.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.140
And making sure that they are working towards

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.020
the common goal, which I believe is all about

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.780
people moving in this new world.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.340
Our job is acceleration.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.340
Our job is to look at what is the behaviors

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.020
of everything that's involved,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.660
whether it be dev behavior,

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:10.140
or product behavior, or the customer behavior.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.940
And making sure that we're clear on what is the goals

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.180
that are valuable to the business,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.740
and that we're helping to accelerate

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.980
those things towards that.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.260
But it's how you do it that's critical.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.020
You can be a leader and say,

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.860
there's a couple things that happen

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.980
when leaders try and do this, that don't work.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.860
One is they tell people what to do and they don't do it.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.820
Well, that's command and control, it doesn't work.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.660
Right.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.300
And these are knowledge workers.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.020
We have creative people, we have people

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.140
who can figure things out on their own.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.660
We need to let them do that.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.460
So the things that are very prescriptive

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.620
and some practical advice there is,

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.180
one, as a leader, be transparent about what you value.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.220
Just make sure people know that they're not,

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.660
I value output, what you get done,

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.220
I value that you have business impact,

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.220
customer impact, and collaboration working with others.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.380
Those are the three big things I value

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.420
people I work with.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.740
But it's not just value.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.740
You gotta put muscle on it.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.900
What do you mean by muscle?

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.740
So you don't have to fight with it.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.260
You just say, hey, I believe in fuzzy bunnies.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.340
Well, great.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.700
But if you don't give the same people a framework

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.740
for which you're measuring it, or the definition of success,

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.740
this is how I know if we have achieved it.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.940
And visibly recognize and celebrate

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.580
when people are demonstrating those values.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.420
I don't like carrots and sticks.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.820
I believe, I'm a big fan of, if you've read

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.820
beyond the five minute video of Dan Pink's drivebook,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.700
people are motivated by progress.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.460
People are, when they see things working,

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.300
people get excited.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.820
You don't need to give them, hey, you got all your estimates

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.300
right last week, here's a $100 bonus.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.900
It's stupid.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.340
No, but they want to know that the work that they're doing

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.860
is contributing to the greater good of the people

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.620
around them, which is generally the teams

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.460
and the team's cohesive goal.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.060
You just mentioned, like yesterday I had a fantastic event.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.420
So I, on a weekly basis, attend, it's essentially

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.700
an exec status report meeting.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.860
I thought you were going to say drum circle, but go on.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.320
No.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.240
And one of the guys presented a report that says,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.850
we are able to measure something.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.290
And it is only ever working.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.890
All of our customers, only 10% of our customers

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.660
ever have a good experience.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.460
So 90% of the kind of customers are using this particular thing.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.320
It's all on the floor.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:46.830
That initiated from the VP a 15 minute praise storm

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.720
towards that individual for being brave enough to bring in

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:57.720
that bad news to showing that they have the technology now

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.280
to prove that we suck and that it was truth-based.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.720
The VP was like, finally, we're able to measure

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.680
the customer impact of this thing.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.920
And that is a massive win.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.520
And that is happening.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.680
This is the first time I've ever done that.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.520
I've seen a VP do this.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.360
But I'm seeing the incidence of that type of thing

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.720
happening over and over again.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.880
What's important, green means how close do you

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.720
map to the truth as opposed to how on track are we

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.960
or any of these other sort of bullshit vanity metrics?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.720
You need to walk the talk.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.640
You need to walk the talk.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.720
If you say you're going to do this, and I'm sure you and I

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.280
and many others have been a part of trying

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.360
to tell people what they think they want to hear versus telling

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.280
them the truth.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.880
And until you visibly recognize and reward

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.600
is not the right word, but recognize and celebrate,

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.360
this praise fest was a celebration,

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.670
recognize and celebrate the culture you want,

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:03.670
it's not going to happen.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.470
That's a really huge part of that.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.350
And this VP, just to be clear, the reason

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:13.070
why I went on this diatribe, he has made it very clear,

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:18.230
his high order principle is that we keenly understand

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:24.960
customer impact, that we keenly understand customer pain.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.000
And if that's the things your organization cares about,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.600
which it probably should be for most organizations,

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.080
you have to be transparent and honest about that.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.800
You can't go into that meeting thinking,

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.400
well, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news,

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.000
because that would make me look bad.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.920
So I'm just going to tell, I'm going to gloss over it

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.600
and kind of find the right way to put lipstick on the pig

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.800
and make it look all right.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.920
That's the wrong thing to do.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.720
And the other challenge leaders have,

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.120
they'll say, Ellen, I get everything you're saying,

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.680
but I have a hard time getting my management to buy off

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.000
on this.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.700
And I say, yeah, I see Brent about to jump in,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.410
but that's your job.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:13.210
You as a leader, you constantly need to manage up,

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.890
not in a suck up kind of way, but being honest and transparent

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.770
about what's going on and about what your expectations are.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.730
It's part of what you need to do.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.730
And I hate seeing, and I see us on Twitter all the time,

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.810
and it bugs the crap out of me, is constantly throwing,

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.330
I want to do x, but management won't let me.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.770
It would be great if we do x, but our management

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:35.730
is not supportive.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.690
So what I heard you say, what I heard you say initially

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:44.910
is, I would love to remove command and control,

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.470
but management won't let me.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.460
It's a while one loop.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.820
And the only way to break out of a while one loop

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.170
is control out, delete, and kill the damn process.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.770
The problem with that guy, so I get those type of things

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.530
all the time.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:06.690
And I go, OK, here's a couple of techniques you should try.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.890
Number one, if your management won't do it transparently,

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.210
it's probably because he's risk adverse.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.810
Everybody is built in different ways.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.410
I can kick Mr. Risk Adversus ass every time

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.610
by showing success.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.810
Yes.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.810
And what you need to do is, can you

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:29.610
fund a small pilot project that will resonate

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:34.170
with your management that will say, hey, look,

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.130
this same team tried it one way.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.290
They tried it another way.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.770
And look, it's better.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.010
Maybe we should try to scale this up to everybody else.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.370
The Risk Adverse people, they're always

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:49.570
going to leverage what they've known that works.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.970
They're going to be fond of best practices.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.050
At that level, their decision-making framework

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.010
is entirely based off of their experience.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.770
And you're asking them to improve something

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.210
they have no experience enough, and neither do you.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:07.850
And also, I can share a story from real life right now.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.130
We have at Microsoft a lot of people

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.450
with a lot of experience at very high levels.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.090
And guess what?

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.050
All that experience is at Microsoft.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.330
Where I'm getting to is, I've done the same thing

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.540
for a long time, and they've had success doing that.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.580
And they think the way forward is just

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.420
to keep on doing the same thing.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.540
Because that's what got them there.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.980
Must be able to get them there.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.140
But that's not always the case.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.540
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.140
But what do you mean if it ain't broke?

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.500
Well, look at our metrics.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.900
They've been green for the last 15 years.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.460
How do you know if it's broke if you don't know anything

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.380
but what you're doing?

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.220
I think my car is supposed to go rattle, rattle, bang,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.620
rattle, rattle, bang when I drive it.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.540
Because that's the way it's worked for the last 10 years.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.220
You don't know what you don't know.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.180
Exactly.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.380
One of the speeches that I've been given a lot lately

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.560
is around a heuristic that I've discovered.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.880
And I first discovered it with Agile.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.880
And it's just simply this.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.160
When you try to deploy a tool or a framework

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.720
within your current team, and it's painful as all hell,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.800
do a quick search to see what the world feels about it.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.520
And if you discovered that there are

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.240
a nontrivial number of people who are very happy with it,

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.560
then odds are the way it's deployed on your team is wrong.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560
Very well put.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.600
Is there anything else I was going to say about?

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.320
Leadership.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.080
Cover Star.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.440
Yeah, leadership.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.600
I think we covered it.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.520
So when does Star become Squar?

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.760
Scar.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.560
Not my decision to make.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.160
It'll be fun.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.960
I hope to meet some people there.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.240
I could bring my stuff and record a little BOTUS edition

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.200
podcast there.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.720
I could grab a random tester and interview him.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.880
And then we could over-dub you later going, bullshit!

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:08.260
We could actually do a link session.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.100
No, it makes for coming recordings.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.100
Yeah.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.500
So Alan is the technical recording engineer.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.420
There's a crapload of credits that we haven't given him here.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.500
I am the prettier one.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.980
His job is to do the technical stuff.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.380
Yeah, that's the way my career works.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.300
So anyway, that's Star.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.860
It's coming up the first week of May.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.780
I'll be in Orlando.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.540
If any of our three listeners wanted to go there,

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.580
is it too late?

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.540
No, I don't think so.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.900
I think you just show up and give them a bunch of money

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.300
and do what you think.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.700
I'll be hanging out in the lobby.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.220
So it doesn't cost money to see me.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.940
But I don't know how it works out.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.980
All right.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.820
Oh, I'm going to save.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.620
I'm pointing at the Kanban board.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.700
I'm going to bring up number two as a mail bed question.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.020
So I'm going to save that one.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.970
Let's go on to Brett.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:01.370
What have you been thinking about lately?

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.450
Well, so nothing.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.010
Yeah, that's what you did last time.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.010
I'm not going to go too deep on this.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:12.450
I'll tell you the type of things that I'm focusing on lately

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:18.130
is number one, the current shiny thing that I'm diving into

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.090
is engagement more deeply.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.010
So engagement, I've talked many times.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.010
What does engagement mean?

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.810
Are you getting married?

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.290
I'm already married, Alan.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.290
Thank you.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.250
All right, so then what does engagement mean?

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:41.180
Engagement is sort of the study of how users behave

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.820
on all sort of aspects of life.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.040
If it's the study of, would it be engagementology?

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.560
Is it always a la-cheek?

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.200
I don't know.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.880
It could be engagement tree.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:58.820
So engagement is customers?

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.420
Yeah, so engagement is whether or not your customers,

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.660
in our context, it's whether or not your customers

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.820
are having a delightful experience.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:16.300
Like one of my favorite stories is that we learned here

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.380
years ago there was a product we had,

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.020
and we compared it to a competitor's product.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.820
We'd have customers come in, and they

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.940
would evaluate both products.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.180
Our product, people were 90% successful,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.140
more successful on performing the tasks.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.500
A typical usability study, we'll walk people

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.220
through doing things like, hey, calculate one plus one,

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.940
or schedule a media request, or make a phone call,

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:49.060
or save a spreadsheet, things like that.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.620
This particular product, we were 90% more successful.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.180
People were able to achieve those tasks.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.980
But the thing that was fascinating

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:03.420
was that 70% of the people in that particular study

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.820
walked out of the room saying, wow, I

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.620
have to go buy that competitor's product.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.220
That didn't work out very well, did it?

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.860
No, because the pivot was wrong.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.420
We were much more successful at getting work done,

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.260
but the other product was fun.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.260
It was engaging.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.100
It made people want to come back.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.340
So they were perfectly happy being less efficient

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.780
on getting the effort done, because they

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.740
were having a fun time exploring,

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.460
a fun time figuring things out.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.860
That's interesting.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.780
Logically, that's counterintuitive.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.180
When you sit back and think about what products you like,

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:43.060
you go, oh my gosh, that makes sense.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.340
I want to have fun using this product, even

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.260
if it is a spreadsheet app or some business-y thing.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.580
That's a great point.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.900
One of the topics that I'm beginning

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:58.940
to dive in a bit more deeply on is this concept of gamification

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.860
for engagement.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.860
And so one of the things that they found out

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.780
is people like games, all people.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.580
They like games.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.820
They like little reward systems.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.700
Different people like different games.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.380
I'm not super fond of trivia games,

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.180
but I love puzzles as an example.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.060
It's a sort of a scientific study

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.380
around how to use this concept of games

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.340
to improve engagement on whatever you want to engage on.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.980
After spreading the last five years, or two years

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.300
physically, on Xbox, obviously there

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.820
is where those gamer points that are worth nothing,

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.900
that's sort of the root of gamification.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.700
And I've applied that sort of concept

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.780
on lots of different things.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.500
People will do amazing things for points

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.650
that aren't worth anything.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.410
So I also used to work in Xbox.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.570
And I remember one of the team meetings

00:35:54.570 --> 00:36:00.680
I had where I explained that games, one of the patterns

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.800
that I had noticed, is that games

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.640
were the inconvenient tax that allowed people to convert

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.220
dollars to achievement points.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.940
Because there was a lot of users who just go and buy

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.620
the $1 stupid game just to pound through it,

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:22.060
just to get the extra 200 achievement points.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:27.020
And Microsoft as a business is quite OK enabling

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.740
that behavior.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.500
Yeah, it's interesting though for engagement.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.180
I wonder why more applications, more like line of business

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:39.940
and not games, don't have some sort of gamification aspect

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:45.000
to encourage usage and learning the product.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.520
One of the case studies, so right now there's

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.400
very few platforms doing this.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.240
Badgeville.com is the primary platform

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.320
for enabling gamification.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.800
And one of their major case studies

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.690
is gamifying knowledge management.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.730
So you get points for creating a post.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.490
You get points for reading posts.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.650
You get points for editing posts.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.890
And I said, wow, I wonder if that will change the sort

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:16.610
of typical Wikipedia contribution percentages.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:21.390
It's like 1% contribute and 90 zillion percent.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.030
Just good math there, Brent.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.190
Yeah, plus or minus a few zillions.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.870
Well, this is why I think the Stack Overflow and Stack

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.470
Exchange family of websites have been so successful,

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:34.230
is they've taken a question and answer forum concept

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.390
and brilliantly applied gamification.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.070
I mean, I don't know if you know how this works.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.110
It's not only points you get for being.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.870
You get points for answering questions

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.310
and doing the right things and having good questions that

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.510
are upvoted, et cetera.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.790
But as you get more points, you

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:50.870
get more privileges on the site.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.430
So the top contributors become basically the administrators.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.230
And as you get farther up, you go, oh, I can now edit posts.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.550
I can now look at the, without too much,

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.990
you get fairly involved.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.550
And you start getting the, when you log in, you can see,

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.110
oh, there's been suggested edits that you have to approve.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.270
And it's fun.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.510
You get, oh, I feel important now.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.870
Now I want to be more engaged.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.030
So there's a book that I'm reading as well called

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:22.790
a Gamification by Design, which I found there is a website.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.630
I think it's itbooks.com.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.790
Might be IT Dash Books, where they have the book available

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.190
for personal use only, but free as a PDF format.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.590
So you work at Microsoft.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.760
Why are you so freaking cheap?

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.880
I am one Microsoft, and I will eliminate costs as I see it.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.480
Anyway, so one of the experiments

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.400
that I'm going to be doing, incidentally,

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.280
I buy all my own books with my own money.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.740
So when I get fired, I can keep them.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.540
But anyway, go on.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.940
I buy all my own books with Microsoft's money

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.140
so that when I get fired, I will still keep them.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.020
Different values.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.940
Anyway, by the time that I plan on getting fired,

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.340
those books will be irrelevant anyway.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.140
One of the things that I'm experimenting with,

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.900
so I don't know if I told you, but I

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.460
have a confirmed new listener to our podcast.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.920
And that is my eldest son is now a big fan.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.280
It's mainly for me, I know.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.420
Yes, it's all about you.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:35.780
And one of the things that he recognized,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:40.780
because I'm about to gamify our chores system.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:47.060
So right now on my blog, the second most popular blog post

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.740
on my site is the Canban for Chores.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.660
It's a system that works very well.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.740
It was inspired by Alan.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.700
I only tweeted about it.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.580
I didn't blog about it, so I don't have any copyright.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.540
It's still inspired.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.520
I love Canban for Chores.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.000
The kids still love it.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.400
But engagement on the Chores system has dropped.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.440
You know why they love it?

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.790
I'll tie it back to my leadership talk.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.670
One of the big rules of Canban is

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.830
limit your work in progress, but visualize your work.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:23.390
And by visualizing your work, you see the progress.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:24.990
People are motivated by progress.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.750
People like seeing stuff moved to the done column,

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.230
whether it's work that we do every day at work or chores.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.630
You know, with my kids, I don't think that's the main reason.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.430
The main reason is because they get

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.390
to pick what they want to do.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:44.570
Well, the main reason is exactly that.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:48.570
So me and my wife will put a various number of chores

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:52.290
into the ready column, and they get to pick.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.890
And so when we batch load the ready column,

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:56.970
they're in there.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:58.410
They're like, oh, I want that one.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.530
I'm not taking that one.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.730
The other thing my kids have learned from that as an aside

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.970
is how to break down tasks.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.490
We'll put even homework into ours,

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.810
but we'll work together on how to take a long thing,

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.490
like a book report, and break it down into chunks they can do.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.250
I'm going to do this chunk of my homework.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.770
I'm going to write down the outline for my report.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.530
And then I'm going to go pull weeds or whatever.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.850
And then I know I can put it off till tomorrow.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:25.690
I can go through it.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:26.970
I can write the first draft.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.490
That's another task on there.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.850
But then I can break things down because my kids are

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:31.530
a little younger.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:32.970
The oldest just turned 10.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.010
And they like to do everything, whether it's

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.050
a chore or homework, in about half hour chunks.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:42.540
And they want to be done with it and do something else.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.540
I'll need to talk to you about that later

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.060
because my youngest son, I think

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.700
it's a clever idea putting homework up on that board.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.500
Anyway, one of the things I do want to do

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.540
is gamify the board because now what the kids are doing

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.520
is there's certain minimums that they

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.000
have to do to get the rates across.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.240
And they've lost their initial glossy feel

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.160
about how the system worked.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.400
And now they just want to do the minimum

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.020
because it's still a chore.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.260
And so what I want to do is use gamification

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:20.540
to see if I can't improve their throughput rate on how

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.340
chores get across.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.060
Very interesting.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.700
I love optimizing processes, whether it's

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.170
home life or software.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.570
We got about eight minutes left here.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:35.440
I want to get to the mailbag.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.040
That was fantastic, Ellen.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.840
You're getting really good at this.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.960
I practice it on the car on the way to work.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.640
So the first one is from my own mailbag.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.840
And this is one is addressed.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.320
Dear Dr. Brent, Mr. Brent.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.760
Oh, it's your mailbag.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.070
It's my own personal mailbag.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:59.310
We talked last week about estimation quite a bit.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.670
They want to dive deeply into it.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:01.670
We didn't talk about it.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.230
You made fun of me 20 minutes last week on estimation.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.510
I make fun of you all the time.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.630
All right, fair enough.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:11.100
What do you hear the overdubs I add to this one?

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.980
So I had a mail this week and said,

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.380
didn't quite say, dear Mr. Brent.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.460
But I'll phrase it that way.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.740
Anyway, the question was, Alan, get to the point.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.380
The comment or question was, I want

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:31.870
to have accurate estimates in hours or days for my team.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:34.710
And then because I want to do that because I want to hold

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:38.300
them accountable for their estimates.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:43.330
What do you think about that?

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.670
Brent's boiling.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.430
I would like to have a personal one-on-one conversation

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:52.430
with this individual.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.150
And what would you like to say to them?

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:59.550
Something along the lines of WTF.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:07.450
So what I heard you say is, I like how the sun's shown in 1996.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:10.810
And I'm going to continue to pretend the sun shines exactly

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.580
that same way.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:19.100
I want to have accurate hourly estimates.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.900
So just to make this extra fun,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.340
can you tell me how long their milestone ship cycle is?

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.380
When he does planning for how many weeks?

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.740
I'm expecting something on the order of months.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.900
Well, and let me finish my conversation,

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.100
finish the statement here.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.020
His team works on one-month iterations.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:45.260
But he does do his, air quote, costing three months in advance.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.440
So to the good employees of that manager,

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.320
I and Alan both have open positions.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.240
And we'd happily talk to you about how

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.680
the hell to get out of hell.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.620
So that is absolutely not helpful.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.980
So you're saying, hey, I want strong estimations.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.260
I want my guys to know upfront three months of advance things

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.260
that they cannot possibly know.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.980
And I'm going to hold them accountable

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:30.300
to their estimations, which means in addition to that,

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.060
I'm going to hold them accountable to them

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:32.900
being on track.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.060
So what's going to happen in order for them

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.220
to have that accountability, that guy

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.220
is going to have massively bloated estimates.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:41.900
Absolutely.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.260
And this is my calmer, yet inspired by the same fire

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.220
response to this was predicting things

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.060
is hard, especially about the future.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.660
Estimates are educated guesses.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:01.210
And it's not only going to be wrong.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:04.090
It's not only acceptable that they're wrong.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.210
It's expected that they're wrong.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.810
And you're going to learn from them.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.690
If you hold people accountable for estimates,

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:15.050
100% of the time, OK, 99.99% because someone's

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:16.450
going to be an outlier, you will

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.610
drive the wrong behavior, which means

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.250
extra padding on estimates.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.410
Somebody working all weekend because they

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:24.970
got their estimate wrong.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.410
And just everything will be wrong.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:29.250
It just drives me nuts.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.970
So that was anyway.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.930
That model isn't encouraging.

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.370
It is blaming people for being wrong.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.250
It's not encouraging learning.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.610
I believe in a learning organization where you have these,

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.810
especially when you're trying to predict the future,

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:46.890
it's going to be wrong.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:47.810
And it's OK.

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.970
You can't hold people accountable for it.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.690
Like it's like, I'm going to predict

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.850
who's going to play in next year's Super Bowl

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:54.810
and who will win.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.330
And if I'm wrong, Brent has to punch me in the face.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:01.700
Yeah.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.180
Yes.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.700
That will result in my knuckles being sore repeatedly.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.700
This is not going to be a happy event for the person who's

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.700
being blamed.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.020
So I did write a blog around the,

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.340
it's like you included all kinds of things

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.180
that I'm allergic to.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.260
Number one, the word accountability.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.140
Accountability, guys, does not mean who do I get to blame.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.140
Accountability means who's going to stand up and take

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.580
responsibility and fix it.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.180
You can't top down, enforce accountability.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:38.060
Number two, this guy wants absolute estimates,

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.780
not relative.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.220
Guys, we don't do.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.940
Humans aren't capable of doing absolute estimates

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.620
to any degree, even on an hourly basis.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.220
This is not what we're built for.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.340
We're built for relative estimation.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.900
We're very good at that.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.740
Three, he wants to do three month out plan,

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.970
or he wants hour by hour estimation

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:07.770
for a month long milestone for a project that

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:11.410
is likely to entirely change in the next three months.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.900
All correct.

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.340
And he wants it to maintain accurate.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.340
And he's not building in a feedback system

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.740
so that when his team goes into the weeds,

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:27.220
his strategy to fix it seems to be finger pointing

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.580
and not encouraging them to learn what

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.860
causes the delay differential between their estimation

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:38.020
and the actual and improve it.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.620
Absolutely.

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.860
So this is fun.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.900
We're not going to get to our second mailbag question.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:42.980
We're running out of time.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.820
But I want to get some context on this question

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.780
in that normally Brent and I sort of talk through our list

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.180
and what's going to happen.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.700
And for this particular one, I said,

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.060
I'm going to bring up a mail I got about estimation.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.580
But that's all I'm going to tell you,

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.660
because I want to get your real time reaction.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.980
And Brent, you did not disappoint.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.380
Yes, thank you for that, Alan.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.220
We can dwell on that some more afterwards.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.180
But we're going to close off for now.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.900
Thanks everyone for listening.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.860
I'm Alan.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.780
And I'm Brent.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.780
And I'll see you later.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.300
Bye.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.780
I'm working on it.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.220
I see you sitting in.
