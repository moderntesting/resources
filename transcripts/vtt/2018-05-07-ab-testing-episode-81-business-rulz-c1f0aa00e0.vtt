WEBVTT

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.490
Hey everybody, I'm Alan. Brent is not here yet. Took a little bathroom break, so we're

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.250
going to get started with episode 81 of the AV testing podcast. Oh look, it's Brent. Brent,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:29.390
did you wash your hands? Yes. All right. All right. Excited to be here. How you doing,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.950
Brent? Fine. I'm sorry, I was a little premature in getting started. I couldn't wait. I was

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.400
excited. I understand. Do you know why I was excited? How? Because we're going to talk

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.240
about modern testing principles. Deep dive into the first modern testing principle. But we'll get

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.640
to that in a little bit. Let's catch up on stuff and do our normal banter. So if you don't like

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.000
this part, that was your chance to press that fast forward 30 seconds button about 75 times.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.080
Yes. So what you been up to? How you been? What's new? It's crazy. It's the period of the year

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.040
where everyone realizes there's two months left before the review and then all sorts of people

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.600
are doing stupid stuff. I don't miss that. I don't miss that at all. I went through it last

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.440
year. I realized I got to September. I go, wait a minute. I didn't have my blood pressure go through

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.760
the roof. People weren't freaking out. People weren't all behaving differently. That's so

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.880
weird. I really do think. I really do think. I haven't done the data analysis on this one,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.360
but I strongly suspect that I would find that we would, if I measured, that we would find that

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:46.060
from an hour basis, the Microsoft year is 15 months long because the last three months people

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.710
are putting in double time. I had a boss who had a phrase peak in May and it's absolutely true given

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.190
it's so weird how the review system of course isn't and paper isn't tied to results. Well,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.630
value. I'm not going to, I was going to just, I have a lot of rants about the system. Had them

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.110
while I was here. It seems unfair for me to rant too much about them while I'm not there.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.600
So I will just say I don't miss them. It has improved. There's still a long ways to go.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.400
If I'm going to be fair and realize that I'm still a Microsoft employee.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.040
Yeah. I wish to wish to remain. So for the least the short term.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.500
Huh. So I don't, for those of you not in the Slack channel, the one of the,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.900
one of the three Slack channel, one of the three dot slack.com, or just go to anger.com

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.100
slash AB testing. Click on the link to join. I posted there that I have a new member of the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.020
family, Tara, the modern testing puppy. The three have decided that your dog's name is Monty.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.060
Can Monty be a girl's name? Sure.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.140
I think, give me time. I haven't quite figured out what it's short for, but I'm going to go with yes.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.290
So, uh, rescue pup lab mix. I'd even do the doggy DNA thing. So we'll find out, uh, what actually

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.570
Mick. She is, but she's pretty hilarious, but it's like having a kid again because, uh, they,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.400
yeah, it's like having a kid again. Except the time they're a kid will last

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.300
much less longer. You know what else I did. You know what else? You know what else?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.060
Yes. What you took a trip. I did. I took a trip on a ship. Where in the world is the weasel? Uh,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.180
I was, I, Alaska airlines shot me down on Monday to Orlando, Florida, uh, where I gave a workshop

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.050
Tuesday morning on web testing tools and then flew back Wednesday evening, got back late.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.770
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I was going to go back and fill in the middle.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.970
It's like the memento. I'm pretty certain that I only briefly care about this,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:15.540
but I am curious workshop on web testing tools from a guy who is publicly allergic

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.460
to UI testing. I did not talk. I talked a little about UA animation, but it was about,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.740
It was about actual web testing tools, not UI automation, not automation.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.540
So what's a con...

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.340
So we spent a chunk of time at the beginning.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.860
So you didn't spend a lot of time on Selenium or things like that.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.620
We spent no time. In fact, let me come back to that because I am...

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.700
My rant level with UI automation is about to go through the freaking roof.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.400
But rewinding, flashback, da-da-da-da-da.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.800
I started off with some of my favorite Chrome plugins, Chrome extensions for web testing.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.400
Simple things like there's a web developer where you can turn off CSS elements,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.880
makes it easier to edit CSS and just going into source.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.640
I did go through showing people how to use developer tools.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.400
I think it's very important when debugging to know what things look like when they're working correctly.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.640
So if something's acting weird, if you go in and look at it and go,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.440
this doesn't look like it looked what it usually does, now I know it's wrong.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.000
It works on kernel debugging, application debugging, it works on web debugging as well.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.240
So we dove into that a little bit, showed them how to do performance,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.920
how to show the waterfall graph of page load times,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.960
understand where the time is being spent.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.840
Extensions like check my links, very handy for making sure that you're quick crawl

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.480
to make sure the links are correct and they actually go somewhere.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.000
Found some interesting issues.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.960
A few people found bugs in their websites,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.440
but some people found that if your site has a bunch of Twitter links,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.920
Twitter will throttle you for doing so many requests at once.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.200
Oh, yeah.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.760
You can start to fail some. I thought that was pretty cool.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.360
One of my school helps people understand how a little bit more how the web works.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.400
But go on.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.240
I was just going to share that one of my school projects

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040
a couple of years ago was on sentiment analysis,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.600
and I first started to do it via Twitter feeds and I hit that.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.310
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.270
So I also spent a reasonable chunk of time on Postman,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.970
and which was a lot of fun.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.210
You use Postman? You know what Postman is?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.850
So Postman is a...

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.850
You crazy kids and your new OSS tools for testing.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:31.210
So Postman makes it very easy for anyone to do or rest API testing.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.020
Oh, OK. So does it cover security concerns?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.940
Not directly, but I can't.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.780
We could do a whole episode on Postman.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.900
I won't. But the great thing was I had actually here's the weird thing.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.940
I had a full big room and I honestly asked them, what are you doing here?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.040
What were they doing there?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.680
And some of it has some legitimate reasons.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.920
And so we hung out. We talked. We did a bunch of things.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.400
But I asked them, how many of you do API testing?

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.380
Four hands go up.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.660
I say what tool do you use?

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.140
We use Postman, Postman, Postman, Postman.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.340
I mean, this is like 50 people in the room.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.100
Great. Let's all become API testers.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.180
And the great thing about Postman is you can just set it up from scratch

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.620
and put in a URL and a web request to start mucking with stuff.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.500
Look at an API we used, an app that someone wrote called Mark Winteringham

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.420
to be is his name of someone called Restful Booker,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.540
which is a little hotel booking app.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.220
Maybe it's hotel, some booking app.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.260
But take some rest APIs for your basic CRUD operations.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.590
And you can just start with nothing and explore.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.470
But the great thing you can do that can help accelerate the team

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.310
or accelerate a tester who may not know about web testing

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.350
is you can just configure a JSON file with some basics already set up,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.470
including some variables.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.270
So you'd like you want to type in the URL changes.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.710
You could just change it in one spot.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.550
So I gave him some JSON files from Danny Dayton.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.910
Again, a huge shout out to Danny Dayton, who's a huge Postman advocate.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.710
He and if you go to Stack Overflow and find questions on Postman,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.270
they're probably answered by Danny.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.150
But he's also posted on his GitHub, a bunch of utilities,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.230
tools, tutorials, and he has a couple of JSON files, which I just borrowed.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.550
I could have made my own, but his or I know his would work.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.430
And mine may not.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.870
Anyway, I give the class these JSON files and all of a sudden

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.550
they can actually start running API tests and then using their exploratory brains,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.710
because most of them are just manual testers most of the time.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.350
I shouldn't say just our manual testers most of the time.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.430
Now they can use that brain to go, OK, what happens if I do a start date?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.950
That's before an end date. What happens?

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.710
What happens if I for the more advanced kids?

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.150
There's a little programming interface you can use to it

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.870
and just a quick loop to create 4000 random bookings,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.410
which made the get call very slow for everyone in the class

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.770
because everyone's working at the same date.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.210
Right.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.250
So it was fun.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.250
So at the opportunity to show how the personal work was great.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.050
I could use those four people that had the API testing experience

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.490
to help other people out around them.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.610
And within a half hour, 40 minutes of this workshop,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.730
I went from having four people that I've done API testing

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.010
and kind of had the gist of it to 50 people who had done API testing

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.010
and knew the gist of it.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.200
We went over a few other tools.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.160
Did a little bit of security testing showing them Google

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.760
Greer to know how to do that, which is if you don't know that,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.800
it's just an application they built, which has it's a simple app

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.160
with a multitude of security issues,

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.740
but not like super easy to find like a lot of these testing apps out there,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.580
which are just totally broken.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.140
But you have to do a little bit of work.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.020
But people thought, oh, OK, I get how I get how easy it is

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.580
to break software security.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:47.150
So anyway, we crammed through it all in three and a half hours

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.710
with a 15 minute coffee break.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.830
And I haven't seen if they liked it or not, nor do I really care

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.830
because I had fun and I got lots of head nods where I wanted head nods.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.110
So I felt good about it.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.810
There it is in a nutshell.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.220
OK, so star east star east.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.300
I didn't attend very much.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.450
Wait, modern testing?

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.040
Question mark.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.960
Was there modern testing at star east? Yeah.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.920
I'm thinking of a word that rhymes with no.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.660
Oh, it's no. Yeah.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.340
I was thinking KNOW.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.460
Oh, that wasn't it wasn't a good rhyming word.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.380
Yeah. So not really.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:31.140
And I, to be clear, I think star is a great conference for newer testers.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.300
It's a great conference for people because they have so many tracks.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.660
It's great conference to break into if you're a speaker.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.780
It's a great conference for getting a lot of different knowledge.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.300
If you have enough basis to start using that to form your own opinion.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.820
But to the but the audience they cater to is mainly new testers.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.820
The speakers are mostly consultants trying to get business from new testers.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.620
And that's fine. That's their business.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.940
I'm nothing against that.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:03.220
But I didn't get a lot out of it other than meeting some people

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.380
that I hadn't met before and saying hi to some people.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.100
I was practically frustrated.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.660
And if you have a question to ask and then I want to share a few of my stories

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.300
before we go into the modern testing principles.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.780
No. My question will be a tangent.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.940
So go into your stories.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.450
All right. The opening keynote, which great content and very well presented.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.650
I forget the name of the woman who presented, but from a company called

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.570
I Sims and I followed her on Twitter.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.410
So I forgot the name.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.810
So I apologize if for some chance you're listening.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.930
But a great story on how she took her team of a combination of Estes

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.610
and manual testers, test developers and testers.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.730
I'll call them a titles piss me off.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.370
And how she had transferred her manual testers to learn how to write

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.480
automation for their team.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:02.980
Yeah. Yes. Again, not a I'm not a fan of the concept because it goes about 100.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.220
We have a whole new slew of you.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.180
I there's about 150,000 things that as a tester, I would love for you

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.660
to do with code before you thought about writing automation.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:18.620
But unfortunately, even before the talk, I heard a person behind me say,

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.340
and this is this part's literal.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.740
I might I might forget a word, but it's pretty exact.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.220
So I'm just a manual tester now, but I really want to get into automation

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.980
because that's kind of the way way to go. Right.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.700
I want to get into automation.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.780
And I hear that and I just might get sad inside.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.340
And Brent's going to puke a little bit.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:44.300
I go, oh, and as an industry, we it just hurts me that we preach to this so often.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.820
And again, I thought the presentation was really well done.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.980
But two big takeaways for me.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.920
One was it came out in a tweet from me.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.040
I said, wow, we all reflect.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.080
We can think about how much we've seen

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.040
talks and articles on getting testers to write automation.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.040
It's it's on every testers mind like, oh, I need to write automation

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.400
or I don't want to write automation and I don't want you to write automation.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.240
I want you to learn some code so you can write some tools

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.560
that will help you do much better testing.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.200
I don't want you to write automation.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.810
So the tweet was something to the to the effect of we seem to pull a lot of

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.970
there seem to be a lot of talks and articles on teaching testers

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.370
to write automation, but very little on teaching developers how to test.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.610
And the reactions to that were although while Brent's nodding his head,

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.210
yes, absolutely. And some people contributed to that.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.610
Modern testers would say, yes, absolutely.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:44.110
The pushback on I'm not surprised, but I'm saddened by how much it was.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.630
Well, developers shouldn't have to learn how to test because we have people

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.590
already who have special snowflake skills that allow them to test

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.430
and developers don't want to learn that, so they shouldn't have to yet.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.470
So I hear. Yeah, I hear comments like that all over the place.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.550
And, you know, I go back and forth when I hear comments like that,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.710
it depends on my mood.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.110
One one version of me will sit down with a person

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.140
and try to help them not screw themselves.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.590
And the other part of me is a firm believer in social Darwinism.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.500
I honestly believe and I get all the feedback

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.460
and I understand people are in different situations

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.060
in different contexts than we are.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.700
But I honestly believe that the direction software is going

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.180
and where there will be a tipping point soon.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.300
The majority of software companies, developers will be doing

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.300
the majority of the testing.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.860
And people will agree with me.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.060
People will disagree with me.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.700
People will say, no, no, they can't do the testing.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.180
I still get the shit about the up there with our explicit tag.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.380
I still get the shit about the mindset thing.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.180
Oh, developers can't learn how to test.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.020
They don't have the mindset for it.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.340
And for the last three years of my career, my life,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.700
I have been teaching developers how to test.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.100
And maybe I'm just in my own special little snowflake world.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.820
But what I've learned is guess what?

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.220
Developers can learn how to test just fine.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.940
And I'm just blown away by this whole mindset thing.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.420
Well, only testers have these skills they've honed their craft over a year.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.460
No, it's yeah, it is a bunch of.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.820
I'll just tell you, it's a bunch of wrapping.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.980
That that individual is put around themselves to justify their existence.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.940
And and if you tear off that wrapping, you're you're you're it's it is a threat.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.500
And I and so the really the way to convince these guys is like, no, no,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.900
I'm going to tear off the wrapping, but you'll be safe.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.140
You will. But you won't be safe.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.980
If you keep hiding behind this facade that you've convinced yourself of.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.860
Yeah, it really when I see the the the negative reactions

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:07.140
or the argumentative reactions, a lot of it comes from fear of you can't move my cheese.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.810
You can't take my wrapping off.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.290
So the worst.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.490
This is actually something this is a a brain Jensen

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.930
management philosophy that I teach.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.130
I need a theme song for that.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.130
But go on. Yeah.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.940
Where is it?

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.300
Where when mentees or employees come to me and you're like,

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.100
I don't understand why that person is doing that.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.620
I would never see them do that before.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.460
Like, this is not normally how they do things.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.540
So I am an amateur psychobabble list.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.580
Yeah, me too.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.740
I have spent a lot of reading on psychology stuff.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.580
Ditto. And done.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.340
Honestly, my unfair share of counseling myself.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.180
I for a long time at Microsoft, I called my job test therapist.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.130
No, I meant on the receiving it in this case.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:17:02.200
And there is a pattern that I've observed in that is when you see an individual

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.770
doing this particular pattern where they are, you observe them

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.900
and you go, they are totally self-destructing.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:22.950
It is 99 out of 100 times due to a fear

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:31.660
and their fight or flight thingy, amygdala is triggered.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.860
And the only way you can help them, they can't help themselves.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.180
If you see someone like this and even if you talk to them

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.580
and they speak rationally, they cannot help themselves.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.340
They are afraid and they're going to continue to do this.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.380
Now, one of the things that's worse about this is that when you fear.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.860
So we've talked about Myers-Briggs before.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.310
I'm not going to...

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.550
One of the patterns that Myers-Briggs has noticed

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:06.490
is that when you're stressed out, you switch all four of your letters

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.340
to the opposite side. Really?

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.340
I don't know if I buy that. I'll think about that for a while.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.460
So if you're a thinker, you start getting more emotional and go,

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.140
why does everybody hate me?

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.780
And if you're an introvert, you become more extroverted

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.740
because you're trying to figure out a clue.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.300
Now, what happens though...

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.460
I'm going to reserve judgment on that, but I'll let you continue.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.520
What happens though is because you switch to the other side,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.920
you start doing a catch-22.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.640
The stress causes you to switch,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.920
but now you're using the part of your personality

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.120
that you hardly ever use, so you don't really have the skills

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.440
to use that part.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.760
And that then creates this death spiral.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.870
Some of the studies actually think it's...

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.690
You switching is what causes the stress, but nevertheless.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.050
The useful advice is if you see someone like this,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.250
pull them aside, be a friend,

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.770
help them think because they are not.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.070
They're running out of fear.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.710
Yeah. Anyway.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.870
So anyway, I saw a lot of...

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.710
The tweet responses were...

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.070
I started replying to them.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.710
Some of them were...

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.750
The initial reaction was visceral.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.990
It's like, aah!

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.150
But then I just let them go because people...

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.550
Like you said, I can't change, especially over Twitter.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.990
I can't convince them that the world

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.900
is not changing around them.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.660
But I really push buttons with the UI stuff.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.140
The funny thing I see with the UI...

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.980
Every time I go off on why we have way too much

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.540
UI automation and way too much emphasis on UI automation,

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.180
the constant answer I get is...

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.380
For people who write UI automation, they say,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.340
yep, you're totally right, except in my case,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.860
we need to do it because.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.860
Except in my case, we need to do it because.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.740
Well, it's different for me.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.420
There's a bunch of snowflake world

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.940
that means we have these ice cream...

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.940
Agile doesn't work on enterprise shrink-wrapped products.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.980
I know what you're talking about.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.300
So anyway, that was my experience.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.140
It's a little weird.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.860
I ended up just doing a lot of work by myself.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.220
I met with a few people that I wanted to catch up with,

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.140
which was fantastic.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.160
But yeah, it's...

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.520
So before you lose hope.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.360
Here's the difference.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.200
Let me just throw this out there.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.040
All right.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.560
And again, nothing against Star.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.360
It's the right conference for a lot of people.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.320
That's probably the biggest test conference out there,

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.160
and it will remain to be.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.000
I think that's great.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.480
I love the people at Star.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.000
But as far as modern testing principles go,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.720
I was kind of blown away when I went to Test Bash.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.200
I talked about modern testing principles,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.640
thinking I'd freak some people out.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.200
And I had so many head nods,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.480
and so many people say,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.240
yep, that's what I'm doing.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.520
I would have been lynched at Star

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.830
for giving the modern testing talk.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.710
Oh, that is exactly the reason why to do it.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.710
Oh, one last thing I want to mention,

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.870
speaking of being lynched,

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.990
some of those so-called high-profile consultants,

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.810
it was weird.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.030
After the keynote, I was walking the hallway,

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.910
kind of just looking for a place to work,

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.740
and I heard more than one of them muttering about,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.720
complaining about that opening keynote,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.060
saying, teaching testers to write code,

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.940
that's just awful.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.340
They should just focus on testing.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.500
And, oh, they can't learn to code that quickly.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.860
They can't, this is just ridiculous, ludicrous.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.940
I won't give any names, but the usual suspects.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.780
And all kinds of absurdity,

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.320
because again, it's for the same reason,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.490
if testers grow their skills and get technical skills,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.450
whether they're automation

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.370
or actually valuable technical skills,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.370
it takes away from their business.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.650
Because their business is a threat.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.490
Yes.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.250
Right, it's a threat.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.130
But I don't give a crap, right?

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:06.130
Because there is a lot of people in this stuff

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:11.510
that are focused on doing the right thing,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.070
want to learn, like the millennials.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.930
You know what, I find it goddamn offensive

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.590
that Star East would be teaching the millennials

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.990
coming into the industry,

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.660
these freaking concepts from 30 years ago

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.740
that no longer apply.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.760
Now, so like, yeah, I could see going to Star East,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.740
that there's a chance that you would be lynched,

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.280
but only verbally, not physically.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.120
Right.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.440
And you know what, you can't convince someone to do this,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.940
but you can begin to open their eyes.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.860
Right, I had a Twitter with,

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.200
so a buddy of mine, Al Shalloway,

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.580
he is frustrated because he's not seeing a large,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.660
so he actually pushes the edge of Agile,

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.700
and he's seen all this effort we've done,

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.380
and there's still some of these key behaviors,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.520
the Agile community has not figured out

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:20.780
how to root out, like scrum and iterating only.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.300
Yep.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.140
Right, things like that.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.300
We just haven't figured out how to solve that.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.060
And I said, you know what, dude, I'm with you.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.340
Like you can lead a horse to water,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.860
you can show them how to drink water,

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.220
you can show them other horses

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.920
that have benefited from drinking water,

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.500
you can talk about the, whatever,

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.900
but you still can't make the goddamn horse drink.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.760
Right.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.600
And we can't, and all we can do,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.500
and that's one of the things I think about this podcast,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.480
this is why I come in.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.000
If every time one of the three refers us

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
to another new one of the three, right,

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.020
then that person begins, look, you know what,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.300
we're full of shit all of the time.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.100
We're just here to plant some seeds

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.100
and hopefully some sprouts of good ideas

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:13.920
grow out of them.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.320
And then help you control your own destiny.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.040
I can tell you, I agree with Alan,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.180
this tipping point is coming.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.880
The last survey, we still have to follow up with Joel,

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.720
but the last.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.800
I did check the website,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.680
since it's coming out very, very soon.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.520
Okay.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.640
The last series of surveys that we're seeing is, yeah,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.540
the business leaders are accelerating

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.120
towards understanding what they should be doing

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.440
in this space.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.000
And it agrees with us.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.840
I think so.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.520
Hey, speaking of the three,

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.680
we should probably do them a favor

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.440
and get started with the podcast.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.280
I agree.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.040
So over the next seven episodes,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.720
we are going to dive deeply into each

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.400
of the seven modern testing principles.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.240
Maybe more than seven, given the time

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.080
collected in this one.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.880
You can read those on moderntesting.org.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.660
I think this one is good,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.920
and I'll talk about why it is in a minute

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.920
after I read it to you.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.400
Again, moderntesting.org, if you want to read them all.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.880
But the first modern testing principle,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.720
which we'll talk about here

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.320
for the next 25 minutes or so is,

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.200
or maybe 20 after editing,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:28.130
is our priority is improving the business.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.130
I like that one.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.330
So I like it too,

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.610
but I didn't realize how much

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.110
until I started thinking about it

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.210
and taking a bunch of notes and writing about it.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.210
And I realized that,

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.710
I don't know if we did it on purpose

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.550
or how it worked out,

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:44.750
but I think the reason why I thought

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.570
that one was first,

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.990
but in many ways, the way you improve the business.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.820
We had a whole episode on that.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.060
You had it as number three.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.140
Do you have to drink and talk about this before?

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.980
So let me.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.530
No, but any chance I get to remind you

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.010
of how old you are?

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.410
I'm pretty dang old.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.130
So the way you do,

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.570
the way you improve the business,

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.470
the way you make that a priority,

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.960
is you execute on the remaining principles.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.360
So rather than talk about the other principles,

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.280
I wanna talk about what it means

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.240
to improve the business versus the task.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.560
So Brent, I'll ask you,

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.210
actually why?

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.470
Why is it important to improve the business?

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.810
Why is that an important principle for a modern tester?

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.210
My perspective on that is,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.880
the reason why a modern tester

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.720
and why focus on the business needs to be important

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.320
is because the modern tester

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.080
needs to be viewed as a positive contributor.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.920
Exactly.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.840
Not.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.960
And in addition to that,

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.160
the other reason why is people who are looking

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.160
at our work here and trying to decide what to do.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.820
I want them to have a sense

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.780
that that's their responsibility,

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.500
that that is the goal to achieve.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.500
How do I take my strengths, my assets,

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.460
and improve the business?

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.520
Not theoretically.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.360
None of this.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.850
So I think there's an important shift

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.230
from the traditional tester,

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.510
or maybe even the agile tester,

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.390
that modern testing wants to promote with this principle.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.990
And being a modern testing team would promote.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.070
We've traditionally seen test as a cost center.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.150
Test is a cost that comes at the end.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.630
We look at the ROI of testing.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.150
How much should we invest in testing?

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.170
That world is over in modern testing.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.010
Let me tell you a story.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.060
Testing, in one second.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.740
So I think the testing activity

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.340
adds to the value of the business

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.900
and we have ways to demonstrate what that value add is.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.300
By accelerating the achievement of shippable quality

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.580
and by add it, we do things to add value to our team

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.300
through testing efforts, through quality efforts,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.900
through acceleration efforts,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.840
where the value of doing testing on a modern testing team

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.220
is a value add for the product

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.840
instead of the traditional cost.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.780
So that's a huge shift.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.060
It is the pursuit, I love how you said that,

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:36.060
it is the pursuit of adding value to the business.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.300
I'm actually bouncing up on my channel.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.900
I'm so excited, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.940
So in not only that, but non-theoretically,

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.220
my very first blog post so many years ago

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.230
came after I had lunch with Alan, or not Alan, your Alan.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.110
Wait, who's old here?

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.910
Yeah, we both are, you're just slightly more.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.350
Whitaker, James Whitaker.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.590
The George Carlin of software testing.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.470
I completely agree, software engineering, I think it is.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:16.290
Now, he was, when we had this conversation,

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:22.010
he was in a test role at Microsoft, as was I,

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:27.010
and I was having a conversation with,

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.370
I was a middle manager then,

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.010
I was having a conversation with my,

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.050
this was back in the day when Pumps were still here.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:35.610
Those are product unit managers?

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.770
Yep, were.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.110
Were.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.490
And he noticed the behavior.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.220
He's like, you know what,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.160
I think we should just get rid of automation,

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.280
go back to manual testing,

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.760
because one of the things that he observed

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.330
was essentially every time I add a new rec

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.480
to work on automation, they come,

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.120
the team comes back and says,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.880
oh yeah, we weren't able to achieve the goal

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.080
because we need one more rec.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.800
So he concluded that automation,

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.280
and now this team was doing UI automation,

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.280
he concluded that automation was a black hole of payroll,

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.680
which by the way, I completely agree.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.520
Yes.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.050
V3.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:27.480
Yeah, now, but long, long, long story short,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.800
I took this and I said, hey,

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.410
I posted to James and I said,

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:41.700
hey, you know, have we figured out

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.510
what the ROI of test is?

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.510
Like if we figured out,

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.270
if I have 12 people on the team,

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.700
how do I articulate what the return

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.700
on the business's investment will be for the 13th person?

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.980
And, you know, I wrote this blog post,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.580
and James is really smart in the test business,

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.700
but neither of us had a really satisfying answer.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.960
His answer is, hey, you manager wants to know

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.000
what the ROI of test is, get rid of test,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.880
and then he'll see immediately.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.800
Now in those days, yeah, get where he's coming from, right?

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.760
But that was mostly,

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.840
it wouldn't have articulated an ROI of test.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.960
It's an ROI of a scapegoat or ROI of something else, right?

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.720
And if we got rid of the test team,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.240
you can't change a software engineering process

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.560
like that with a band-aid rip, right?

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.320
So yeah, it's gonna cause a lot of chaos,

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.040
but it's not because test is valuable,

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.880
it's because you changed the process.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.880
So let's see, let me, I wanna explore.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:59.080
But that theory around the ROI of test

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.040
is one of the reasons why the traditional view

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.520
of testing is broken.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.080
So let me take that model and go a little farther.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.320
Let's say we got rid of the test teams

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.440
who recognize the ROI.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.280
Yep.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.100
Everything you said.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.940
But Microsoft did that later when they said,

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.500
okay, there are no more testers, everyone's an engineer.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.520
And in many, many cases, they failed

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.040
because they didn't find a way

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.440
to make the testing activity a value add.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.040
They had a value deficit

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.600
because a lot of the quality things were just dropped,

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.400
and the value add to the customer failed to happen.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.320
Yeah, but remember, so famous quote from Edison, right?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.440
He learned 2,000 different ways

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.600
to fail to make a light bulb before he succeeded.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.280
There are places where you and I could argue that,

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.120
you know, like for example, there's a particular org

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.060
whose name rhymes with windows.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.260
Where what I observed is that they didn't learn

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:13.260
from the year plus of being executing this.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.160
Right, they decided it, which is something

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.960
that these large organizations do is like, oh,

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.800
you don't know what you.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.760
Absolutely, and then just to dive in,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.520
the reason why I think the modern testing transition,

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.920
I'm happy with the way it's going at Unity so far

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.560
is you're being very gradual and very purposeful

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.600
about shifting these roles

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.360
and making sure people understand things.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.400
A lot of teams, you know, Yahoo famously did it,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.400
but a lot of organizations at Microsoft did it,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.440
took no learning into account, just said,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.280
okay, it looks like that's what they're doing.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.120
We're gonna do this.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.920
So it'll just magically work.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.760
Now I wanna be super clear,

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.460
mostly because I don't want Steve Rowe emailing me.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.440
It's gonna happen now.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.280
Yeah.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.200
I wasn't privy to those discussions.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.080
This is what I observed as well as what I heard

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.680
from bits and pieces of others.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.160
You were in Windows at that time when the treasury.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.120
Unfortunately, yes.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.960
As was Steve.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.120
Although I think Steve was far more likely

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.080
to be connected to the business decisions.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.280
Yep, I was on the periphery in something

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.480
that was part of Windows because it used Windows,

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.760
but we were on the edge.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.720
But there are multiple places where I did not observe

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.100
them picking up with what I went through,

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.200
the Bing experience, and what I thought was

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.460
really useful learnings from that.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.920
In addition to that, I attempted to roll it out

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.370
on two other occasions in different orgs.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:46.080
And yeah, there's certain complexities there.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.820
Like you have to be able to answer the question.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.720
Hey, if Tess is no longer doing the unit test,

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.640
if I'm doing the unit test, what's Tess doing?

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.760
Right, things like that.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.200
So let me get back to the value thing.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.180
And I want to, I just realized I have a suggestion

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.640
for a future episode if you can find the right person.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.600
So I was briefly in the Office org,

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.480
which was my first Sanofsky-ish org.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.800
They'll think Sanofsky had already moved on

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.680
to Windows at the time.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.760
So they had a very, very, very carefully planned

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.920
waterfall model, which included very short coding milestones,

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.080
like in four to six weeks where you wrote the code.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.800
And then literally close to a year

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.480
of testing and stabilization.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.360
So in that case, the testing was a cost

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.340
that happened at the end.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.740
We tested quality into the product.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.940
Now again, on the periphery and the link,

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.620
and actually that length of time,

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:49.620
because they did the very short coding milestone,

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.670
I strongly suspect that what happened is,

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.550
hey, after this period, there's no coding

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.310
that everyone's testing.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:02.000
And so you see a phenomenon of, nope,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.200
I just have to get the skeleton in.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.560
I can actually implement it.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.640
There is famously a story in one of the Office apps,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.080
I believe word early on when they had to,

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.920
someone was given a task to write a function

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.040
to calculate the font, this is all paraphrased,

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.240
I've forgotten now, but calculate font height.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.360
So a coding milestone was almost done.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.400
So he wrote float, get font height,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.920
curly bracket, curly bracket,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.590
looked at the clock, looked at the calendar.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:35.040
Check in. Return 12, check it in.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.680
It was done, but it was buggy.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.560
So then he could fix it during the stabilization time.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:45.040
So that said, a team following modern testing principles,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.560
the Delta from idea to deployment is rapid.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.400
Yes.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.840
And that, so we wanna get just enough features,

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.600
get that MVP out with just enough quality

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.760
in order to get feedback from the customer,

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.400
which is so different from that other world,

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.040
but if we can accelerate that process, that's adding value.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.800
So we enabled the team to accelerate

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.400
the achievement of simple quality,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.680
and then we can get the value of that engineering effort,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.240
which Reese in Lean Startup says,

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.200
you don't get value from your engineering effort

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.800
until it's in the hands of customers.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.520
So we can accelerate that idea into customer's hand,

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.440
get the learning and loop and loop and loop and loop.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.640
That is how we add value to the business.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.520
I completely agree.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.840
One of the things that you bring up,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.480
we've talked about that's your job,

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.960
accelerating the achievement of shippable quality.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.240
But one of the things that I have found,

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.860
and I haven't come up with yet a cogent response,

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:47.550
because a lot of times I see people like in Twitter,

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:51.230
hey, Brent, this is absolutely fantastic, I love this.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.430
And then I see them using it

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:57.230
for what in my humble opinion is evil.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.630
Because it's just generic enough

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:03.470
that you could perhaps encapsulate it

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.790
into what you're doing and use it to justify

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:06.990
what you're already doing,

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.310
even though what you're doing is wrong.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.470
And one of the things I wanna call out

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:12.710
that you just mentioned,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.790
you can ship before you've achieved shippable quality.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:20.630
Of course.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.390
Right, so if you get an MVP out,

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.230
see if anyone actually even cares,

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.960
ship it with bugs, knock yourself out.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.720
But you have to be able to react to it.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.800
Yes, you have the kind of being ready for that loop.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.840
Reminds me of the story when getting ready

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.760
for the team's launch.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.120
And everybody's freaking out like,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.960
oh, November 12th is the, or whatever the date was,

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.400
November sometime.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.440
You know, oh, we gotta be ready,

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.320
we gotta do the right things.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.120
And everybody's freaking out about that day.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.560
And I'm sitting there going, okay,

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.280
yep, that day's coming, that's not an issue.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.800
How do I make sure we set ourselves up to be ready

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.760
for the release a week later?

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.880
And the week after that.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.360
And the week after that.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.440
Modern testers, if I may call myself one,

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.720
or a team attempting to follow a modern testing principles,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.720
are thinking about that loop way ahead of time.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.120
Like, it's not just getting it out there,

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.200
but how do I react from that and then take the learnings

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.440
and make that do a better experience for the customers?

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.880
And that's a value add.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.200
I do, I think actually one of the big things

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.760
someone in this space can do that would add great value,

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.760
I just brought up the Scrum and Iterations fallacy.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.840
I actually heard this in one talk at Star

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.520
before I left, something to the effect of,

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.920
I was working, I looked up and made a face,

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.360
a little vomit in the throat thing.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.440
So the effect of, so we decided we needed to be agile.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.000
So we planned out all of our Scrum Iterations

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.120
and then we documented them and executed on that process.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.010
I just made Brent.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:02.010
I cannot tell you how many times

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.330
I have heard something like that.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:08.090
And how many times, I mean,

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:13.320
Alan and I, we like to be on the leading edge of ideas.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.840
And so a lot of the times I forget

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.840
that what is like a frickin' decade old concept to me

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.880
is still new to other people.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.600
And I just get so, I'm like, God damn it,

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.480
I have been correcting people on this for years.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.840
Why has this not stuck?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.720
Please, please, if you're listening

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.560
and you're one of the three, please tell your friends,

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.720
tell your neighbors, tell everyone you work with

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.720
that agile and Scrum are about being able to adapt.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.200
Iteration is a method, it is not the goal.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.480
People are so focused, people get so focused on iteration

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.720
as, look, we're iterating, we have six weeks Brents,

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.720
we have whatever.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.640
It's iteration is not the goal.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.880
We iterate in order to be able to adapt.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.600
If we're not adapting, you're doing it wrong.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.000
I am mindless agile robot, I must iterate.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:14.900
Gah!

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.640
But now therein lies the opportunity for modern testing.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.640
There is value in using customer data, customer telemetry.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.840
I am a huge proponent of if you can do this,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.680
do the minimum amount of testing before you ship.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.720
Cover the catastrophic scenarios, other security issues.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.120
As long as you want to ensure that you can get the learning,

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.760
like you have the right analytics in place,

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.640
you have the right monitoring in place.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.520
If you do that, yeah, do the minimum amount of testing,

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.080
get the value.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.080
If you have a telemetry stack, guess what?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.400
There is no one who tests your product better

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.840
than your customer, get it out.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.480
I fully endorse this comment from Brent Jensen.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.580
And now, where modern testing comes into play

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.260
and where the pursuit of quality,

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.380
that's what I'm gonna call it right now.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.540
It's the pursuit of quality.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.300
Quality is a problem solved for the customer.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.660
So when we ship a small release,

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.840
I think it's the modern testers job

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.920
to go and look and say, which of these things are working?

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.480
Which of these things aren't working?

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.880
Where are we seeing usage?

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.720
What are the bugs?

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.560
How do we fix that?

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.560
Right, so in this case,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.560
I'd love to see the modern testing community

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.160
looking at this telemetry

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.720
with the intent of maximizing the reduction

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.810
of actual customer paint, not theoretical.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.970
Again, you still have to validate the catastrophic.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:04.910
Still a bad idea to ship a software with a bug

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.070
that could cause data loss.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:07.910
Absolutely.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:12.910
Still a bad idea to ship a product that has security issues,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.110
that will expose credit card numbers.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.630
These are still very bad ideas.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.630
But the number of cases that fall into this

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:24.110
versus the number of cases that traditionally fall

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:29.110
in a traditional test teams suite is tiny.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.010
Now, one thing I also wanted to bring up

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.880
because we were talking about what's broken.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.120
And we kind of hinted on it,

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.320
but the other thing that's broken

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.150
about the traditional approach

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:46.240
is not only is it a cost, but it's a delay.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.360
So let's talk about that.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.320
I was thinking about this from,

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.200
not just that point in general.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.960
I was thinking about what would it be like

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.120
if the principle is to,

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.920
is that our priority is improving the business.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.480
What would it be like

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.110
if our job was to unimprove the business

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.550
or make the business worse?

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.990
And oddly, the answers I came up with

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.910
line up with some traditional premises.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:13.750
Let's say for example, if-

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:14.830
Bug bashes.

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:17.110
We hire a hundred people to do nothing

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.630
but file a bunch of bugs

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.350
that then the dev team has to spend their entire team

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:24.710
to do the triage.

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.430
There's a good example.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.270
Maybe.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.150
And especially if those bugs aren't bugs.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.150
There are bugs that customers care about.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.070
And the customers will find the latter case.

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.150
How many test teams have you been on?

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:39.310
And maybe fewer of these than Microsoft.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.670
I'm guessing the answer is going to be all of them.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.590
Where the test team is the gatekeeper

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.390
and they have to sign off on the product,

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.510
hence have the ability and power

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.590
to delay the product from shipping.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.040
Saying no, it's not ready yet.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.880
So rather than get things to them quicker

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.840
to get learning, we say,

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.040
no, it can't ship because we want to fix these bugs.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.520
Actually, I was wrong.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:04.910
In the end-

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:08.630
Very few in my actual experience, right?

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.630
Because the biggest problem in my experience that I had

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:20.450
was no, we were accountable for signing off

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:24.450
but we were not given the power to extend the date.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.050
The ship date was given to us in all cases.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.310
Right.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:29.670
We can also, another thing we can do

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:31.070
rather than accelerate the team,

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:34.910
we can make the team resist change.

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.910
Which, going back to our earlier discussion

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.590
from before the modern testing principle-

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.750
Based on what you just discussed at SIRIES,

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.270
it seems like that's already covered.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:45.190
If you dig in your heels and say, nope,

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.150
this is the way we're doing it, no need to change,

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:52.200
you are actually costing the company money.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.230
If you are unwilling to change and unwilling to advance.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.790
Because-

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:02.420
Let me give you a concrete example.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.820
You can't, what the hell?

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.790
You can't teach dev how to test.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.500
We should resist that.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.340
All right?

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.210
Now explain how it's costing the business.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.490
The back and forth between, from bugs,

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.850
from basic bugs going from developers to testers.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.930
When the developer gives us this code

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.530
and it just doesn't work, I have to give it back,

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:24.890
we go back and forth.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.610
It's a delay, it takes time and time and time.

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.970
If we work together, and I can help them learn to test,

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.970
I'll pair with them, I'll help them out.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.890
But if the developers are writing some short tests,

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:39.410
they run on every check-in or every change,

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.450
they can get a lot higher quality code to me

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:44.090
in the first place, so I can be better at finding

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:46.330
the bugs that matter the most to customers.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:48.170
That will accelerate our ability

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:52.150
to get higher quality code to our customers.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.150
I have positive news on this one.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.390
Do you have kids that have gone

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:57.590
through a programming class yet?

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.870
Both my kids have learned how to write games in Unity.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.510
Okay, but had they gone through formal training?

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:03.870
No. Okay.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:08.070
So one of the things that I have observed is actually,

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.270
so my son's in AP Computer Science right now

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.710
in high school.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.510
This is a concrete example.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.350
He has to write unit tests.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.430
He's graded on it as part of it.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:21.910
That is wonderful.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:24.310
A lot of the millennials coming out of school

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:26.520
are very similar, right?

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.680
So I actually, I think-

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.520
The new world.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.880
I think unit testing and TDD.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.480
So on that particular front,

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.090
that particular comment that you heard is series,

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.330
I think it's gonna rapidly decelerate.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:45.200
And when these blind people who aren't paying attention

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.640
to how the world has changed,

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.000
when they finally die off,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.040
this won't be a problem for society.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.400
So let me, we're just about out of time here.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.520
I wanna see if I can summarize

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.960
what it means to improve the business.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.600
I think in the short term,

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.480
we accelerate the achievable quality.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.400
The goal is to get value to customers frequently.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.520
But in the longer term,

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.280
as we'll explore in the coming weeks,

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.320
it's making sure the team follows

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.230
the remaining modern testing principles.

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:15.070
That's a good summary.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.840
I would also wanna call out,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.720
we believe, and hopefully we articulated it.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.180
We'll see what the feedback is.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.520
But we actually believe that

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.760
the traditional testing approach

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.000
at this point in time harms the business.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
It harms the business by creating delays.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.180
It harms the business by creating costs.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.200
And that's, maybe it ends up being a quick litmus test,

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.040
at least maybe unmeasurable,

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.280
but ask yourself, is the work I'm doing,

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.770
am I adding cost to the business or value to the business?

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:51.170
Is that, that could be a litmus test

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:52.850
for being a modern tester.

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:55.810
Or is my team following modern testing principles?

00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:00.230
And it is far too theoretical.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.710
I said unmeasurable, yeah.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:05.570
Yeah, and they've,

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:09.170
the traditional testing has refused to measure

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.570
not only risk, but ROI on their efforts.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.700
Absolutely.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.980
And then dysfunctionally,

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.840
we complain that no one understands the ROI of test.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.680
Because you haven't explained it.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.320
And I think actually that's part of the problem

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.440
with the traditional approach.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.280
Yeah, and that's why a lot of companies see it

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.760
as just a cost you pay at the end.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.680
It's the cost of shipping.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.440
I have to pay X amount of money

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.320
at the end of my product cycle to get,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.480
I won't even call it achievable quality,

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.110
A level of quality.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:43.700
Yes, so first litmus test from principle number one,

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.140
if you wanna call yourself a modern tester,

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.020
you need to be able to concretely articulate

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.460
either the current value or the future value

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.980
of your efforts to the business.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.820
Yeah.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.180
If you cannot do that,

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.740
you have not yet passed the test for principle number one.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.700
Okay, all right.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:05.940
This was fun.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:06.780
This was a lot of fun.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.620
I can't wait until the next time

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.380
we'll do the second principle.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.300
Again, you can read those at moderntesting.org.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.140
But I had a good time today, Brandt, how about you?

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:16.980
I did too.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.700
I got you to get pretty frustrated and yell,

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.080
that was awesome.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.210
Yeah.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:23.850
All right, Brandt's sad now, but hopefully have a good day.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:25.530
Thank you very much for listening.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:26.370
I'm Alan.

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:27.210
I'm Brandt.

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:28.030
We'll see you next time.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.870
Bye.
