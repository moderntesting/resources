00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.260
Hi, it's Alan and Brent and we're here again for the night time.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.260
Number nine, number nine, number nine.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.020
Walking out of the last podcast, I was thinking that, oh, and I'm glad you remembered.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.020
Speaking of the last podcast, it's not posted yet. So we're probably going to post eight and nine

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.010
fairly close to each other. That sure.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.250
Sometimes it's still on average every two weeks. It's been pretty good. And it takes

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.050
take some time to go through and kind of get it already and make the edits.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.530
And, you know, my family left town. Yep.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.250
I've been, you know, I should be like goofing off, screwing around,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.810
but I've been working a whole, whole lot. Long, long days.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.570
It's interesting how when your family goes out of town,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.940
you no longer have an excuse to avoid doing work.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.060
Well, I totally, I totally wanted to have what is commonly known as short timer syndrome.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.900
Knowing I was going to be not at work for two months, I thought I'm going to ease into that

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.860
because and to make it worse, my boss is on vacation this week.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.860
So I could totally have taken an extra week off.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
Yeah. But but instead what's happening is well, I'm guessing. Let me guess.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.460
Yes. Holy crap.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.820
Alan's gone. How do we compress all this shit that we wanted him to do over the next two

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.660
months into one week? No, no, no, actually that wasn't it at all.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.180
It's me being kind of stupid, but not stupid. I there was a project needed to be done.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.770
And I thought I can take care of this because I can get it.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.050
We'll get it done before I go. It's doesn't everybody else can focus on their day job.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.090
It's it's contained. I can do it by myself.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.930
And then the project turned to be much more complicated than I thought it was going to be.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.500
And what what it is is I've learned a lot. Brent some time ago asked me how I would interview

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.860
people for my team. You know, if I wanted to, you know, what qualities you look for if

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.340
you're building an engineering team. And one of the big things is just people that can learn new

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.740
things. And that's kind of my, you know, one of my powers is like, here's something I know

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.340
nothing about, but I'm happy to go do it because I can figure stuff out pretty well.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:33.250
And what it was is my team uses Git for source control and it's Git hosted in Microsoft team

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.970
Foundation server. And we have a dozen or so repos that make up our product.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.090
Why do you use Git and not TFS itself?

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.570
Lots of reasons. I'll tell you the two biggest ones why we use Git.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.250
And one that has been a huge advantage to me.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.220
Git is actually probably the biggest one is I'm gonna talk about the biggest one.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.110
Cause I don't know all the details behind all the decisions, but stack overflow.com

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.510
is the best source of information for Git ever, everything ever and into have gotten partial

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.510
answers or not complete answers from stack overflow. There just aren't as many because

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.070
there's so many people using it. And so it's really great. It's nice to use something that

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.350
a big chunk of the software engineering world is working with.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.330
So anyway, so I think that's probably a good reason to use it. And then, uh,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.290
so what you're saying is, is there's a large knowledge sharing community around this.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.210
And then somewhere farther up the chain, there's a move to get our entire organization

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.530
larger than my group moved over to get eventually. And we're kind of, uh,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.930
making the pilot, the pilot move there.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.000
Does, does Dev Dev know about this?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Yes. Dev Dev is worth dev.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.470
Dev Dev thing to know is, uh, team foundation server has native get support in it.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.430
It supports source control, either via a team that they're old, whatever the old source

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.070
controls called or Git. It works really well.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.240
Awesome. So, so I didn't know about this feature. So what they're saying is that

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.120
they have an extensibility model is like, Hey, our, our, we want to be the,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.280
the broker between common developer activities.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.600
And the thing to remember with Git is, Git is, um, distributed version control.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.430
So everybody has a copy of the repo. I can't go and explain all the details of Git now. So it's,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.390
you can do pretty much everything without pinging the server. You only ping the server when you

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.110
want to update your, uh, current files or to push what you have to the server.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.550
You can change branches. You can do, you can, uh, do pretty much everything else just locally.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.310
So the offline experience is fantastic.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.150
Is there any issue? Does that mean they have to have a clone of the, the depot on every box?

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.790
Yeah. Okay. So, so we, so like 70 petabytes,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.350
um, the, it will never go there because nobody, we, nobody is stupid enough to check in binaries

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.790
to get its source control. Okay. Not, not, not binary control.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.470
Cause binaries are really crazy there. Anyway, not a Git, not a Git lesson today.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.540
We're going to stop there. We wanted to move from one, uh,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:23.070
TFS hosted Git to another server with, uh, actually for source control itself, very, very easy.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.770
Um, it's, it's amazing how easy it is because distributed how easy it is to move where it's

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.890
hosted. Um, I can get everything moved over. It doesn't even look like I touched it, but it's,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.210
so my name doesn't show up like, you know, Alan touched everything, you know, in our traditional,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.090
uh, source controls, source control systems have used at Microsoft.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.970
If the person with the most check-ins, it's almost always the guy in the, uh,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.010
in the, in the build team who's doing all the integrations. But the thing I loved about Git is

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.130
I can do all this moving around and keeping things up to date. My name doesn't show up because I'm

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.450
just shuffling things around. History goes with it, but I'm, I have no part of it. Anyway,

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.530
that's cool. So source control move is easy, but, um, is that, is this the project that you've

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.920
been working on? Yeah. Okay. So anyway, that part's easy, but we had also hooked up a bunch of,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.760
here's where it gets a little complicated and a little bit more often to the weeds.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.920
We had, uh, we used the TFS builds as well. So our code is built for us in the cloud,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.680
but not really in the cloud because we hooked it up to it on premise and build controller,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.520
which you can do. Now we're getting deeper into the weeds and, uh, a lot, our unit tests

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.320
actually run for all our components run right after build right now. Cause we're starting up

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.750
and this will be in the longterm working this way, but they run on that server. Okay. And I,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.230
there was some great documentation, how to set up a new build controller. Cause I had to set

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:54.860
up a new build controller and the documentation was about 90% done yet deemed complete. So I

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.060
found things like, Oh, I got to install this on the server. Oh, and I found, um, this will,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.700
this is interesting. So it's been, I've been neck down trying to get builds to work, um,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.180
and try and replicate that other server on the new server. I've been taking a bunch of my time.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.940
I think we're pretty much over the humps now. It's good. There's a different, all kinds of

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.780
little things that were different. I had to deal with, I wrote this really cool, uh,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.220
PowerShell script. Oh God. I want to get into this. Um, I want, I want to, I want to explain

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.580
why, but it actually reads, this is, um, pure hack, but I put a big smile on my face when

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.180
it worked. Um, I had to create a security group, uh, V a VSO security group that had

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.180
everybody on the team except for a few. So, so I had a blacklist, a blacklist and I give

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.420
deny access on one of the branches to that list that doesn't include to the people. So they're

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.900
on cause deny overrides and now I'm explaining everything anyway. So I wrote this thing that

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:56.450
reads from, uh, uh, active directory and gets the members of the distribution list, uh, of the

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.690
full team takes the distribution list that has the people that are white listed,

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.570
removes those from that list and then writes the resultant list to a VSO security group.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.850
So I've been using a lot of PowerShell. So I spent fun to learn that just, uh,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.410
new stuff to learn. It's been great. Uh, getting everything working is been a little bit of a

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:21.730
pain, but it's, it's getting there, but taking a ton of my time. So that's what I've been doing

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:27.810
on my pre summer break instead of just, you know, goofing off. But I think we may, it's funny.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:33.780
Yesterday, uh, I sent mail cause I was actually feeling some anxiety because I have like, I still

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.380
have like packing to do, I have a little shopping to do. I have to clean the house. I have to,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.340
actually in the middle of all this before I leave next Wednesday, have to leave town for

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.580
a couple of days to go see my dad before I leave. And I'm looking at everything I have to do. And

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.500
then the damn tire light came on in the car and going, and there's a bunch of stuff I need

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.860
to, my wife gave me to bring back to the store and going crap. What am I going to know what it's

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:57.600
done? So I'm actually, uh, freaking out a little bit, which is not my normal thing.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.200
So yesterday I, uh, I sent mail to our, our dev director. I said, look, I'm about throwing the

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.480
towel. Here's where we are. These things aren't working yet. Um, I'm, I'll send you a status

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.320
later tonight. And it was funny, just the act of me sending that mail saying that I'm freaked out.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.640
So we're going to throw in the towel. And the only thing stopped me from throwing in the towel

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.200
is I just feel bad about now I have to transfer the remaining work to somebody else and have them

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.440
babysit the move and make sure that the else goes crazy. Yep. So I was feeling bad, but as soon as

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.240
at the mail with the option that, Hey, I'm going to not worry about this anymore. Um,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.480
the anxiety went away and made a little more progress. And as of last night, um,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.680
it looks like we're back on track to make them to get it done this weekend.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.680
It was a little bit of babysitting tech support, uh, early next week. And then we should be good

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:52.580
to go, but it's been crazy. Has he giving you someone to hand off to? Uh, not directly,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:58.900
but, um, we both know who it is. So anyway, this project, I thought I'll just, that'll be

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.820
fantastic stuff. I'll do, I'll learn. It'll be fun. It's been a great learning experience,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:08.290
a little bit of high stress work. And, uh, but it's, I think it's all under control. I haven't

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.490
checked my mail in the last, since I've been on this 10 minute diatribes.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.010
But crazy. Anyway.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:22.050
Yeah. It's one of those things. So if, if you were an employee on my team and you sent me that message,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:31.140
you would have two other people to help you immediately because I, I, I do not like things

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.740
not done before vacation. Cause one of the things that I'm a big believer in is that ticket is

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:44.500
always flowing forward. And we, every ticket on, on my team's board has to be done in two weeks or

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.380
less. And so if it's not done, or it's not risk of being done, then I need to get other people

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:55.300
aboard. Cause I do want you to go on your vacation and, and not have to look at email.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.580
Um, and I want the project to continue going forward. Yeah. I think there's this, this

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:07.360
weird feeling that, Oh, Alan has it under control. Cause I usually do even when I, but then when I

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:14.740
don't, that they don't believe me. Yeah. You kind of got this, um, you're, you're the,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.840
the boy who never cries wolf. Maybe I can do it myself.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:27.070
So one thing I forgot to mention, um, I forgot the punch line and all this. So we use a couple

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:33.790
of our repos use, uh, get sub modules. Don't I'll explain it to you later. Anyway. Um, they're

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:40.270
really, they behave really frequently and moving them is interesting because, uh, that there's a parent

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:46.430
module contains this pointer to the sub module and you have to update it without really updating it.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.950
And it's crazy, but, um, so I searched, I searched the web on, you know, get sub modules,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.990
a lot of great questions and answers on, um, PowerShell command. No, get some sub

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:03.150
modules are part of get, um, but there are, I came across when I searched for get sub modules.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:08.750
If you do it, you'll see all kinds of articles on why get sub modules are evil, you know,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:14.510
why our company doesn't use get sub modules. And I know I didn't read, I didn't have time

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:20.100
to read the articles, but I know why they write them. So how many of our five listeners

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:27.940
are using it? I don't know. Okay. They've all shut off now. So, so Brett, I'm going to ask you this

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.980
first. Maybe I'll answer it afterwards, but I'm going to be gone from next Wednesday until

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.900
sometime after the first of September, like September 4th, 5th. I can't remember. Um,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.200
a lot of changes going on lately. What does the world look like? Do you think what, what,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.920
when Alan comes back to work after ignoring work for two months,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.120
or ignoring pretty much software world for two months, when I come back, what are some things

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.280
I go, wow, that change really happened fast. It's a big change that they left. Or do you think it

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.800
will be, it's only two months. It'll be all the same. It's, it's, it's interesting. When I,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.820
when I try to think through it, there is a, um, we, we often talk about these, these, uh,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:17.340
two divisions in our company, uh, both primarily execution focused. I think when you come back,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:24.260
one of them will have flipped the switch. And I think right in that time, uh, you'll, you'll

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.820
come back right in the, the crazy time where everyone's running around like headless chickens

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:34.820
going, ah, they just did this. I don't know why. Right. So there'll be a lot of, uh, podcasts

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.020
fodder around the question why it again. Yeah. So you should start building up a,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.100
just take a little like one note, no putter and notepad and, and just, uh,

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:50.420
keep a long list. We'll prioritize in September. I'm thinking, I'm thinking we could just print

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.980
out the transcript of episode two or three or whatever it was, and then just read it. But we

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.260
could do it like with, with pirate or British accents or something and just repeat it all over

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:06.740
again. That's not even funny, but, uh, it kind of reminds me of you seen, um, uh, is it Fallon?

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.180
Who has the people read their, read the mean tweets about them? Oh, that's, um, Kimmel. Kimmel.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:18.180
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, we could just, if you would all our five listeners, if you'd all just

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:24.340
tweet mean things about us, Brent and I will read them. Absolutely. Yeah. Um, the one thing though,

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:32.860
that, that was interesting. I ended up, um, talking with a few folks from your old neck of the woods,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:41.150
also mine, the Xbox org. Oh yeah. And, um, the most common question that I've been getting

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:47.630
is, yeah, windows isn't really going to go with this for a while, right? So we're, we're protected.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:56.990
And I'm like, okay, first off, this concept of protected kind of bothers me. You really,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:04.670
you shouldn't be, you should be diving all in and forcing through this quote unquote wall of

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:12.110
having spent two years in Xbox. Um, there is, uh, a strong culture of, and this is, you know,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:18.500
whether it's good or bad, it is up for debate, but a strong culture of we're different. So leave

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:28.140
us alone. Yes. We're not like you to leave us alone. Right. And the thing I, I burst their bubble on.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:39.280
I'm like, no, uh, windows windows core. Yeah. They'll take, oh, they won't be on this. Um,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.760
when you come back, not yet, but there will be a lot of teams. What is the name of that group now?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:56.240
Asg, osg. What's the whole windows division? Oh, osg. There will be a large number of teams within

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.880
that division that will have executed this. And what's this again? The, the, the culture

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.360
changes that are happening, the stuff that we listed off, I don't, I don't think it'll happen.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:15.330
I think osg will be the, honestly, the last last organization to really figure this out.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:23.860
They'll be the last to finish, but there will, there, there are already, um, teams within osg

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:31.550
that are starting as best as I can tell is that they're, they're going through the teams where

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:40.030
it seems like there's little risk to, um, for lack of a better, the little risk to the bottom line

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:47.870
by engaging that switch. All right. We'll see. And I see what I told those guys is I, I see no,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:54.260
I see nothing about Xbox that will insulate them from this. No, I don't see that either,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:59.490
but I, I just, I think we can go back and forth on this. But when I come back,

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:07.390
my hunch is, and maybe I'm just feeling cynical is that I will see lots of groups of big changes

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:14.780
and going on and I will see little change in, uh, osg outside of my, our team were,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:20.620
we're different. We're insulated. No, uh, we're under the osg umbrella, but we're not like

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.860
anything there, which I think say that I don't know if that keeps us protected, but we are,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.980
we may make some huge, big changes. I could, I could totally see coming back in two months

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.660
and having engineering managers and engineering teams versus a slight discipline ownership that

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:45.790
we have. I have just hit my first conversation with a, uh, a leader from, from that group

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:53.470
who, who communicated to me that the discussions around the, the quality org that, that was formed

00:17:53.470 --> 00:18:05.970
up six, nine months ago, right? Um, doing the next step of the change. So in a nutshell, uh,

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.990
kind of getting rid of the quality orgs. Yeah, it's interesting. So, um, when we set up our

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:18.430
quality org, our test org, we, one thing we did, which is, I can't remember why we did it,

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:25.150
but I'm happy we did it is we don't have, um, our quality org does different, we don't do any

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:31.310
automated testing. We're doing some instrumentation analysis, end to end, you know, uh, long tests,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.110
which I guess could be automation, but more stress and load, uh, making sure we have deployment

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:43.470
systems, testing, production, et cetera. Our dev org is set up. We have, uh, dev managers who own

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.110
functional parts of the product. I won't go into all the pieces, but they own functional pieces.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:57.310
And we have our, our quality managers own some scenario areas or, or, or data analysis. What that

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:02.910
means is there's no peer in the old world. There was a dev manager and they had a matching test

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:09.710
manager, right? And, and, you know, they knew who to go, Hey, help me test this. Our org is set

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.840
up now where that doesn't exist. And it's fine because our devs are writing all the functional

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.920
tests and we're looking at things from a bigger picture. But I thought about this,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:25.310
and the fact that we don't line up at all means you could just as well call us an engineering team

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:34.380
and give us all one title or, or, or whatever, and then run it the same way. That's exactly.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.820
So that's so we are, we're, we're, we're basically an engineering team with titles in these loose

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:45.500
walls. It's a nice, I realized it wasn't planned this way, but it's a nice, we're set up well for

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.060
a transition. I mean, you could come in tomorrow and say, you know what everybody you're going to

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:56.380
keep on doing the same thing, but it doesn't make sense to give us all different titles and to,

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.900
and to set up any sort of artificial walls organizationally. We're going to shift some

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.140
leadership positions around to make it make sense, but keep doing the same work. But

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.810
we're going to change. We're just going to change some trivial bits around the outside.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.440
Yes and no. I mean, if you guys have already formed up that you're sort of,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.130
so these, these, these other engineering orgs, the orgs that you call the dev orgs today, right?

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.850
Are they your customers? Are they your partners? How do they interact with your team?

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.770
We do different work. Entirely different work.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:39.250
Not we're all working on software. And, and the same software, right? Well, maybe. And I

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.970
guess the difference is we're working mostly on the meta software, working on, we're working

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:50.610
on software that tells us about the product. They're working on the actual implementation of the product.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:57.980
Okay. So you're producing a bunch of knowledge about the product. Who takes action on that

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:06.380
knowledge? I'm thinking it depends on the knowledge. Right. And I imagine a non-trivial

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:12.130
amount of that is the actual dev org. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Right. So they're essentially your

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:22.500
customers. I don't like that statement. Too bad. All right. Go on. No, why do you not like that

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.620
statement? You would rather view yourself as isolated from them? No, I don't want to be isolated

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:34.020
from them. I don't know if when we're better together, we're one Microsoft. That's a great

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:39.600
cliche, but actions is what lines that up and makes it true. Them being our customers,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:47.140
is like one step away from saying we're service providers for the team. And that even bristles

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:55.200
my hair a little bit farther. Okay. But your hair bristling doesn't make it not true. Maybe,

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.240
maybe. Anyway, you have a point buried under your questioning, so get to it.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:05.600
I may have gone into the weeds. One of the, so that's exactly how my team is organized now.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:14.720
So what you would call the quality org, I kind of frame it as sort of the systems org, but not

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:21.920
systems as in the BS system test team that we used to have 15 years ago, but more of sort of

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:29.440
the system end to end where the guys whose job it is figure out how everything integrates in terms of

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.340
the, the behavior of the system and the behavior of the customer. And,

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:43.140
but so we're also producing a lot of knowledge, but the whole point of that knowledge production

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.340
is it has to be produced in a timely enough fashion along with the correct actions so that

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:55.070
the correct actions can be taken, which, which basically in my view makes us one of the most

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.390
critical pieces of the whole division. Cause you have a whole bunch of people,

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:08.480
generally focused on getting their own stuff done, right? Their, their, their expertise is,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:15.870
I know how to build this streaming engine as an example, right? And not necessarily have the,

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:22.190
there's this term called cognitive limitations. Humans, unfortunately are only able to remember

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.600
and number of things in that N is very finite and mine's right around three.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:39.730
The, so when they're knee deep in their code, they're thinking about their bugs and they're

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:45.410
thinking about their definition of done around this, this new code quality and whatever test

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:50.290
cases they need to be done or need to be done, but they're not necessarily thinking through,

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:55.730
okay, once this is done, how do I prove that this has added any value? How do I fail fast?

00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:02.850
How do I stop? How do I enhance the value that, that my code's doing? How do I stop it?

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.650
How do I make sure that what I just did didn't integrate or didn't fail to integrate with that

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:14.450
team that, that is in an entire different building that I hardly ever talked to, right?

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:19.970
That's where you sort of need this, this, I don't even like calling it the quality team,

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.330
but that's how you frame it. That's, that's the value proposition.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:31.840
I didn't make the call. Yeah. I liked calling it the quality team. The, the, the problem is

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:38.830
we're still not focused on actual quality. There's still this big battle that quality means bugs.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.090
And I'm really looking forward to the day that that, that definition dies.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.020
A lot of people put air quotes, I put an air quotes up here on the podcast,

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:56.100
but air quotes around quality team. Well, the quality team does blah, blah, blah. And, uh,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.220
I think that's one of the problems without, not just the name, couldn't call it quality or test

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.020
or whatever, whatever what you do. But one of the problems in giving, having separate teams

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.460
to work on the same software in different angles causes a sort of air quotes to go

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:19.180
around there in that mystery. Yeah. And, and momentum will move in the direction that people

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:25.280
are used to unless there's something that, that triggers that change. So when you, when you frame

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.040
yourself as a quality team or you staff up something like this, as that says, no, we're

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:39.860
an engineering team, but 90% of your org is X test. So aren't you just another test team? No,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:46.100
we are another engineering team. Right. Um, well, and just going back to my original story, this is,

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.820
I, I doubt it's something that's typical for that's something that a typical tester would go do.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.090
The build stuff to go, to go fix up the, the source control move and the build stuff. I

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.530
don't know if a tester would typically do that. I don't think it matters on,

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.970
and nobody on our team had any trust issues made doing that. I said, Hey,

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.690
I'm going to give you guys your time back. I'm going to go take care of this.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:12.610
There was no, uh, well you're just from the quality or are you sure you know how to do this?

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:17.340
It's like, okay, I'll figure it out. I almost did anyway.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.780
You're special. I don't know. I don't know that I'm special. I think we,

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:26.980
I think it just kind of comes back to when you have a team of generalizing specialists,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.490
specializing generalists, have you, however you want to view it, people with some,

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:36.930
some tree shape, T shape personas wide with some depth. Oh, thanks.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:46.530
Don't worry. He said, what people should be comfortable filling in and picking up pieces

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:52.850
where they need to, people should look for places that can provide value and then do the work.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:59.570
Yeah. Right. No. So one of the speeches that I've been given a lot lately is, is, um,

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:05.410
particularly when we did this reorg, um, because there's a larger number of people who are in,

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:12.220
in this new org that came from, from test. Oh, and this is, this is something that's cool.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:22.590
Should I put some air quotes around that? Yeah. Sarcasm factor 12.7. I'm on a new V team.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.700
Oh, I hate it. Okay. I'm not going to go to the V team thing. Tell me about your new V team.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.980
We talked about the V team. You'll even like the title of the team. I'm on the combined

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:37.900
engineering V team. You know, I hate that. You know, I think that term is just engineering.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:44.850
And you know why I'm on it because I'm just to piss me off. No. So it's basically, if you look

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:50.050
at the attendees of this combined engineering team, it's mostly people who came from dev.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.860
I'm the only one on that list who has ever actually worked in a combined engineering

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:04.060
environment and they out, they outnumber me like eight to one. And I'm like, oh yeah,

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:08.300
this is, so it's going to be this combined engineering topic. It's going to be a V team

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.220
and a bunch of people who believe they know what they're talking about. And I'm going to be

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:18.580
outvoted. I'm like, this will be nothing but glorious, fun, and exciting. You know,

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.100
I got to tell you, if I got an opportunity, it is critical though, if I got an opportunity

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:28.820
to be in your shoes, I would take it 10 out of 10 times. I do that to be like the guy

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:34.420
in the room full of people who are good because it's such an easy battle to win. How so?

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:44.670
To me, the done right and engineering team is very efficient way to work. And I think it's a way to

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.910
get people keep the whole team happy about what they're doing. Because you can do that orchestration

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.510
of leveraging people's passions and make sure people doing what and looking for people who

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:59.340
can find out what needs to get done and provide value. So I think done right, the done, you

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.820
actually even done more than half right, but close to right. Even if you mess up a few things,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:09.260
the value shows itself so quickly that you win people over. I know I would get people,

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.140
even with those those naysayers in the room saying, well, I could just try this. Let's talk

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.460
about this and talk about and I could find stories and anecdotes from the past about some

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.900
back and forth things. I think I could I feel confident that I could influence that group. And

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:29.740
it would be a fun exercise to be in because I'm, I'm so enamored. I'm so something with the,

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:36.620
the data and experiences around, around that move, that I think I could win over that group,

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:41.820
no matter how pissed off and stodgy and they will maybe I can, I can stall it for two months and

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:49.380
invite you as a as a as a my, my outside observer, my normal internal consulting fees.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:58.580
Yeah, the the the there are a few people who I would classify on that list that the

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:07.860
very open minded. There's there's others who I have found kind of fall back to the whole, hey,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:14.020
I've been doing this for 20 years. I know what I'm talking about. Right. My head just went,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.340
is because you've been doing this for 20 years that you don't know what you're talking about.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:26.020
Yeah, but that's not what I'd actually say out loud. I we have a, we have a lot of people that

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.700
have been doing this for 20 years. And guess what? The world has changed in the last 20

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:36.420
years. The world has changed in the last year. I am sure that that it'll it'll just be fine.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:45.840
It's the just to be clear. It's for me, it's it's a it's another cat hurting exercise that I'm not

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:52.000
all excited about. Hey, so speaking of all this engineering teams and moves away from test teams

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.280
and quality teams. Yeah, I've been the chair of this community, this community at Microsoft for

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.120
sort of higher level testers at Microsoft. We call it the quality and test experts community

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.680
as an engineering. I've been doing it for about five years. No, it's quality and test experts

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.760
community. So I've been the chair of that for about five years. And this other group,

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.600
only five years, I think so. It's a group. We've been around for six, maybe six years.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.160
Actually, James Whitaker was the first chair for about six months. Then he went to work for

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.160
some other company that paid him a buttload of money. Yeah. And then I took over when he left.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:36.700
So anyway, we feels like it's been that T in there is going to go away. Just gone. It's just gone. And

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.300
we don't have a good acronym for our community yet, but we've we're going to rebrand the community

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:47.500
and reboot the community this summer to while I'm gone. I've already written up the the mails on

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:54.780
this for to be sent by someone else. But we are going to get rid of QTech and from the ashes

00:31:54.860 --> 00:32:04.910
emerge a community of still senior people, engineering leaders, whether they're managers or

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:12.240
not, who are interested in quality discussions. So we want to make the community more open to people

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:20.060
not mostly not in test, but not from test backgrounds and kind of reframe a little bit

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.940
of what the community is doing and how kind of things we talk about. So imagine you have this

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.740
group talking about combined engineering of eight people, but I'm sure there's some case studies

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.940
that I'm sure there's one of these groups of eight people talking about this in about 25 different

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.990
teams at Microsoft. We can those sorts of things are things we can learn from each other on. And

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:45.870
my my view around community is it isn't just a distribution list. In fact, we don't use ours at

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:54.190
all. The QTech one? No, it's basically hey. My goal with the community is just to provide

00:32:54.190 --> 00:33:00.190
people a method of discovering what they don't know they don't know. So and they do that by one

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:04.670
through the talking heads at our events or the panel discussions or the group discussions we have,

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.470
but mainly through meeting other members and other teams and making those connections and

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:15.310
finding ways to use those connections to help them with their job. We've had tons of success

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:22.380
stories in that area. And so by branding it as sort of a quality community, I hate I almost

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:28.060
hate using the Q word there, but I got to figure out a better name. Yeah, and I'll I'll help you

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:35.580
with that. Although you and I were trying to do that with the other. I know. Yeah. Because so

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:40.830
the thoughts that came into my mind, right? First and foremost, it's easy to change that T

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:46.510
to telemetry. No, that's not. And I know you know this. So I'm thinking you're going a different

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:51.470
direction. Let me can gentecize. I'm worried. I mentioned this before that the former testers

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:58.510
at Microsoft are now over indexing on how to get instrumentation in the code and get telemetry back

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:03.230
and analyze that like that's their new sole purpose and job. And then someone asked me

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:09.230
going back another step will pop balls off the stack. The other day, someone asked me about the

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:14.350
changes and what they meant. And do I you know, I don't know what I do as a as a quality person

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:20.670
anymore. And what I told them was this. I said, look, whatever it was 10, 12 years ago,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:27.550
Microsoft decided they were going to hire SD T's people testers who could code. It wasn't rolled

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:33.550
out. Well, we're hiring Estes and the mental model that went to that is we want to hire people who

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:38.400
can write automation. And we hired a bunch of people who could write a bunch of automation.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.120
Then we ended up with a bunch of tests that didn't do crap and a bunch of tests that failed

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.080
bad to investigate. And we ended up exactly what we looked for. We looked people who could

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.440
write a bunch of automation and that's what we got. But want to reframe that. I want to go back to

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.400
my time machine and say, we want to hire testers who know how to solve problems with code.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.420
That's always been my message. Yes. Well, you and I, yeah, you're especially special. So if you

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.140
go fast forward to now, I'm thinking you can just fix this automation thing just by saying

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:15.860
we want people who can write high ROI automation. Don't get ROI. I can't even measure that.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:21.460
What's the ROI? The ROI. So anyway, sure you can. Anyway, shut up. You can measure everything. Shut up.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:30.290
You have the book. The problem, the problem today is the same. We still need, we still have quality

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.690
folks, testers, people, whatever. We still need people who can solve problems with code. The

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:38.930
problems you're solving, we're saying the problem is different now. The problem is we want to know

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:44.300
how customers use the product. The problem is that we want to know right away if our service

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:49.340
is failing so we can roll back or make a decision. Problems we're solving with code.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:54.850
The last thing I think we need is a software design engineer in telemetry.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:01.020
Or thousands of them. Yes, we need to know how to use that data better. And that's a problem

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:07.170
we need to solve with code. But I worry, you know, the problem, so what are, what we look for

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.890
testers to do, these big systems thinkers, these quality people, people who are quality or test

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.890
specialists on an engineering team. They're big systems thinkers. They know how to look at the

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:19.410
big picture and figure out what the problems are and what needs to be solved. And they know when to

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:27.010
use code, when to use code, whether it's PowerShell or SQL or C sharp or a native service or whatever

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:32.030
to solve that problem. That's what we need. It's what we've always needed. So we always needed

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:37.550
that role to do. But I think as a company, be very careful not to make the same mistake

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:43.710
we made hiring people who would write 100,000 test cases, automated test cases, and have

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:51.310
approached our new emphasis on instrumentation and telemetry with that same over indexed

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:58.130
slightly in the wrong direction approach. As you were talking, because I was been puzzling in my

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:02.690
head, what are the sort of the people that you would want to let's imagine that you came up with

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:08.450
the right name and you send out the announcement, like, who are the people you would want to

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:16.610
attract and inform a new community around. And as I heard you talking, it seemed almost like

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:26.180
how to fail fast with, again, a high ROI. It's about quality. Great, we can measure.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:32.100
It's not going to be a value for us to be measuring quality of things two years ago.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:44.220
Correct. There's also sort of a reframing of what quality is, which in my view is around customer

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:53.360
value. And the other one would be how do we determine faster that the direction we're

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:59.600
going is in the weeds and we need to go in a new direction. In addition to that, there's two other

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:05.280
communities that are kind of aligned to that. There's the data science community of which

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:15.730
I've never really participated in. And then there's the data driven engineering community,

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:25.410
which is supposed to be a lot more applied scientists, at least as I think about it.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:32.290
I am on the leadership team on that one, but I have been a poor member of that leadership team.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:39.250
I've gone, I think, to meetings and to communities. I probably need to open my seat for someone who

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:46.210
will be a bit more active on that. I'm a lot more active on QTech because what my passion is,

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:52.610
right now, is help leading the change around these soon to be orphaned folks and get them into

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:58.370
the right positions. Could this be, we talked a lot last time, sort of the distinction between

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:04.930
data science and data analyst. Could this be sort of an applied data analyst? Could this be

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:12.540
a community where we say, quit doing that, do this? Maybe. What I want to do is, there's been

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.580
a lot of overlap between, and some of it purposeful, but as you're making these shifts,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:22.140
a lot of overlap between the old quality and testing community and the data driven,

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:29.820
engineering community. What I wanted to provide was a way to provide some more separation

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.380
between the purpose and the value of those communities.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:42.050
Maybe this is the T, so you were just talking about a T person?

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:47.570
Yes. These other communities are kind of the vertical line.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:55.940
Yes. The data driven community is, it's interesting. That community, from my view into it,

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:04.720
is very deep. Their events are talking heads for a big chunk of the time. It's very little networking.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:15.840
Yeah. The topics are very data science focused, very stats focused, and I think what's missing is

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.700
the applicability. Maybe what this is, actually, maybe what this is, is on quality,

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:31.620
maybe your community broker. Perhaps. A little bit, I want to wait and see how it's going to grow.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:36.260
We had some discussion about adding extra, do we need more people on the leadership team,

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.140
different people on the leadership team? What we decided was, it's going to be better right now.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:46.340
Let's rebrand the community, have a little soft relaunch, and let's see what happens,

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:52.740
see how it forms. My goal stays the same. I want to provide a method for people of this

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:57.780
community to discover what they don't know they don't know. I want to talk about some combined

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:02.260
engineering or engineering teams is a good thing. This is an improvement, a good topic

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:06.580
for discussion because it's an improvement the way we engineer, the way we make higher quality

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:14.260
software. I can't speak. We'll have topics like that. We do a lot more discussion, roundtables,

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.740
and panels. In fact, the soft launch event is going to be a barbecue this summer where

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.980
people are just going to eat and hang out. How is the Munch and Mingle going?

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.020
Those are for those outside. Those are four or five people show up. Not that exciting.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:36.500
Is it just a chat and talk about stuff? Yeah. Pretty much, I'll call it a soft lean coffee.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:43.710
I don't always show up so I can't impose the lean coffee principles on them, but it usually ends up

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:50.460
working like that. All right. Hey, we're about out of time. This is the last time that Brent and I

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.140
will talk to you. Brent may decide to come steal my equipment on my office and record some on his

00:41:54.140 --> 00:42:00.300
own. I don't think he will. Probably not. Probably not. But we're taking a break,

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:05.260
and we'll be back very early in September with all kinds of fun stories to share.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.140
Yeah. By that time, we'll have forgotten what number we're on.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.700
That will be on number 10. Double digits when you come back.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:20.000
I know. It's that exciting. I guess I've got to say one thing in passing is I've been massively

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.200
busy, but I did take three hours off on Tuesday to watch a very exciting... I lost about 10 years

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:33.360
of my life watching the US-Belgium World Cup match. Sad ending. I'm still not quite over it

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:41.440
yet. I was so happy that the US played in the last game of the round of 16. There were no games

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:47.360
yesterday, and I needed that. I could not watch. I would not have been able to watch soccer yesterday.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.320
I needed a break. So who are you cheering for now?

00:42:52.320 --> 00:43:00.880
Well, my flight goes out in between the last semi-final and the final. So I would

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.080
love to be watching France in the final from France.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.370
Oh, that's pretty cool.

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:10.770
So I'm cheering hard for France. It looked pretty good for a team that barely qualified.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:16.690
So did Mexico for another team that barely qualified. I'm sadly lost to Netherlands.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:17.490
Yeah.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.330
So it's just been a great world cup.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:28.210
So I grew up in Southern California, and currently the teams I was hoping for USA or Mexico.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:36.770
Mexico. Both of those are out. So I'm going with the Vatos. So Costa Rica or Colombia.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:42.370
I always support Colombia's out. But I always support the CONCACAF teams. And the only one

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.650
left now is Costa Rica.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:47.810
And I'm pretty sure I'm currently anti-Netherlands.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:55.950
Oh, yeah. Because Robin... Because I know Robin will never listen to this podcast. But yes,

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.630
that was a penalty in the last play. But do you have to freaking embellish so much,

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.110
you Hollywood actor, DB?

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.350
Oh, yeah. No kidding.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:08.750
Yeah. It makes me not like your whole team because you play like that.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.510
What do you think about that?

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.390
All right. On that note, have a great vacation.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:16.350
Hey, everybody.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:22.430
I will. And happy summer to all of you. I will probably not think of you at all. But

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.750
I shouldn't have told you that. I will. You'll be in my heart and head forever.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:27.870
Will you be blogging?

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:34.430
No. I'm barely going to check email. I'm setting up like really strict rules that I have some

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:39.710
personal emails come to my email that I want to check on. But everything else is going to the

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:43.630
folder that I'll delete. And my UF message is going to say that I'm probably going to delete

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:49.230
