00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.510
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.180
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.100
Welcome everybody to the ABT 343 podcast. I'm joined once again by one of the three listeners,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:37.980
Ariti Pannu. Did I say that well? Yes. As you can tell, I've been practicing. Very active

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.500
member of our community. Someone who is, I would maybe even call a fan of modern testing,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.460
but someone, not just a fan, but someone who's pragmatic and practices some of the principles.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.060
So looking forward to hearing some stories from her today. So welcome, Ariti.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.540
Thank you for the invitation. Thank you for having me.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.940
These are fun. I'm slowly getting better at these. I'm hoping that over time, these end

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.680
up being maybe even more exciting than Brent and I yelling at each other.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.400
Oh, we wouldn't be listening if you were not yelling at each other. If it was a polite formal

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.320
conversation, I think we would just skip it.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.320
Good call. Good call. So as you know, the format for today is I'll ask you three questions

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.480
and you'll give me three answers and then three minutes later we're done. No pressure,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.760
say whatever you want. I might ask some clarifying questions and we'll see what happens.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.320
Are you ready for your questions?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.840
I am ready to rumble.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.760
Okay, let's first we'll turn to politics. No, just kidding. So I already mentioned you

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.160
have some good interest in modern testing and some examples. So what are some ways you

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.280
have seen or experienced modern testing in your work?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.840
I would say that I experienced this the other way around. I started listening to the podcast

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.590
about a year ago or 18 months ago and the principles were already there. So I read

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.510
them. I thought, these things make sense. They seem to be reasonable things. But I really

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.470
didn't know if they apply to me or whatever I did. And then as I kept listening to the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.270
podcast, I realized that I went from a traditional tester into modern tester. That was about

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.770
five years ago.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.840
Can you talk more about that transition because it just hasn't happened overnight?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.560
No, no. And I really, really struggled with that. So a bit of history. I'm working at

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.570
SAP. It's a bit software company here in Germany and worldwide. And I started working, I got

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.820
hired to work as a tester in a very small product that was doing cloud things, which

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.540
were not very common at the time. And I really liked doing the testing. I really

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.460
liked finding bugs. I really liked blocking bugs. I really liked having this deep

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.140
knowledge of the product. But as I kept on working there and my role was evolving and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.060
changing, I realized that I didn't have so much time for testing. I was doing other

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.780
things. And although my manager appreciated that, my colleagues appreciated that, I hated

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.970
that because I wanted to do testing. And it took me a long time to come to terms with

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.060
the fact that it's not only testing. And after listening to the podcast and reading

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.260
the principle, I said, this is what happened to me. Because to come to terms with the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.250
fact that I'm not only testing, but I'm doing all the other things as well, it took

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.850
time. It was not from one day to the other. So what are some of those other things you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.280
ended up doing? I think one of the major things is how to have our deployment

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.620
pipeline running in a meaningful way. I think that was the first thing that got my

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.820
attention. They were running all sorts of checks. There were huge jobs running things.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.060
They would break. Nobody would know what it meant that it broke. My first job was to

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.480
clean this up. The other thing that I was doing had to do with compliance. And back

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.680
then to be compliant as an SAP product, really entitled lots of paperwork,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.520
screenshots, what have you, and to find a way to make that meaningful for our small

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.520
product that also took time. And also the developers had objections to something, some

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.840
quality things imposed, and how to bring them to the company that also took effort.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.300
So the role evolved from testing a feature to looking into the overall quality of

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.100
what we're doing and why. There were many things that we did wrong, but I

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.500
think overall, it was a pretty good experience.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.380
That's cool to hear. And it just brought up so many thoughts in my mind. Recently, I've

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.980
been talking to Brent more and more about how I see DevOps, the DevOps, whether it's a

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.980
role or a concept or a culture. I think that influences accelerating the achievement of

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.940
typical quality a lot. It sounds like you were doing some things that would help

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.620
you to accelerate the team. And then also that testing is, and I also have a long

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.300
career doing testing, and it is one way to reduce risk and help the team move

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.060
faster. But it's not the only way.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.650
No, but as I said, that took me a lot of time to realize that I was resistant to the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.020
idea of now I have to do all these other things that annoy me. I didn't want to

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.360
handle, you know, compliance things. But some of them were useful, not all of

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.460
them, maybe not to the degree that we want them to be. But there were some useful

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.340
ideas there. And we had to take the best of what we had and do the best for the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.780
quality of our product and then just complain about it or ignore it. These were

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.860
hard realizations. But this is also what the team and the product needed.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.140
And I'm just kind of curious, how did you get over that hump? What was the like,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.780
you didn't like it? And do you like it now? Or you still prefer to do

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.500
mostly testing?

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:19.580
And now I understand it. But I think I didn't fully I liked some of the things.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.620
But I think that it helped me that I went on parental leave. And then I

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.120
stepped back. And when I looked at it from afar, I saw the value of it. While

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.920
I was in it, I cannot really say that they appreciated it that much. But when

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.340
I stepped back and I saw what was happening, and then it hit me that it's

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.580
the rest of the things. It's not only testing, it's all of the things

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.930
together that bring value. But while I was in it, I cannot say that I had

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.250
this revelation or but stepping back helped me a lot.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.290
This is actually a really good story to hear because I think when we talk

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.890
about modern testing, a lot of people have already been on the journey or

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.970
they can't imagine the journey or they're in the middle of it. And there

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.010
are a lot of, you know, a lot of our listeners are career testers, and

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.470
there may be quite a few who are in that same boat, they're seeing the

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.190
role change, and they're not sure if they like it or not. And it just

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.670
realizing that's okay. And I think the directions you can go from being a

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.710
someone who's mostly dedicated or entirely dedicated to testing into a

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.750
more broader role. There's quite a few different directions you can go, of

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.630
course, I talked about DevOps. But there's also something we talked about

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.150
quite a bit with, I believe, principle number seven, and maybe five

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.430
to some extent is the role of the quality coach. I know you've done

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.150
some quality coaching at SAP. Yeah, tell me about tell all of us

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.750
about that role and what you liked and didn't like about that and

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.070
how that went, what your activities are, those kinds of things.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.070
Yeah, so coming back from Pteranthaleev, I had this time to reflect

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.190
of what happened in the last five years. So then there was a newly

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.630
built department at the time, called Cloud Quality Coaching. And

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.990
the purpose of the department was to go to development teams, the

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.590
coaches, we go to development teams for one or two months, and

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.230
work with them not only with the quality people, but the whole

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.350
team how to improve their quality. Some teams called us

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.030
that we have a quality problem, and then we would have to go

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.070
in and analyze what the problem was. Sometimes there were people

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.470
that were doing excellent job and they just wanted some, some

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.030
conversation to see if they can do anything better. And my role

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.830
in that was mainly to coach people in a quality role, which

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.870
they had huge experience in releasing products on premise

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.110
or with big cycles. But to come to this fast paced world was

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.940
something new to them. And my role was to calm them down to

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.130
help them a bit, be helpful for their teams.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.970
The quality therapist role.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.530
The quality therapy, it was kind of a therapist mentoring

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.290
sessions, because these were people really experienced with

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.370
testing and setting things up and they were good when it came

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.540
to testing. But it was this transition to the cloud world

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.420
that needed a bit of work, let's say, and most of them

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.980
were really embracing the change. I can't say that I

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.220
found somebody that said, no, this is my turf. Testing is my

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.500
thing. And I don't want anybody near it or quality is

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.140
my thing. I think they were all or most of them were very

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.140
open to the change.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.490
That's good to hear. Because when I think about, I have

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.930
stories about people who had expertise, but they had no,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.770
they wanted to keep that expertise close to themselves

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.290
because it was job security. And I'm glad that isn't the

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.330
case there. So what were some of the, believe it or not,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.570
this is just the second question, I just have sub

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.210
questions because it's tangents are part of A B testing. Do

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.170
you have a couple of examples of things you helped teams

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.060
do? I'm just kind of, I want a little bit more, trying to

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.420
understand a little bit more about what this role was. So

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.060
what would you, what was an example of something you would

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.780
help a team do?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.500
Example that I helped the team to, I said, I was mainly

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.620
working with people in the quality role. So one was to

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.500
set some kind of boundaries. There were many things that

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.860
were requested of them, because in the old world, the

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.250
quality person was responsible for everything. To help them

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.210
distribute some of the work was one thing I worked with

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:38.250
them with. Because until now, it was all their domain, they

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.970
were the quality assurance people. But they needed to

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.370
delegate some things they needed to help others take the

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.730
responsibility for some things.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.250
This is perfect timing to talk to you. I don't know if you

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.450
listened to the last A B testing podcast yet. But I

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:58.330
talked, I talked in there about how I'm discovering that

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.970
one of the things I want to get better at is coaching

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.730
coaches. And really, if you're coaching people who are then

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.770
working on delegating other work, you're, you're coaching

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.930
coaches too, in that role.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.320
Yes, that was the point that we, as we were a central team,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.640
our quality coaching team was a central team. So we would go

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.900
in and leave. But the main idea was when we leave, that

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.460
the team was more enabled to take care of quality on their

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.300
own. And people in the quality role were still needed in

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.980
those teams. But they needed to adapt their role.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.660
I like it. I like it. Did you have I have way back like 15

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.940
years ago, maybe 20 years ago at Microsoft, I'm feeling old.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.860
I was doing a lot of talking around the company and

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.540
organizing meetings of the senior testers. In fact, that's

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.620
where Brent and I first started hanging out. And one

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.220
of the things I toyed with for a while was if the same idea,

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.820
should we have this quality consultant quality coach role?

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.620
And would that be a better way to scale the relatively few

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.540
number of senior testers we had at Microsoft? It never

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.740
happened. But I think maybe the world wasn't ready for it. I

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.160
think in today's world, in a more cloud based org, I can

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.280
see, I can see good reason, see good reasons why this would

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.400
work. And probably some reasons why it wouldn't work.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.320
Some reasons I wouldn't work because you go for for a fixed

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.060
amount of time. So what we struggled a bit about is how do

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.220
we keep up the work? So we would go in, come out. And then

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.970
what happened next? And to keep track of that, we we struggled

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.570
a bit there. And as I said, my, my part was to coach this

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.250
quality transition. But there were other coaches in our team

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.650
that focus, let's say on automation, they help the

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.210
teams decide a bit better on their strategy, what to

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.250
test where, instead of doing Selenium from end to end test,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.050
not only about Selenium, just trying to automate something

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.210
from end to end with all kinds of scenarios, basically

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.130
scripting what they had as manual regression tests. So

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.570
there were colleagues that we were helping cut down the

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.130
tests and do a more meaningful automated test strategy.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.530
I'm imagining me as a as a quality coach there and I go

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.770
in and tell teams to get rid of all their Selenium. Maybe

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:30.970
not. Yeah, that does. Yeah, that would be problematic. But

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.810
there would be maybe some interesting discussion of how

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.090
we define integration tests and who is doing tests. And

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.180
that's a whole new.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.620
Yeah, I tweet

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.380
of worms.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.220
As you know, I know you've listened long enough to know I

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.100
have my beefs with not with Selenium the language but

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.100
with the overuse of Selenium. Lately, I mentioned this in a

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.460
few tweets and I'll probably mention the podcast sometime,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.180
but I'm slowly changing my tune on not writing any, I

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.780
think teams still write too much automation at the UI

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.500
level for web stuff. But I'm thinking with tools like

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.620
Mabel or Autify or Testem, I think the ability to write

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.550
reliable cross browser tests is getting easier. Those

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.190
are tools that use a little bit of ML to try and track

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.110
when things are changing versus having to go

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.830
up the other selectors.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.590
They reply different question than the ones that let's

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.110
say traditionally this end to end test we're replying.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.030
Right, right. And I just I still want as few of those

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.990
as possible. Just like, you know, when the cone

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.110
wrote that pyramid, and we're way off in the tangent,

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.190
he said it and everybody ignores this part and I

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.550
underline it eight times every time I see it, which

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.470
is at the top part of those end to end tests,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.350
write as few of these as possible.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.270
Yeah.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.330
So we've we've hit it. We've hit a sore spot.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.610
When I started this testing job, my first task was to

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.850
automate end to end tests from with QTP.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.020
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.460
Wait, was this in 1997? When did you do this job?

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.580
2010.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.300
QTP is still around?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.400
In 2010 it was.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.400
Oh my gosh.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.700
Oh yes. And it was a FlexUI for the fun of it.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.380
And I am not skilled at coding for my life.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.340
Yeah. So after playing with it for a while, I said,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.060
do you have anything else for me to do? Because

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.240
this is not going to work. And I was lucky because

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.160
the developer in the team wrote a DSL so I could

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.200
test on API level.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.880
Oh my gosh.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.840
Yeah, the sound you're about to hear is the sound

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.400
of me hitting my head on my desk.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.400
Yeah. But as I said, I was lucky. I started

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.760
working in a team with very good developers that

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.720
they realized soon enough that this is not going

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.160
to work because I had no experience in software

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.680
development.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.900
Yeah. And I think I think that's a big part of

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.060
which means you're coaching the developers in a

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.420
way.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.490
The developers not so much. No, I will. I think if

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.410
you have a team where the developers understand

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.410
that testing isn't this black hole, they go throw

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.490
this up over the wall to immediately being begin

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.210
to understand quality a little bit better.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.010
Oh yeah. Okay. When I was working in the

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.330
development team, I went back to being a coach

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.170
in a central team. No, but yeah, as a tester

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.570
quality QA in a development team, you definitely

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.410
have to work very close to the developers and

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.650
operations and sales and business and you need

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.650
to coach them all a bit in certain ways and

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.250
they coach you.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.170
Yes. One of the things I noticed as I begin

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.570
spreading the quality culture, quality culture

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.770
transition guide that that I wrote and

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.170
spreading that around unity was it wasn't just

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.690
enough to talk about it with development teams.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.450
I think a quality culture spans teams that

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.170
aren't developers of software. I think it does.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.090
Quality culture is part of the way sales

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.810
approaches things. It is part of marketing.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:56.970
Good on you.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.570
Documentation. Yes. Especially document.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.650
Translation. You name it. If you don't align

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.170
more or less the teams together, you don't

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.930
get very far because you have them different

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.690
priorities and different goals, different

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.250
timelines.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.330
Yes. Interesting. So you did quality coaching

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:22.570
for a while, but you have a new upcoming role.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.170
Then I went on parental leave.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:27.930
Congratulations again.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.810
And I went back and I said, I revised what I'm

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.250
doing. And I think it was also a lot having

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.570
to do with listening to the podcast. But I

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.330
thought, Hmm, how can I really affect quality?

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.130
And there was a product owner job being

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.370
available in the company. I thought, Hmm, why

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:52.730
don't I try this side now? So starting January,

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:58.300
I'm going to be a product owner in some of

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.580
our internal tools. And interesting. So go on

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.370
a little bit. I have many questions. Yeah,

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.050
the main tool that I will start with what it

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.650
wants to do is we have all these pipelines.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.850
All the company has everybody sets their

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.250
pipeline. So the tools team is trying to

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.810
make some kind of unification of the

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.170
pipelines. You have to be compliant. And

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.690
there are some checks that you need to have

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.050
in place. So instead of everything trying to

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.210
figure out what checks I do, I need to do

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.290
what are the thresholds on all of this. We

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.490
try to make this standard. So when you start

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.850
a new product or any project, so you get

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.400
the pipeline for free and what the product

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.920
that we're working on will do is store the

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.680
data that comes out of these pipelines. One

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.480
for compliance. This is the original, the

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.680
first goal. And the second one is then to

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.160
come up with some questions of what does

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.300
this data tell us? So this will start in

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:56.780
January.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.330
My first question is, and this is just,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.000
there's a name for this bias. It's a

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.720
it's a recency bias, where because I'm

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.120
thinking about something thinking we think

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.600
about is there a pattern here when there may

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.080
not be, but an internal tool sounds a

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.620
little bit, do you think of some overlap

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.090
there with an infrastructure team or a

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.420
DevOps team? Or am I making that up?

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.190
I don't know. I don't understand the

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.590
question.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.470
That's probably because I asked it very

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.750
poorly. So I recently took over a team

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.670
we call our DevOps team, which builds all

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.870
of our internal tools, including compliance

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.430
tools, things we use in our organization

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.270
to help us ship software safely. And

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.310
with all the appropriate security tools

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.110
and compliance tools running in those

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.910
development pipelines could be a different

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.390
pipeline, different definition of

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.030
pipeline you're talking about. Is there

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.990
some similarity there? Or am I reading

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.630
too much into that?

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.630
I think so. We have a central tool

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.510
where if you if you go through all that

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.790
this is where you display what you

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.180
have done. This is one of the internal

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.100
tools. Yes. And the idea is to bring

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.580
whatever comes out of this pipelines

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.820
directly to that tool, instead of

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.260
somebody going and uploading log files

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.900
or what have you, that comes out of the

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.420
pipeline, the idea is to automate the

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.220
whole process. So I guess there is some

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.660
kind of overlap is taking care of your

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.220
household tools. You need developers to

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.220
come up with them, develop them.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.040
As someone with a lot of quality and

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.520
testing experience, what are some things

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.240
that you think some unique ideas you'll

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.880
bring as a product owner to something

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.360
like this?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.120
That's a very good question. That's

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.920
also what I said in my job interview

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.000
said, what will you do as product

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.200
owner? I don't know. I've never been a

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.410
product owner. I think it was

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.890
appreciated, honestly. I think the

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:01.510
quality perspective is, I think it

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.110
comes to the principles again, that

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.590
the customer is the only one who

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.100
knows what is good. And now as a

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.660
product owner, I have the chance to go

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.820
and speak to these customers and

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.020
bring their perspective as much as I

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:13.700
can to the team.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.900
I would say that you will ask, and

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.100
not just when you meet with them,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.340
that any product owner is going to

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.340
do that. One of the things I see

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.500
from testers is they ask better

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.380
questions.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.010
Yes. You ask, first of all, why we

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.770
should do it?

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.250
Yes, yes, yes.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.530
Why? Now all these why's that it

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.050
has a test or why should we do it?

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.370
Does it make sense to do this?

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.770
What problem does it solve? Or what

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.370
what problem do we need to solve?

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.340
Exactly. And then you also have

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.620
the input directly from your

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.580
customers. And then you can bring

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.900
that to your team. You can bring

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.020
them, I think you can bring them

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.220
better data, because you try to

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.340
work more on the questions that

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.340
you ask the customers. You try to

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.940
go a bit deeper than the surface.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.300
Oh, I want this. And I find this

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.700
interesting. I don't know if it

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.900
would work out, but I really

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.500
find the topic interesting.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.980
And it's a development team

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.660
without a quality person inside.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.920
Yeah, you'll help. I think what

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.440
you'll end up doing is you'll be

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.640
the product owner and the

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.320
quality coach.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.280
I don't think so. I think they

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.760
have already the quality culture

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.200
in the team. I think the

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.480
Scrammaster is doing lots of

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.880
quality work. Okay. They're an

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.640
established team.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.720
One of the things I tell my

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.360
boss, he asked, how is our team

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.880
doing a quality and testing? And

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.320
the thing I always say is they

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.960
do, they're great. They do all

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.200
of the testing they know how to

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.660
do. And then my role is to is

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.380
to broaden that amount of

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.260
knowledge they have about

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.100
testing. So they do more.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.100
They're happy to do testing, but

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.780
some teams don't know very much

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.460
beyond unit or functional level

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.900
testing. So what I try and do

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.460
and people on my team, the

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.540
coaches on my team, try and

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.620
help them figure out what some

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.700
other things. How else would you

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.500
test your APIs, for example,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.740
and come up with some ideas for

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.020
increasing the breadth of their

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.740
testing coverage?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.160
Yeah, I think it's something

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.000
that you said either in the

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.560
Slack channel or in one of the

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.200
podcasts is what is the worst

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.360
thing? It really think it's

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.520
what is the worst thing that

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.720
can happen and what is the best

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.120
thing that can happen. I

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.960
really like that. And to

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.200
bring that to the team, I

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.320
think it's something you can

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.240
do either from a quality

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.360
perspective or a product

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.510
perspective. So I'm looking

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.190
forward to it.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.630
I am I'm confident you'll have

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.390
fun and you'll do very well.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.870
Particularly excited because I

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.870
have I have a particular fondness

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.670
for a lot of people like to

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.750
work on those customer facing

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.910
features. And I've written some

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:39.910
of those for customers. I've

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.510
written a lot of shipping code.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.590
I enjoy for some reason writing

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.150
and working on internal tools a

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.550
lot more. And and one of my

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.110
favorite questions to always

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.070
ask someone would come and

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.790
ask me for some very specific

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.210
thing. And time and time again,

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.290
I would ask them, great, what

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.850
would you do when you had

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.000
that, which was my way of

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.120
asking them what the problem

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.120
they're trying to solve is.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.200
And often there was already

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.600
a way to solve it. And I

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.400
think that comes from my

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.670
testing background, being able

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.470
to ask those questions. So I'm

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.630
excited for you. I want to live

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:14.750
a little vicariously through

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.590
you. I think it should be very

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.430
interesting. I think you're

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.270
going to have a good time and

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.950
do very well.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.440
Let's see. I'm really excited

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.360
now. I wish I could start

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.720
right now.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.240
I think you'll enjoy some time

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.760
off first.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.900
I will. I'm going on holidays

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.260
tomorrow.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.220
Yes. Yes. I know you told me

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:31.980
so. And where are you heading

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.420
on holiday?

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.780
Greece going to visit my

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.350
family. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.310
Thank you.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.790
It has been a pleasure talking

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.190
with you and hearing a little

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.190
bit more about what you do and

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.150
a little bit more about modern

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.910
testing. Is there anything else

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.110
before I forget like Twitter

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.310
handles or blogs or anything

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.670
else our listeners should know

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:55.030
about you?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.750
Um, yes, I do have a blog,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.150
which is called unremarkable

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.950
tester dot com. And then my

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.390
Twitter handle is unremarkable

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.190
QA. And I guess I will change

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.630
my LinkedIn now profile to

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.670
unremarkable. P.O.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.980
I really need to somehow

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.700
consolidate all of this, but

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.340
anything with unremarkable tester

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.460
QA, you will find me.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.170
Perfect. Wonderful. Well,

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.170
thank you again for spending

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.050
some time with me today.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.850
Really enlightening. Really

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.290
great talking with you. And

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.690
thanks again for all of your

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.250
support of the podcast and the

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.890
Slack channel. Safe travels

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.010
and best of luck in your new

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:33.290
role.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.250
Thank you very much. It's been

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.410
a pleasure. All right. We'll

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.220
see you later. Bye bye.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:39.900
Took about a year to the

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.980
Japanese and I could I can

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.860
get around the basics and the

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.300
same I spent a bunch of time

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.380
in France and I can get

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.700
around in France. I tried to

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.300
learn German and I just

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.700
couldn't get it. I couldn't

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.620
do it. I had a really hard

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.020
time with it. It's the

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.420
syntax. It's the way they

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.980
structure the language is

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.340
and also the pop music is

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.060
not so good.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.380
Because I learned English

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.620
through songs, recording,

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.420
you know, with a cassette

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.540
next to the TV and Spanish

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.380
the same way. And then I

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.180
said, okay, where's the

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.580
German pop music? And then

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.780
you go like, no, no, no,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.060
no, no, this will not work.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.380
So I've been here for 10

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.620
years and and because I'm at

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.740
SAP where everybody speaks

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.180
English, I'm comfortable

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:28.900
not learning more German.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.660
And now I have to do it in

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.940
German. It's really so a

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.660
new job in a new

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.060
language. Yeah, it's

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.820
interesting. I go to our

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.900
Montreal office a lot and

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.700
everyone there speaks

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.340
English. But if you work

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.220
there full time, they

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:40.820
expect you to learn

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.640
French. Yeah. They're not

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.800
expecting it here. They're

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.680
they're quite nice. Well,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.760
they say, come on, you've

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.680
been here for 10 years.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.920
Everybody in the team is

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.930
German. You have to be

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.050
able to participate at least

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:53.930
in the meetings in German,

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:55.810
which I can do. But when

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.890
it comes to details. Yes.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.810
And even when I was at my

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.570
very best in French, it's

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.890
very much faded for me. I

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.290
I could understand a lot of

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.730
conversations, but if there

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.090
were too many details or

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.290
if they're telling a joke

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.410
that had, you know, just a

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:15.930
lot of idiomatic

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.730
expressions, I had no

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.530
idea what was going on.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.570
And also context. If it's

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:20.650
about some commercial in

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.290
the 80s, it's like, okay,

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.130
I don't get the reference.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.650
Yes. Yes. Yeah. So yeah.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.970
Now it's in German. I'm

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:28.810
gonna let you get going.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.490
It's okay. It's lady.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.210
Have a have a great

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.610
holiday.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.770
Thank you. I hope I survive.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.130
I'm sick. The kids are sick.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.690
We're traveling tomorrow.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.290
That's the three of us.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.290
They all they all get.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.690
Yeah. Yeah. Good luck.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.010
Yeah. Thank you.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.130
I'll have my mom pick us up

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.450
from the airport and then

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.250
I have to do nothing.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.570
My mom will do everything.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.570
I'm a grown up.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.290
You only have to survive

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.410
that long. Yeah.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.010
All right.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.290
It's it's only a two hour

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:52.890
flight. Okay.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.050
Okay. Thank you very much

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.370
again. And thank you.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.290
We'll cross paths again

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:56.490
soon.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.090
I hope so. All right.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.530
Bye bye.
