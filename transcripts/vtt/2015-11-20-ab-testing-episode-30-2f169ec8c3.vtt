WEBVTT

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.360
Ladies and gentlemen from the Palatial Studio D at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, I'm Alan.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.360
I'm Brent.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.360
And we're here for episode 30 of A.B. testing.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.360
The big 3.0.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.360
You know what? Big 3.0. I'm going to be the big 5.0 like in two weeks.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.740
Really?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.740
Yeah. I'm ready for a midlife crisis.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.970
I did that 10 years ago.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.970
Grew my hair out long.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.970
You were 50 10 years ago? That's about right.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.970
No.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.970
Here you're predicting midlife is 50 for you?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.970
Oh no. I'm over the hill.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.100
So, f***. Oh, I can't.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.100
Edit coming.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
So this episode, we have our little list up.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.540
And it's all about this episode is called Stuff Alan and Brent Did.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.540
Yeah. It's all about ketchup too.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.820
Like the number one item on the list.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820
God, what was that? The end of September?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
We haven't recorded. We did the live episode.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.820
We'll just talk about it in a little bit.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.820
But we haven't recorded a studio session.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.820
In a while.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.820
It's been a while.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.950
Life happens and we apologize.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.950
But you know what?

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.950
I talked to somebody. I'm going to jump ahead here.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.950
I talked to someone in Europe.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.950
There are a lot of one of the three in Europe.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.950
Just saying.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950
I met like seven of them.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.010
Yeah. Similar experience.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.070
We have a lot of folks now.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.070
Yeah.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.070
It's fantastic.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.070
No. There really are only three.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.070
They just trade off.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.070
But it's funny.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.070
Someone told me that they like our podcast,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
but they can't listen to it while they do anything else.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.070
I thought they're going to say because you guys are so idiotic

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.070
and stupid and unpredictable.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.070
But it turns out it's just because we talked fast

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.070
and English is their second language set to stop and actually listen.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.070
Oh. That's my anecdote there.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.070
So back in.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.070
I was going to assume it was ADHD.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.070
So they have to take.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.070
Oh, we should do.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.070
That's the subtitle ADHD testing the print and Helen show.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.070
Hey, you went to in the end of September conference called Strata.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.070
I did.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.070
It was.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.070
And on to the next subject.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.070
Sorry.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.070
Tell us a little bit about Strata.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.300
The two coolest things was went to Strata.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.360
First and foremost, it was my first trip to New York.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.360
Second Strata was extremely interesting from the perspective of seeing

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.360
how the rest of the world is viewing the data science problem versus say

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360
Microsoft.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.460
And then lastly, had dinner and drinks with one of the three.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.460
Which three?

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.460
Percy.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.460
Percy three.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.460
Actually, it's one of my favorite one of the threes because he's the one

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.460
that kick started the one of the three hashtag.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.520
Did he I thought I did he did it.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520
He did it.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520
He's awesome.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520
He is winner.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.020
I don't know what's interesting there.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.020
I don't know.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.020
So you thought the rest of the industry is doing.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.020
What is the rest of the industry doing?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.020
Is it is it are they just doing math on Abacus or they actually doing cool

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.020
stuff?

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.020
I'll tell you what I walked away with first and foremost.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.660
Microsoft today in a lot of our internal problems were still under

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.660
transition right to this as we gear up and train more people on the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.660
data science world seems the type of problems that we're trying to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660
solve today.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.660
The rest of the world solved two to three years ago.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.660
You know, that's you know, it's a parallel there.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.660
There was a time in software testing back when it was much more

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.660
relevant when the problems that the industry was trying to solve

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.660
were problems that Microsoft solved a few years ago.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.660
But so that parallel happens and it's good for us to notice us

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.660
as an industry and us as Microsoft to see when to one

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.660
one cool thing is you see happening a little more now than

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.660
happened you know 10 years ago is people actually look outside

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.660
the walls of the board and see what's going on in the world.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.660
They notice these things.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.660
If I understood what you said previously that there was a

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.660
period in time which there was a period of time when on the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.660
test front Microsoft was ahead of the rest of the world.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.660
I believe so. Yes.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.660
I you kind of saw I kind of saw them follow.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.660
I agree with that for better or for worse.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.860
I also think like a lot of other companies have followed

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.860
Microsoft's review model.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.860
Amazon still uses our review model that you and I suffered

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860
under 20 years ago.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.110
But I actually wonder if there's a correlation there.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.110
Right.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.110
Because we were busily heavily investing and leading the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.110
world in terms of how test is done and the rest of the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.110
world moved into the frame of hey we don't need test and

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.110
they invested sooner and earlier than we do into the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.110
data science world.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.110
I think we were slower to something just even the science

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.110
part.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.110
In many cases we were slower to realize the power of

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.110
measuring customer data and telemetry in general and all

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.110
that.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.240
Yeah.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.240
We kept investing using monitoring as testing versus

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.240
trying to test everything into it from before it went

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240
live.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.660
Yes.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.660
I get it.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.660
Yeah.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.660
So cool.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.660
You met Percy.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.660
You learned about some big data.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.140
Biggest takeaway.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.100
Big data as it gets bigger and bigger.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.770
You need to work towards massively parallelizing how

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.770
you grok the data.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.770
And the biggest takeaway the biggest aha for me is that

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.380
in that world polynomial time is absolutely too slow.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.380
N squared is way too slow and it's even getting to the

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.600
point where O of N is too slow.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.080
So we need faster more effective ways to parse

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080
massive amounts of data.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.080
Yeah.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080
It's very fascinating.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.080
This is where we've talked about it before.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.080
When things what you know can't scale to your

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.080
needs this is where new ideas start to form.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.080
So it's going to be really exciting to watch what

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.080
comes out of this space over the next couple of

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080
years.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080
Yeah.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080
It is interesting.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.080
I was worried at the beginning because it sounded

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080
like you're going like tautology mode only.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.080
Like you're going to say as big data gets bigger

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.080
it's bigger.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.010
I'm going to try to avoid pure tautology today.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.010
All right.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.010
Or not.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.010
So you got to go to New York.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.010
So did you do anything New Yorky while you were

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.010
there?

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.010
Yeah.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:12.040
Went to this great Brazilian Russian.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.230
How many what?

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.230
A Brazilian.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.230
Oh I thought you said a Brazilian.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.230
No Brazilian.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.230
Brazilian restaurant.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.230
Okay.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.230
Yeah.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.230
You realize Brazil is not in New York.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.230
I know.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.230
Okay.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.230
Just checking.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.230
Yeah.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.230
We went to Sal's pizzeria and we also went to

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.230
one of the hole in the wall pizzeria places.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.230
Sal's was sort of hey it's famous place we got

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.230
to go.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.230
Okay.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.230
Hole in the wall pizzeria.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.230
Way better.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.230
I know.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.230
Way better.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.230
I think the Sal's pizza I could get here.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.230
I was not impressed.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.230
There's nothing like a slice in New York City

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.230
late at night after about 17 beer.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.230
Three two beer.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.230
One beer.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.230
Sufficient beer.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.230
Sufficient beer.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.230
Yeah.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.330
Alright cool.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.240
And then Times Square that was an experience.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.560
So my hotel room was literally right over Times Square.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.580
It was fantastic that the blackout curtains actually did.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.620
I think they have to do that there.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.620
Cool.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.620
Alright.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.900
So then in between there we went and recorded the live show at Red Finn which you heard

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.180
in episode 29.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.180
Hopefully.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.180
At least three of you did.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.140
At least three well the three heard it.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.420
Interesting to marry a live show with the A.B. testing style.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.420
It was fun.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.100
We got a chance to babble on a lot of things people had heard before.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.100
Little interaction.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.460
In most cases we remember to repeat the audience question.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.740
And in some cases you had to infer the question from our answers.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.140
But all in all an interesting take and we should we should do it again sometime.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.740
Well think about the format of that so we get that find the right marriage there.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.900
Yeah I don't think based on the feedback.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.900
See I don't.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900
Here's the deal.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900
Alan doesn't read the feedback.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:02.380
I don't give one flying you know what about feedback.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.940
Brent however is slightly below feedback.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:12.740
Can you explain to me again how just as a complete and total hypothetical aside.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.740
I'm forgetting it.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:20.080
Can you explain how learning organizations work again.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.930
Anyway.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:31.860
Yeah we do need to tweak the format so what you guys what you guys don't know so we had

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.860
the audio.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.100
I wonder if it's worthwhile to release the video.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.820
If if two of you.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.360
Brent there's there's a reason we're on a podcast.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360
That guy good point.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.880
Yeah people don't we're gonna.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.080
They don't need to see that.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.840
We'll go down to two listeners and they're both blind.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.870
If we decide to show our faces.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:59.550
What we did for the presentation is we decided to do it as as we as you saw podcast style

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.590
we told them up front.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:08.710
We had what a hundred plus people in the room and we didn't we didn't bring a slide deck.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.350
Yeah which I think is fine.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.570
I think if there was one thing I would do differently I would take your little sheet

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.240
of notes and crumple it up and throw it away before we started.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.720
Yeah you said that in the podcast and I'm still denying that it was in the way man.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.240
Yeah in the way from my experience is in the way.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.320
No I think so that one the great news is we got the first ever our first ever live album

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.320
for something like that.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.360
I'm gonna need the out of net.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.480
I'm gonna need the outline or else I'm just gonna get in the weeds also I think for this

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:47.330
format reel in the topics like way more high level and then stop earlier for questions.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.090
I think the most where so I don't look at feedback because I look I observe the audience

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:57.170
look for engagement and it was Q&A where you start to get the engagement.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:05.540
Yeah I think better last time so we spent I was roughly when I re listened to it I

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:13.030
was roughly counting how much time we spent talking about our prior experience.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.830
I think when you go into that setting up a expectation of credibility is important but

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.430
I think we spent too much time on that.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:26.290
I agree with you that if we had just gone through very quickly the breadth of topics

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.830
and just a little bit of depth and then open up the questions making it very clear

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:37.600
hey we can go wherever you guys think is most valuable let's start made it much more

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.480
interactive I think that would have been a better presentation.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.520
Have we done a podcast since I did the talk at GoDaddy?

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520
Yes.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.400
Okay because that was they wanted me to give us like a half hour presentation so I prepared

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:58.010
a couple quick slides on testing a single page web application which I happen to be doing

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:03.110
and just I just all it was was sorry if this is a repeat I just made some basically I started

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:08.240
with the bullet points of like five or six or seven of the things that I thought I had

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.520
learned that are most important.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.640
I talked about them a little bit kind of how our team was doing it and then we had

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.720
questions that for a quick little half hour talk that worked well and also it's because

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.780
something like that you could go super deep on and go forever but I find that even

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:30.240
when I do conference talks I value the Q&A more than you can't really do a Q&A on a keynote

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.200
but I if I if I do a track session or even a workshop I really try and make it interactive

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.040
in fact once I gave a many many many years ago I give a keynote at star and Lee asked

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:51.200
me to give a track session and Whitaker our buddy the infamous the world famous James

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.280
Whitaker was there a good friend with James but I don't want to come to my talk but we

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.280
finished by I finished by thing that goes because being goes I can't use the exact words

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:07.100
he used because they're not PG appropriate because something like holy Alan you didn't

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.810
do anything you made your audience give the whole talk for you there's a quote I used

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:18.050
in my the segue into I went to Eurostar a few weeks ago and there's a quote I pull

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.830
a lot into a presentation once a while but usually I'm talking about some you

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.440
know bit of innovation innovation maybe even this stretch something some new idea

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.480
talk about the Heinlein quote which I will badly paraphrase as I usually do

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.760
but you know the future is paved by lazy people trying to find a easier way of

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.240
doing things and that's what I do I don't want to get a whole talk I don't

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.480
want who wants to listen to a talking head for an hour those people that they

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:53.120
paid to come and do exactly that I know I don't and I I'll talk about Eurostar a

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.440
little bit but I as an audit both as an audience member and as a speaker I think

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.720
it's just much more value when you're doing a track session with 30 40 50

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.720
people to make it interactive versus have them listen to you read bullet points oh

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.240
did you which yeah I had a I had a nightmare at star I had this like

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.320
really vivid it was like it wasn't quite all the way a sleep dream but

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.000
it's kind of laying in bed and I visualize like the worst presentation ever

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.720
I wrote it up I wrote it up it's basically every bad thing I've seen like

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.120
people reading bullet points and turning their back to the audience and slides

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:35.280
with nothing but text it's all yeah yeah I'm just like oh hey and they never

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.400
stopped talking they never get to a point you know okay I go damn it damn

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:45.200
it oh it's awful so I like that and there I saw one cool talk it was it

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.200
maybe went a little bit too far I won't throw out any names because I'm being

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.600
critical but maybe went a little bit too far on the audience participation could

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.280
be a little bit more roll up in it but it was a lot of fun I like engagement and

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.800
the audience was engaged so even though I would like to see a little bit more

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.800
wrap up a little bit more facilitation around the audience discussion during

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.280
this talk I think the audience still got a lot out of it so I can't really

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.920
complain from my perspective I would like you know and I'm super

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.640
hypercritical on on talks and there were plenty there were some really good ones

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:24.620
and plenty of like come on stop and am I upon a soapbox again you are when you

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:30.820
go to these often too often it's a consultant trying to drum up business

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:37.300
versus a practitioner trying to share knowledge with the community oh so it's

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.060
strata that one thing that was interesting is that they they

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:46.500
separated those conferences they were different tracks and the consultants all

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.340
in one session only one track Oh Lee Copeland if you're listening all

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.100
consultants get their own unfortunately for star conferences I think that means

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.700
that there's like one small track for non consultants I could be wrong I my

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:07.240
demographics would be wrong so I'll be quiet but so I went to those tracks a

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:14.220
couple of times and those are the ones where I left after 15 minutes it was you

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:22.280
you pick up very quickly I am NOT going to learn anything here except for this

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:28.390
guy's particular tool in what it costs often I think and not to pick on you

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.630
know it's really easy to dump every single consultant into one bucket but

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.340
in my experience I can qualify this I'll weasel word my way out of this in my

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.780
experience the vast majority of consultants speaking about software

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:49.860
testing at least is a lack of practical and recent knowledge or it's it's just I

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.460
just can't find it relevant I think that problem so several of these companies

00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.660
also had their engineers come and do presentations I had a great long chat

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:08.240
with the engineering team from eBay and it ended up those type of things are

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:14.520
really adored it ended up being kind of like a in-person stack exchange

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.120
conversation they asked questions of me I asked questions of them we both learned

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.080
together but the people who are presenting this consultant stuff I

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.680
think they're bringing in their marketing team I'm like you know if you bring in

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.680
do the same presentation but have it presented by one of your low-level

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.700
engineers it'd be a much better presentation for that audience it kind

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:43.180
of comes back to whether you're you know I'm a big fan of storytelling in in

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.240
general and in talks and often if you don't have that practical experience you

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.260
don't have the story that helps drive the point home and if you're telling a

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.970
story it's sometimes irrelevant but I think really those anecdotes about how

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:02.550
concept X was used and what it did and what you learned are super valuable so I

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:09.910
know we're not I'm I'm we are doing a patented a B testing tangent so I want to

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.470
wind back in I think we can close I was gonna fine then I'll do my tangent okay

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:19.950
as usual brain gets to finish one of the things that was also different was

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:25.750
our rhythm I don't think our are you're in my rhythm when we do the podcast it

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.990
wasn't clicking at redfin and I think one of the reasons just looking at you

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.590
right now right we're we're looking at talking in the microphone we're reading

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.630
each other's by language we can kind of tell whereas and you're reading that

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:47.040
stupid piece of paper in front of you I was that thing is my memory now I

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:53.440
think you're right though that if we had if we had just briefly I think next

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:59.680
time right that sheet has to be no more than five items something that I can

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:05.120
memorize and kind of memorize the flow so that I don't go off tap it topic and

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.320
start talking about individual the color of your underoos that was really

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:17.980
embarrassed I cut that out that was edited out it's blue though yeah Superman

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:27.380
the but that's something I think from so I did read the feedback and I do think

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:35.980
that that awkwardness of our rhythm got picked up by the audience so let me talk

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.740
about before we get to I'm gonna talk a little about my experience at Eurostar

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:44.330
but I've been thinking for a while I want I go to all these conferences and

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.360
I watch talks and see different styles of talks and I want I need to run a

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:56.430
conference no let me finish Brent put your sock back in your mouth and let me

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:03.700
finish I'm shutting up because I want like I think hour-long talks are awful

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:09.130
I want 30 minute talks maybe it's 20 minute talk with 10 minutes of questions

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.880
I don't know what how it works I'm working out the details I think I I

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:20.560
just there's very few 50 to 60 minute talks that I've enjoyed if they're

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.080
interactive you can you can go that long or longer but just a talking head for

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:31.060
that long is just 90% of the time in my experience a total waste of time there

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.180
are logistics around that you've done that before and it went well but let me

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.900
go on another thing I'm gonna marry some ideas have been bouncing in my

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:46.900
head right here at 835 in the morning and a be testing I've also thought some

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.180
of my favorite conferences have been peer conferences for there's just a dozen of

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:56.020
us 15 of us in a inner you know hanging out for a couple days or a day talking

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.420
about stuff seeing where the conversation goes imagine a be testing

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.740
with more people and smarter people and Brent now and shut up and listen

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:08.370
there's potential there I went to one for teller ik that Jim Holmes hosted a

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.850
few years ago it was just a great experience I did the Chris McMahon

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:16.770
writing about testing peer conference fun good camaraderie great ideas some good

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:24.950
learning out of that and but organizing hosting travel stuff I could do but I

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.870
don't know so what I've been thinking of doing for a while and I don't have a

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:34.630
timeline for this and maybe we get one or two of the three to join in is a

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:41.740
virtual conference a virtual peer conference we pick some topics get invite

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:48.540
10 15 20 people everybody has a topic they're going to talk about for anywhere

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.580
from 15 to 30 minutes or some time for question and answer and interactive it

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.580
wouldn't be like an eight hour a day thing you do it for like we're gonna do

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.260
it for a couple hours over a couple days I don't know how quite it works

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.320
yet but bounce around in my head I don't have the details figured out but

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.280
I'm throwing it out here to the masses for feedback and thoughts and planting

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.400
the seeds and and maybe what would be awesome if it happened if somebody else

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.080
just took it took it by the the reins and made it happen and etc etc so I went

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:25.120
to Eurostar in a mastic where in the Netherlands okay so if you those you

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.560
that haven't memorized European map there's a little spit of land at the

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.080
bottom of the Netherlands that goes kind of scorched itself in between in

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.360
between Belgium and Germany and there is a town there called Maastricht and

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:48.030
that's where Eurostar was this year and I went there flew into Amsterdam took a

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:56.120
train about two and a half hours get there I walk in I go I get to my room

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.240
put my stuff down hang up some things that are wrinkled I beat it's been

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.060
like you know 20 hours of travel at this point I walk downstairs I'm gonna get like

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:13.390
a something to eat and go to bed and I see great guy I haven't seen since the

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.150
last year I went to three years ago a great guy Alan Richardson he's Alan

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.150
number two I'm Alan number one we were labeled during one of the keynotes

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:30.250
he's a frequent speaker but he's Scottish Scottish he's Scottish so

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.010
he's a fun guy I like talking to him I met a lot of people who were one of the

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:40.410
three saw some good talks I I got it in Tuesday night Wednesday night we had a

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:49.120
dinner in a cave that was cool I sat with a servant caves mushrooms I don't the

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.280
dinner was you don't know you were there it was good not great there was

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:58.330
some some food I don't eat I kind of I mostly drink the wine didn't eat much of

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:04.080
food at a fun table James Lindsay was at our table he won the whatever the

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.680
European tester of the year award is or something that was fun next night

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:14.920
however was a dinner just for the speakers from the I was only there to

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.570
speak on Friday at this deep dive on mobile testing and we ate in there's

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.690
this restaurant that's made in an old church so just beautiful and the food

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:32.010
there was just fantastic oh so good and then I became back and believe it or not

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.290
usually when I got to these dinners I worried that I'm gonna come home like

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:40.370
full and plastered and not sleep and but it was nice to came home fairly sober

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.970
not too full and got a good night of sleep and got up and gave my talk the

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.490
next morning what's the best European country for

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:52.930
aquitarian to Eden I know it's not Germany I can get around anywhere

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:58.060
Germany's at the cheese you can get around anywhere I think so give the talk

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.900
how to go I think it went well what was the theme of your star this year the

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.700
member I just was there for the mobile deep dive so the theme was mobile

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.820
testing so I talked about application compatibility I talked about it from the

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:15.920
angle of the thing I worked on to make Android apps run on Windows and talked

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.360
about how we got data and really turned it into the importance of using data and

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.730
telemetry and that really stuck home and there was actually I was thought I'd

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.370
scare people with that but there's some other talks on that as well Julian

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:34.410
Hardy went deep into data analysis etc mm-hmm so it really kind of helped you

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.610
know it's tough being first it's fun being first it's tough being first but

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.570
what I like to do when I give a talk at a conference is I'll tie in like

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.010
previous talks so I feel like I set up my peers very well to tie in their

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.290
subjects so there was that next morning I took off I like a two and a half hour

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.410
train trip to Amsterdam I got at the airport early than I've ever been to the

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.650
airport like three hours early but there were such long lines I still barely

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:03.160
made my flight it was ridiculous so then I get to our plane ran out of gas

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.880
that ever happened say we're running all on fuel we're gonna need to stop a

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.020
little early and top her off so we stopped in Albany New York and got some

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.380
extra fuel get to Philadelphia in time for me to miss all my connecting flights

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:22.960
home spent the night in Philadelphia flew back the next day and that's pretty

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.160
much it I was home for a week and then I went to this I went down to visit riot

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.280
games who make a League of Legends hey before you start talking about riot

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.920
all right um you have your star questions I do you want to know where

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.710
Netherlands are you geography lesson you just did that this is actually the

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:47.190
first time I think I've heard you say that there was sort of a deep dive on data

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:52.870
analysis which I think is promising that that the rest of the test community

00:26:52.870 --> 00:27:02.020
is beginning to get with the modern times what based on what you observe that

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:09.200
you're a star what sort of things are still active in the test community that

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.600
shouldn't be and where do you see the test community moving I think there's

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.880
still a lot of people living in the test last world where testing is this thing

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.760
that happens after the development team is done with the product that's

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.120
unfortunate that's unfortunate for us it's fortunate for the consultants

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.280
that's where they make a lot of their money so that part is inefficient but

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.950
for many companies they just it's it's good enough there are most

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:44.210
companies doing any sort of web service or a web page anything in the cloud have

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.970
figured out that data that gathering data and analyzing it and you know turning it

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.930
sideways is the right thing to do are you seeing that as well as test first

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.410
starting to be highlighted at these conferences no I'm seeing more and more

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:04.030
sort of Agilish integration of the testers quality person into the

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:08.270
development team but it's and again I don't know what the right direction is

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:15.110
but more most often the tester in these agile teams is just doing all the

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:19.950
testing tasks versus coaching develop and helping developers on how to write

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:24.990
better tests in the first place so these conferences are helping to teach

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.430
and optimize for the world that people shouldn't be in is that what you know

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.950
I'm not saying that at all I'm saying people are sharing their experiences on

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:37.980
what they're doing and this is in a vague summary what they're doing I think

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.180
people are figuring out how to ship software faster and they're trying

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:47.900
different things to see what sticks okay and that's for the practitioners for

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.580
what I see from a lot of consultants is there's a separation between development

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.580
testing if you look at this I forget is this ISO 2 1 1 9 I might get the

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.540
number wrong but this there was a big hull blue last year about this the new

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.980
ISO software testing standard and is that the thing you quizzed me on a few

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.500
that was the IST QB thing okay thinking about this testing standard is

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.180
that it fundamentally from the very beginning assumes that testing is a

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.920
completely different task from software development so there's just it just

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.970
doesn't work in my world and probably for the world of a lot of people it

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.890
just assumes that testing is this thing that's done after development is

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:33.130
complete and that's just not a world that I don't I do know and I've realized

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.530
and acknowledge that there's a chunk of the world that lives there and that's

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:42.440
fine but that's not the way I ever ever want to make software there's a role for

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:49.880
say final validation final quality assurance right there's there's a lot of

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.680
people throughout manufacturing throughout software that have the the QA title

00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:03.660
happened then no in it in it the amount of work there really should be what at

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:09.820
most 1% of total time spent on the product I'm making up numbers of course

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:15.780
but it should be much smaller than it is true that 43.7% of all statistics are

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:23.380
made up I heard it was uh it's rising oh well yeah all right so you traveled

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:29.500
for 40 hours it took me a long time to get home maybe close to 50 hours to do

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:35.380
an hour presentation and then you came back and plus a bunch of free food in

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:41.380
Europe then you came back and went to riot I did I was invited down to visit

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:46.940
riot who and I don't know if you've played League of Legends no I played a

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.020
little bit and I've played it like ten times since I've been there because it's

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:55.500
I'd and I'll tell you why in a minute it is crazy I'm sure at least one of the

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.500
three have played League of Legends I got to go on a tour of their facility I

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.670
don't know how much of this is top secret or anything but I'll take my

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:09.350
chances I had met them a couple people down there a while back and I just

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:13.950
wanted to kind of check the place out because it's it's the most popular game

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.710
in the world I think they have they have world championships where they can

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:24.060
fill a soccer stadium full of people watching people play this video game it

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.620
is just crazy they have their own arena trying to figure out what rock I've lived

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.980
under I've never even heard of this game you're not helping the cause here

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:37.380
man yeah so they have their own arena across the street their place is built

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:43.220
on their new place is they got from Fox Studios so it's on the set of the

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:50.160
old 24 so like Jack Bowers old office is still there cool images is

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.100
it's a it's basically a world of Warcraft competitor then ish but not really I don't

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.500
want to go all the way into explaining and check it out but it's really well

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:08.820
thought out and I think just done really well then there I love their

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:16.780
business model where they don't have ads you can't pay to make your to increase

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.740
your ability of winning like you can't like buy a bunch like you can't money

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.140
won't make you win the game only skill will but you can buy it people they

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:30.580
make them money people buy skins and and things for the overall there's a

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.900
rotating list of champions you can choose from if you want to have one

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:40.390
always available you can buy that one but and they make good money doing that

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:46.150
and they're massively popular it is just crazy how wild the world is for

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:50.430
this thing and I was asking about monitoring and the cool thing was I asked

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.790
him all my typical questions like I was looking for like what's something they

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.550
haven't thought of yet and they're pretty much you know they didn't I

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.910
couldn't really surprise them with anything I'm talking about monitoring a

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:04.350
little bit oh come check this out and I see this like this route looks like

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.350
NASA where their operations team works is like showing like stuff all it's

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.910
really cool I don't want to give I don't want to give away any secrets or

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.990
anything but it was I was impressed with the facility I already violated my

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.390
NDA but I think I'm I think I'm probably in least in the great I'll be

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:24.830
vague but very recently have you have you visited one of our data centers have

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:31.000
you done that trip I've done the Queen Sea data center trip yeah just did

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.920
something similar and yeah I totally understand like the the NASA monitoring

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:42.920
yeah it's really cool right I was impressed just to monitor electricity yeah

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.640
check me out the dinner metal but some cold people there it was it was a fun

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.200
trip was worth it to go meet those folks down there and get an idea what their

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.520
place looked like it's pretty cool we're either to give a talk or a field

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.640
trip man most of sort of a field trip okay just meeting some people to quick

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.640
take a Monday off quick quick trip to LA to and it was cold in LA was a bummer

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:11.820
it was windy cold in LA is what 70 no it was like in maybe maybe less than

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:20.830
60 ah that's a spring here all right we don't have anything from the mailbag do

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:30.420
we we had something from Percy but we didn't write it down right so I want to

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:35.420
ask okay so we'll do an episode of stupid people at Microsoft I got two to

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:41.420
cover one is right you have a big truck right I do a big red truck all right so

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:46.830
we call it Clifford Clifford the big red truck that's fantastic I have a

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:52.630
so I don't understand is people with these here's my my wonderment people with

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.670
these hundred thousand dollar SUVs your truck isn't that much but no these

00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:01.040
massive you know they're like guys before wheel drive which is made for

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:08.080
going off-road yet they slow to like one one hundredth of a mile an hour to

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.730
go over a speed bump that I don't understand okay is it and I have to

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.930
imagine help you with every single one of them has a coffee cup filled to the very

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:26.010
very brim with my truck I do not even pause for speed bumps I fly bumps in my

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:32.310
frickin Prius there there's one you know what I'm talking about right so I'm

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:37.190
gonna stop I'm gonna ease the front tires over okay okay I'm gonna go forward

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:47.470
yeah I just go I don't actually I know I'm the way here on the way here this

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:52.510
morning there was a guy in a truck you know the ramp down to the parking lot

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:58.970
ramp down to the app so there's this four-story ramp to an underground parking

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:03.290
lot near the building that we're in right now and they have speed bumps and

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:09.050
there was this guy who was in a three Ford 350 which is a bigger more heavy

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:16.300
duty truck than mine driving over the speed bumps in the way you described and

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:25.190
I'm just like oh my god move move what are you doing yeah all right hey we talked

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:30.430
a lot on this podcast about systems thinking did we we managed to have a

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:35.630
point this podcast not in this one previous oh right episode yes we don't

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:41.350
have a point this is the stuff Brett Naland did but I was thinking about you

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.630
when you have a challenge when you want to whether it's an organizational change

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:49.950
or a or any sort of change you want to do at work or a project or anything yep I

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:56.440
find it important to at least take a little bit and whether it's a my map or

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.600
some notes or sketch or some conversations I don't believe in analysis

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.600
paralysis like thinking through every possible plan B and plan C before going

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:10.290
but I do believe in thinking at least a little bit in advance about what are the

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.810
implications of this let me kind of walk through this in my head this would be

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:18.850
a long process so recently and so I I live my life so I'm fighting a little

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:23.490
battle right now where someone I work with wanted to make a big change that

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:27.010
let's go ahead and do it let's make this change okay everybody's on board let's

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:32.530
go go I'm thinking there are some big implications here that you haven't

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:36.980
thought of and like huge like the part he wanted to do is all going hello about

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:41.900
by far the easiest part it's like the tip of the iceberg he wants to take

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.440
care of and I'm looking at and every time I think about what's underneath I

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.760
go we got to do this it's probably not that bad oh you have this part oh

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:58.060
shoot and that connects to this and now we have to do this so it's just

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.660
fascinating to me how and again I don't want to get stuck in like thinking

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.820
through every possible thing but and I'm being very abstract about this in case I

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:12.540
know he's not one of the three it's interesting though this isn't like the

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:17.610
first time in my career I've seen someone who should know better push for

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:22.410
change without thinking through the implications of it I think the reality is

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:27.090
is system thinkers are rare I don't think they're that I think I don't really

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.890
don't think they're that rare especially in a tech company I know not

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:36.490
everyone is I think they are I think I think you have people who go all

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.240
right we needed we need a abstract strategy and they gloss over the

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:47.720
details I think there's a lot of people who are very deeply detail focused

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.360
who often just execute and execute and they don't actually even know what gold

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.600
they're trying to achieve and I think the people who can bridge those two are

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.240
extremely rare that's my experience yeah and I guess and I see a lot of the same

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:05.520
parallels I talked a lot about with the right guys about teams moving to unified

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:11.160
engineering and agile and you can't just decide that okay we're gonna be

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.400
agile we're gonna do this and this and this you need to think about through

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.920
why and what does it mean and what does it change and how do we function

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.080
differently and there's just a lot more pieces in there than deciding okay we're

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:28.630
agile now we're doing scrum and we're not writing in word documentation yeah I

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:37.790
mean it that started up what 15 years ago and it's has led to you inventing

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:43.590
fragile right I think that any I think there's Alan's I need to make a list of

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.830
these along with you used to automate 100% of the tests should be automated

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:51.670
little bit of just a teeny bit of a tautology there but there is something

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:59.080
else that I think every team needs after define team but needs a systems thinker

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.600
to be successful you need someone who can someone whose job it is to think about

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.960
how all the pieces fit together what the implications are of any sort of change it

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:14.000
was one of the pieces of feedback that we got from redfin is one of the

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.200
questions that didn't get asked apparently was why is Brent suggesting

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:25.410
that we hire an agile coach and by the way it's exactly for that reason it's you

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:30.250
need to have someone I mean he right and I would I would if you want to bootstrap

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:36.960
just hire one further hypothesize that if you look at any successful team at

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.320
any company in the world they have that person that can that is looking at the

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.120
big picture thinking other pieces fit together and that may be someone on

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:50.200
the team may be an architect maybe the leader but I think success requires that

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.640
someone is at least ongoing success requires that someone is looking at the

00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:04.420
big picture of things it's the the desire to bounce from fire to fire is

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:09.180
seductive right it is hey Alan I don't have time to think through this whole

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.850
thing this is something that I need to do right now and then they don't

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:18.170
realize that that causes a chain of events that the new thing that they're

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:25.770
going to be asking you to do six months from now is not only directly caused by

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:31.010
that thing that they didn't think about but actually reverses that thing I've

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:36.410
seen this happen over and over and over and over let me close with a story yeah a

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:43.360
parable if you will so Alan's parables guys walking out to the river and sees

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:49.190
someone drowning it dies into the river to save them and then there's two more

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:53.390
people drowning in the river so two more people run out and run out to save them

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.990
and it and there's more and more people floating down the river people the

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.030
people are running out to the river to save them bring them to shore and they

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:04.310
see someone walking upstream they said where are you going we need your help

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.970
I'm going upstream to find out who's throwing all these people in the river

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:16.880
I use a similar metaphor I talk about if we're busy putting out if we're

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:22.520
constantly busy putting out forest fires maybe someone should move ahead and

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:28.360
find the three-year-old who's been given the lighter I like my story back

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.860
all right I think we're out of time and we should call it a day what do you

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:42.390
think sounds good I am Alan and I am Brent good thing we know our names all

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:48.190
right thank you for listening to episode 30 of A B testing we'll see you next time
