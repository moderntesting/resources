Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.980
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:24.340
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hi everyone. Howdy. I'm Alan. He's Brit.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:33.380
Yeah. We are back. This is our third or fourth. I can't remember episode during COVID.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.060
Are the days all getting blurry for you? Yeah. Everything. Every day is a Tuesday right now.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.600
Luckily I have some recurring meetings that drive the business that keep me from,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.060
they keep me from forgetting what day it is completely. But yeah, it's a little blurry.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.700
I don't know how many of these we've done, but it's going well. It's going all right.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
I was pretty happy with how the last episode with our guest, David Bishop, went

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.660
episode before that was retrospectives also on COVID. And then I think we had one or two,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.820
maybe just one. I don't know. We've been here a while. I have some skip level employees

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.550
that I just do once a month, one on ones with. This is our fifth. All right.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.710
The data man, data man. I meet with them once every four weeks and we're getting around

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.790
to our second round of meetings the last few weeks under quarantine. It's like, yeah, it's

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.050
been a while. One interesting thing. And then we'll probably have a little bit of COVID

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.050
talk is we did a survey internally and without going into all the details of what our

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.300
return to office plan is, it's slow, which is good and voluntary, which is good.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.100
And people have a choice to come back in some of the early phases. We have three

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.860
phases of coming back to the office, then a phase where everyone's welcome to come

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.180
back and everyone on my team, except for one has said, sorry, none of my team and my

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.110
whole organization has said, we'll come back when it's, you know, code green, when

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.150
there is no more precautions, when everything's good in the world. And with a few of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.720
those people saying, I don't think I'm ever going back to the office. We have some

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.760
people who are really embracing the work from home and liking it a lot.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.420
Oh, yeah. Not me. Not me. Yeah. There are there are those as well. How are you doing

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.160
on the work from home burnout? Explain. Are you getting fried working from? Oh, I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.650
I passed fried like three weeks ago. Same. I have taken a couple half days on

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.130
Fridays. I'm going to do another one today just to recover. I just saw

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.320
something posted from Google. They have given their entire company May 22nd off

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.040
a day, just an extra day off to rest. Yeah. Last. We actually unity has that day as

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.360
a holiday. Anyway, we always get the when there's a U.S. three day weekend, we

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.000
always get a four day weekend. So that's a holiday for us as well. What day is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.190
that? That's next Friday. So not this Monday, but the next Monday is a

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.470
memorial day. Then I guess right. You're going camping. Yeah. Yeah. So last week,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.550
so I'm in a part of Azure known as Azure compute. And is that part of Azure

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.370
Windows? I'm just joking with you because is it Windows part of Azure now? Yeah,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.460
it is. Okay. Anyway, go on. Azure compute. Is that like a W S compute? It's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.300
like a W S compute stuff better. I'm going to let you finish. But just so

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.240
you know, are you a W S has a good computer? Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.230
Um, anyway, so the executives we have two of them. One that runs the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.780
the engineering or the other one that runs the PM or gave us last Thursday

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:25.370
and Friday off. This is actually last Thursday was was when I decided, hey,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.480
I'm going to attack the blackberry bushes in my neighbor's yard. I got his

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.170
permission. So I'm just slaughtering them. Uh, ended up wounded myself in

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.810
the process. Um, I have what's known as trigger finger. Can't really show it

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:52.100
to those on the podcast. Um, and it's supposed to go away. Hasn't yet. Uh,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.900
it's it's annoying to type with anyway. We hold on those last two days off.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.260
It up again. Hold it up again. I want to get a picture. Uh, I gotta do it

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.370
this way. Now stretching all of my fingers out except for the one that

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.930
won't go. And it looks a little weird with looks a little weird with your

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.010
virtual background, but I'll get it in there. I'll ask you in a minute. I'll

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.460
tell you why I took that picture, but go on. I usually assume it's, uh, some

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.310
version of you mocking me. Um, yeah, yeah, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.110
admit that 95% of the time that's that's right on. Um, anyway, so I

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.870
spent last Thursday slaughtering blackberry bushes and then I spent

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.200
Wednesday, uh, panicking around. Oh my God, I need my hands from my

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.720
business. What has happened to my finger. Um, but other than that, uh, the

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.380
only, the only difference was we weren't allowed to work in some regards.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.520
What I would have, what I would have preferred is that they had said, Hey,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.800
everyone, you can work, but we're banning meetings for the day. Now they

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.800
wouldn't have done that because most of my ICs are like, Oh, well, that's

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.280
nothing. I don't have any meetings anyway. Whereas I have back to back eight

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.520
to six half hour. Yeah, that's been a killer. I'm, I'm five to three usually

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.000
or six to three, but yeah, I would love that. That's fact. That's why I'm

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.160
taking a kind of a half day off this afternoon. I don't have any meetings.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.600
I'm taking advantage of that to get some, to just do some housework to get

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.200
away from my computer for a bit. Yeah. And then there's the other aspect

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.000
because of, um, because of how long we've been in here. I, and I don't want

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.620
to go into the full brain study here, but we've now been in this situation.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:05.080
Um, Oh God, I don't know. It's coming up on two months. And after, after 90 days

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:13.420
of a consistent pattern, it becomes part of how you operate it. It's,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.140
for those who care, go look up how your subconscious learns and the hippocampus

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.470
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And one of the things that I've slowly

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:35.270
seen happen with me is, uh, starting to hate my home office because going

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.030
into it represents the oppression of meetings.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.390
That is fricking interesting.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:51.910
Yeah. The, any, yeah, it's anytime I can get out of this thing. And it's

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.510
interesting because I, because I spent a lot of time making this some place

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:03.200
that I enjoy, but it's right at that's, it's slowly dissipating Fridays.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.880
They're good. We do the podcast. That's fun. Uh, I have a couple of, of

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:17.160
meetings with my PM partners and, and those have become sort of, um, a, a

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.160
mutual back each other off of the edge of the cliff. Cause we're going crazy.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:28.840
Cause of this, this meeting games, um, a misery loves companies sort of one-on-one.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:34.110
Anyway, I want to follow up and it's not just mocking you that I love.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.270
It's in finding new ways and new venues to mock you, which really

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.830
delights me and keeps me going strong in this world of code.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.510
Right. I do try to give you something new to work with.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.350
Yeah. Yeah. And the new avenue this week, it says things that could only

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.670
happen in the boredom that comes with, uh, what do I do when I'm trying

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.110
to keep myself away from my computer, but I'm still near my phone with COVID.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.550
I want to keep myself young at heart, despite the fact that I'm

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.470
chronologically older than you, I do try to remain younger.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.750
There's this thing you may have heard of it's called Instagram.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.770
And I started an Instagram account for the AB testing podcast.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.690
And your picture of your finger will be there in about an hour.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.250
Why does it take an hour?

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.330
Because I'm, I'm talking to you. I'm busy for a little while.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:28.370
I haven't posted it yet. I just took the picture by the time you hear this.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.570
You, you will understand what the picture is for. Gotcha.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:38.130
Right. Right. The picture will go out ahead of people hearing this.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.250
It's kind of like time travel, but it's really just because it takes me

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.250
some time to make me sound better.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.730
And you sound worse before I released the podcast to the public.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.170
I understand.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.370
But if I remember, right, if I remember, right, if I remember, remember,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:01.870
I, if I will put our Instagram link in the show notes for the

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.930
podcast release when it goes out on Monday.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.540
So today's the 15th Monday's the, that would make Monday the 18th.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.070
Yes. Math. So on Tuesday, the 19th, moving through my calendar,

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:25.150
I am kicking off the spring 2020 online test conference,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.110
free virtual conference, three days.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:35.230
I'm going to be there talking about, Oh God, here he goes again.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:42.300
Modern testing. So what I'm finding is I do not like giving the same talk twice.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.300
And when I gave a talk at the test bash conference, which was,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.520
I don't know if you got to see any of that, but what a fantastic idea.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.880
They did a 24 hour marathon conference.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.160
Some people tried to stay up for all of it and watched it all live.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.560
They did. I cannot believe how well put together they were.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.820
It was really cool. But Tristan, who's awesome,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:13.580
who introduced me was very keen to keep repeating a brand new talk.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.260
And it was a brand new talk. Some repeated concepts, brand new talk.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.980
I am off on a tangent, but the point is is modern testing is getting less and

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.180
less modern. Yes. When I first talked about it a couple of years ago,

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.740
I was afraid that people were going to throw shit at me.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.700
And it turned out that they didn't. Some people thought I was weird.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.660
Some people said, yeah, we're already doing this. This is really cool.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.340
And it's kind of taken on a little bit of a life of its own, especially over,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.140
I mean, more and more and more and more.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.380
And so I'm not going to explain what it is and why it works,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.100
maybe for three minutes,

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.570
but I just want to tell a lot of stories from what it's meant to

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:58.060
me over the last, oh God, well,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.620
three years at Unity for sure.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.940
Some things I've heard from the three on how they're doing it,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.780
what Lisa Crispin is doing with it right now.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.980
Do you know Lisa and Janet are going to be giving a talk on modern testing?

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.980
No. Awesome. So Lisa, Lisa, ping me about that.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.260
I don't have the details in front of me and maybe it's not announced.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.980
So maybe I shouldn't say that, but I will,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.900
but we'll definitely promote the heck out of that. I'm excited about that.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.740
There's all kinds of cool stuff going on.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.340
And so by the time you hear this on Monday,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:33.060
hopefully you listen to this the day it comes out because then you can set your

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.820
alarm clock to for Tuesday,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.940
which is one day after Monday and Brent will never get a chance to talk.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.780
Cause I am full of saying stupid stuff. Anyway, Tuesday,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.740
online test conference, yada, yada, yada. Uh,

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.580
that's it. So Instagram, that's it for my notes.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.620
So Lisa, Janet, are they doing that? It was part of what you see.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.850
Do you remember the, uh,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:00.050
the post they did on their take on the modern testing principles on their blog?

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.400
They're doing a talk based on that. She didn't say which conference.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.000
They just said they're doing a talk based on that blog post. And they,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.680
she was asking for, uh,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.920
the short version of the principles that they could use those.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.840
Yeah. Which version of the short version?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.560
I think I used your, I think we're aligned on the short ones.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.720
I think we're darn close.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.680
So business first bottlenecks out, always learn and improve lead,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.080
equality culture, customer is King data, trumps, intuition. Everyone can test.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.330
I think my last one is different.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.640
That's all right. Yeah, it's all right.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.040
It's the gist and we're not trying to be prescriptive with these.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.920
We're just like, here's what we see.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.160
And to be fully clear for our own egos,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.880
this stuff that we're calling modern testing that is happening,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.320
it was going to happen anyway.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.500
Brit and I could not,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.300
it would not exist on the planet and the same things would be happening.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.980
We are two people.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.300
We are historians documenting the path of this thing across

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.910
across the industry. So that's it.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.700
Yeah. I, I'm looking at that,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.580
looking at my penultimate or my ultimate, uh,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.510
my last blog post that was almost a year ago.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.470
And that's the one where I talk about the,

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.750
where I do my final post on the, the modern testing principles.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.180
So my last one, the way I pivoted it, you said anyone can test.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.860
Yeah. But I pivoted is embrace the fear.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.060
Oh yeah. Yeah. That's a little, that's true. A little bit more abstract.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.420
Yeah. I see it. Either one.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.910
Did you see, uh, Abby, uh, tagged us this morning in a, in a post.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.980
Did you happen to see this?

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.060
Uh, Abby bangs or was looking at a preview of a book on service,

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.340
service level objectives,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.540
which is I'm looking forward to taking a look at it because it's something that,

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.580
uh, we are prob I'm guessing I will be asked to put together in the near

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.020
feature. So help is always appreciated.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.020
But there's a quote from the book says QA, this is your last stop.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.500
This is the one group that will be most concerned about what these changes

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.860
mean for them. And I don't have the context of that,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.380
but she says that it implies testing hasn't evolved past the defensive stance of

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.300
you can't automate my job away and we'll fight innovation.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.060
Wish I could properly disagree. And which is the stance that we take as well.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.660
It's a, one of the things I acknowledged in my,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.060
I bring up often is that we do live in a bubble as much as we see this

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.220
happening, as much as it's common sense to what we're doing,

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.180
there's a large part of the overall software industry that live in this world

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.540
where test last testing quality in testers is purely

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.820
an information provider.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.740
Testing is something you do if you're not good enough to do the other work in

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.810
some cases exists a lot. And,

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.370
and you and I have both seen numerous examples of people digging in their

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.310
heels and say, no, this is dumb. My job,

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.810
isn't going away. I'll always be necessary.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.090
I saw yet another Twitter feed last week that we explored together.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.850
I think it was last week. Oh look, so-and-so company had a quality problem.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.560
Their testers must be bad. It's like, that is the weirdest,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.560
it's such a ridiculous non sequitur for me to say that.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.800
I'm enjoying your snarky comments every now and again on Twitter.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.560
I've been trying to keep the snark.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.560
One I don't tweet as much anymore because I just don't feel like it.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.600
But when I do, I kind of tweet like three snarks against software for every one

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.380
snark against Trump. That way people, you know, I don't want to be too political,

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.660
but sometimes he's just so stupid. I have to point it out.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.260
We have no choice this year on that one, but no, what the,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.140
the thing I've been finding amusing is your sort of

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.740
backhanded queries around, holy crap,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.700
did I just go into a time machine? Is it suddenly 1992?

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.420
Yeah, I might've said something like that. Right. But that was to be fair,

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.540
to be fair. I had not had my daily cap full of bleach by then.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.700
So I wasn't quite my full self. Yeah. Going back to Abby's comments,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.340
right? I have seen over and over and over again,

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.920
people digging in their heels. However,

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.640
when the bulldozer of modern change

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.220
starts heading in their direction,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:53.280
I have not observed a single person who

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.740
has successfully stopped it. Right.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.100
So the people who are digging in their heels, in my humble opinion,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.100
they're operating from a purely theoretical standpoint at this point in time.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.960
No, no, absolutely not.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.700
They're protecting the craft. Yeah. Hashtag sarcasm.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.820
Hashtag baloney. All right. Uh,

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.780
was there anything else I wanted to talk about? Maybe one other,

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.290
do I want to get in the mail bag?

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.490
Do you want me to talk about one other thing and get your take on it?

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.900
I have a random topic that wasn't on our list. So I can't remember.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.480
I'm pretty sure in our retrospective,

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:48.190
wait, do we do retrospectives before David Bishop or after before my brain is

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.110
completely food bar. And by the way,

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.430
by the way I've got his book.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.010
I haven't gotten to the meaty stuff.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:03.010
I really want to understand how he measures what we call it vorticity,

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.370
agile vorticity. Yeah.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.450
But it is, it is deeply research driven,

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:16.330
which is great. Unlike say Nicole's book,

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.530
which we also know is deeply research driven.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:25.940
His reads a bit like a doctoral thesis,

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:33.220
which is a choice. I'm not placing judgment either way.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.020
Uh, but I haven't,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.360
haven't gotten to the interesting bits yet.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.580
All right. Well, keep us posted as you go along.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.860
I will do. I'm sure that's critical.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:55.470
So once, once I get to the section, if I'm able to, um,

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.790
with, with my background in agile as it stands,

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.830
if I'm able to sort of translate it to our, our listeners, I'll do so.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.570
Excellent. Excellent.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:09.130
I read the coaching habit this weekend. I read, I finished upstream,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.210
which is a book by chip and Dan Heath about very little about software,

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.610
but about putting preventative techniques in early, the,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.850
the general upstream thing. Very good book. I like all their books.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.670
They did made the stick power of moments. So it was called anyway,

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.190
I've read all their books. They're all very good. Lots of research in there,

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.710
but they read pretty easy. Then I read the coaching habit this weekend,

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.830
which I highly recommend for people interested in not just the test,

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.230
coach or the test consultant.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.630
Cause I think more and more as I hear as I study like that book,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.470
uh, there is a difference.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.500
There is asking questions and growing people,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.060
trying to change your behavior and then giving people advice and pointers and

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.340
tools. And those are coaching versus consulting respectively.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.180
So highly recommend that. And then I'm sure in the retrospective episode,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.180
we talked about the concept of psychological safety, right? Didn't me? Yes.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.140
It's like this blameless culture.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.880
And I wanted to share one thing I do in my job, which is, uh,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.920
and I should probably tell a story about this at online test conference is there's

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.200
this little teeny part of my job where a half hour, twice a week,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.040
once for America's once for Europe,

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.440
I run this thing called the product engineering sink.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.440
And all it is is anyone time across our organization,

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.760
we have about 60 to 70 different customer impacting projects in flight.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.760
Things we think are worth tracking at a global level.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:44.210
What I do in this sink is certainly don't go through all 70 lines and talk about

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.450
what's going on here. What's your status?

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.810
That's uh, because that would be super boring and super ineffectual.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.080
What people do throughout the week is they add projects,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.320
they mark projects as either complete, they're done.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.280
New projects go into planning and then there's a status where projects could be

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.120
green, yellow or red. Green means everything's good on track.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.520
We are on track for the target date.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.640
Yellow means we are on track for the target date,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.000
but there is some risk that's worth talking about. We want to share this.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.120
And red means, Hey, some stuff came up. The date's going to need to change.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:23.210
Before I used to use Google sheets and I used to go through all the history.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.030
It would take me another half hour before each meeting to gather all the

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.670
things I want to talk about by looking at change history.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:34.790
We recently changed over to air table, which is, this is going to sound harsh.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.430
It's a relational database, but it's kind of like an online version of access.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:43.830
Okay. For better or for worse. Uh, and it,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.190
but it actually makes it a lot easier for me just to create queries that show

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.900
all the things I want to talk about. But,

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.020
and we have this meeting takes a half hour and we're unable to go through all

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.860
of the delays and we encourage a no blame culture. We really,

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.860
this meeting is more about reemphasizing our culture of psychological

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.140
safety and it's okay to be late. We do.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:10.130
If we talked about our P 50 estimates before we have a rule in our org where only

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.770
engineers can give dates.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.220
And so people have freaked out when I said this at the test bash,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.060
test bash home and only engineers can give dates. And so,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.340
but they're, and we require them to give a P 50 date,

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.100
the date they believe has a 50% probability of being hit.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.180
And we're pretty accurate on that.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.900
Half of our projects finish on time or early half finish late.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.980
The things that finished late probably finished some of the fish little later

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.060
than I want, but that's a different, different challenge.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:45.920
But the interesting thing is we've started to get a lot of people visiting this

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.880
meeting from across the company because they're trying to figure out how they

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.040
want to run engineering in their orgs.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.820
And the challenge I have is this is where I want to throw something out to you

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:08.740
is I think the reason this meeting works the way it does and the reason it's

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.940
effective is cause we already have a culture where it's okay to make mistakes

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.940
and it's okay to be wrong.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.640
I think we don't embrace failure as much as we should,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.100
but people are happy to be transparent.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.540
They know it's okay to be transparent.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.460
They know it's okay to miss something and to report risk.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.620
They're very comfortable doing it. Uh, every week,

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.580
there's probably of those 70 projects,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.690
there's 30 to 40 needs to talk about, you know,

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.410
20 for each for America and Europe.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.510
And what I see is a lot more people marking things yellow because they want to

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.470
talk about the risk and share what's going on, which I think is fantastic.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.950
My worry is, is why I'm not prescriptive about like, oh,

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.510
here's the thing every company should do because while I said,

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.110
and I'm on a long diatribe here, I should have written my notes out while it

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:04.240
does become a place for us to emphasize our culture.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.790
I don't know how you start this meeting if you don't have that culture already.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.750
Have you had any,

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.750
so my question for you finally is what do you think?

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.190
Do you think you can use this meeting to drive culture or do you think you

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.350
need the culture first in order for a meeting like this to work?

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:26.710
You can do it either way. All right. Next question. All right. Yeah.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.230
Would you like to expand before we go on to our, our mailbag?

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.590
Well, I get to pull out the mailbag sound effect this time. The, so hurry.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:39.210
But it depends on your leader, on your, your leadership there, right?

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.730
If you, if you don't have the, this culture already in place,

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.560
then what you end up having is everyone going,

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.710
Oh, Oh, we have to tell the leader that we're green, even though we're not.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.680
And I've seen over and over and over and over and over again,

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:05.670
that when the leaders step up and they over,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.880
they go over the top,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.080
when someone has the cajunas to come in and say,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.640
we are red and instead of pointing the finger and going,

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.210
taking an approach of, well, that's why I hired you. It's your job,

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.490
not mine. Figure out how to get on red.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:38.100
The, they instead go over the top and they show appreciation for being brave

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.140
enough to tell them the truth.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.240
Yeah. And they do so explicitly reinforced the behavior you want to see.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.360
So that's something that I know my boss did before I got there,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.800
but like this week, for example, we had something off the rails.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.880
It was just a mess. And they're explaining, I said,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.640
and the answer was thanks for bringing that up. Sounds like a pretty big deal.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.760
Here's the worst criticism we get in there.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.330
Let's get the team together and do a retro on that one. That's it. That,

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.050
that's the worst punishment you can have for, for being delayed.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.420
Having to add to your schedule,

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.220
something that should already be on your schedule.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.420
Yeah. Okay.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.220
This sarcasm aside. Yeah. It's like, yeah. And it's, there's no argument.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.580
It's like, yeah, let's, because like production incidents, uh,

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.620
errors in planning are things they're prime opportunities to learn.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.890
You know, my big thing is I just had a copy. I moved it so I could have a place

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:43.700
for my coffee, but I've been rereading the fifth discipline by Peter Sengay.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.160
Did you ever read that? Brits turning around, looking at,

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.080
he has a virtual background, so I can't tell what he's looking at.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.280
Now he's disappeared. He's wearing fricking pajama pants, everyone.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.570
Like a true, like a true work from home warrior.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.440
So yeah, I, the exact book I have, yeah, I have,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.440
I don't have the hard to cover. I have the paperback.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.640
Really? I would have thought you would have had the Kindle one.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.520
Yeah. It's one of the books I bought before cause that book is old now.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.560
I bought it before Kindles. Oh really? Yep.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.670
It emphasizes a lot about the fifth discipline or about the learning

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.750
organization and building a learning organization. If I recall correctly,

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:33.470
it's one of the first places I read about the five wise 1990 told you it was

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.920
old. Wow. Still very irrelevant.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.320
I did not realize how old this is. I mean, it's interesting.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.160
I spent a lot of time thinking through right,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.800
how generations progress, right? The, the,

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:58.540
in how knowledge progresses. I find it fascinating.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.360
Right. There's that concept that if you don't learn from history,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.720
you're doomed to repeat it. I'd absolutely think that that's true.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.920
But I do see things like, like the fifth discipline

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:18.190
being somewhat timeless. And I don't know,

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.070
should that be worrisome? Shouldn't, shouldn't learning organization,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.960
got 30 years after this book. I mean,

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.020
interestingly enough, the book is,

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.580
is greater than 50% of both of our ages.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.240
I didn't even, I was still in college when this thing came out.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:45.250
And we,

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:49.130
we are talking about the dominance of learning organizations and the

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:54.730
criticality of it now. And I, I am, yeah,

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.570
I don't know. I mean, why isn't this second nature,

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:02.050
particularly in, in our industry that pogles me. I find that fascinating.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:08.210
Because power trips and command and control still in many places

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:12.370
rule. Yeah. But we've said over and over again, uh,

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:17.990
right. This is knowledge work. Uh, in, in, in our industry,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:24.450
it is knowledge work and, and knowledge work and

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.930
learning, uh, go hand to hand in,

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:33.390
in why it is still so much of a struggle. Uh,

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:38.190
yeah, you may be right. It may also be not invented here syndrome dominant,

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.510
right? The things that we've, we've heard over and over again,

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.310
the deadly combination of command and control and

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.590
experience as a title, I call it. Uh, and that's,

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:56.050
I've been here for 20,000 years. So I know.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.720
Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, I didn't mean, I, it sounds like,

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.720
I feel like I kind of, uh,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.920
blew your mind a little bit by reminding you how old that book was. Yeah.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.760
I mean, there's a couple.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.080
So between that and making funny your finger, I've had a pretty good Friday.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.720
I'm glad to, I'm glad to help. Uh, again,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.360
it's just another Tuesday to me. There is,

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.200
there's a couple of books that I look at and I go,

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.720
this is timeless and will remain timeless forever.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:31.510
That is because the concepts are so abstract.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:31.750
It's,

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.390
it's really difficult to sort of make it part of muscle memory.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.950
And those would be things like, um, Christopher Alexander, uh,

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:44.870
the timeless way of building that bad boy is going to be relevant

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.810
forever. Um, I forget the author, but systematics,

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:54.170
anything heavy to do with systems thinking systems thinking just does not come

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:58.440
naturally being a learning organization. Yeah. I don't know.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.680
Yeah. Yeah. Should we whip through a couple of mailbag questions? And, uh,

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.280
I need the dust off is a lot of dust piled up on the mailbag sound effect.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.240
Okay, go for it. So I'm going to need to polish it a little,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.160
but I'll plug it in later. It sounds like this.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.040
I don't recall it sounding quite like that. Yeah. Yeah. Cause that's because of the

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.240
dust. Gotcha. But our listeners will hear a better version.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.840
All right. So what's the mailbag question? This first one,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.240
first one comes from little Johnny in Madison,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.520
Wisconsin. And he wants to make a request.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.880
This one goes out to his little sister who's no, uh,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.040
this is from already and it says more for Brent, I guess,

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.360
but I'm going to jump in on this one as well. Okay.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.960
How does CD continuous delivery look like in machine learning?

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:58.210
What are the fundamental differences with traditional CD?

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.070
What traditional CD has CD been around long enough to

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:08.310
have 10 years. Okay. So what's traditional CD?

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.120
I think what's the difference if any

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.680
between CD in a machine learning world versus CD and like a

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.680
web service world?

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.070
Um, I would say from my experience,

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:28.390
the most critical difference is CD is required for

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:34.070
ML. So the issue with ML is it's rarely the case.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.760
So here's an ML architecture in a nutshell. Okay.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.720
Usually there is a thing called a model, a model.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.920
You can think of it as a function that takes certain inputs and outputs,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.920
a prediction or a classification or whatever. It's a pure,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.360
in the old world, we would have called it, um,

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.760
belonging to the business logic layer. Okay.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.880
But then you need a host. You need something that say a rest API

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.680
or something that you can receive a call from the outside world,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.560
and then pass it to your model and return it back. Now,

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.240
unless your model is self

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.880
learning, meaning you can deploy it once and, uh,

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.720
you've got the great feedback loop in,

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.480
and it is constantly adjusting here.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.880
You could think of, you could think of say search engines, uh,

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.880
kind of work this way, uh,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.560
where they get instant feedback from the customer, uh,

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:51.120
a click through is considered positive.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.440
There's multiple things that are considered negative. And then that can be,

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.840
that can inform the models, um,

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.610
instant next round of behavior, even for that same query.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.490
I haven't done it in a while, uh, but when I last work in Bing,

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:12.490
you could take a search term and hit refresh sort of

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.970
10 times in a row.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:18.050
And at least three of those times would have been an entirely different

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:22.570
experience. And that's entirely because it's constantly refreshing.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.470
The models that, that, for example,

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.110
I'm owning right now today, uh,

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.110
have to be rebuilt, uh,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.510
frequently because we have new,

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:40.640
we have new data that would affect the

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.040
performance of those models. Um,

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.520
an example of the model that I'm working through right now is,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.010
is, um, taking, uh,

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:58.050
verbatim from customers and trying to guide them to a place where they can,

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:03.880
uh, succeed in finding solutions to problems. Um,

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:09.490
it's not a search engine. It's more directed than that. However,

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:10.810
when, when the,

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:16.040
the say Azure has a major outage or a team releases a new product,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.200
uh,

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.200
there isn't enough of that customer verbatim for the model to,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.960
to confidently direct the customer towards a new solution.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.120
And the solution to that is of course you rebuild the model on a continuous

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.840
basis so that it relearns the current patterns that customers care about.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:46.370
Uh, the, the benefit of this is it automatically relearns the,

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.370
often what I will describe it and think of, um,

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.410
think of any business logic that you may have ever occurred or

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.970
encountered from dev.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.610
That is just the world's most complicated rules engine.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.760
They'll call it that it's really just a, you know,

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.800
50 times nested crappy if statement,

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.360
if that was critical decision making process to your business,

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.640
you would need to do CICD because a lot of that complexity would,

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.240
would time out quickly. It's no different than,

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.600
than with, with ML,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.630
except ML is much more efficient at automatically rewriting that,

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:33.520
that deep nested if statement. Alan,

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.680
time to wake up. I'm done talking. No, no, no, no. Cause I want to, again,

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.400
I love that we have different,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.320
it's not really different opinion and perspective,

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.440
but I can give a different example, more context, different context. I dunno,

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.760
it's like retrospectives we had, we largely agree,

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.040
but there's some different approaches we have. Uh,

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:57.150
this isn't an approach difference, but I can talk about recently,

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.550
this is going to be a larger story around culture as well. Uh,

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:05.310
but recently our machine,

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.910
someone in our machine learning team approached to me,

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.950
I run our DevOps team and they said, actually pause that first thing is,

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.350
the answer is they both should have a,

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.380
the pipeline is going to be different, the CD pipeline,

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.500
but because there's different tools involved in deploying models. Okay.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.580
That's the short answer.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.140
So recently someone from our machine learning team came to me and said, Hey,

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.660
we need to have CD, uh,

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.580
for our ML stuff.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.580
Can you please build that for us and,

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.960
and own that. And just like with, but my,

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.640
my DevOps team, just like a QA team, it's like, we don't,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.100
we don't like owning stuff. There's not enough of us.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.740
We'd be a bottleneck then and Brent, our bottlenecks good or bad.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.410
They're great. Yeah. Liar. Bottlenecks are bad.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:03.290
You really get security for your position. And if you play,

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.490
bottlenecks are bad, play it right.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.130
You can totally triple your promotion velocity.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.810
They're fantastic. Oh, so anyway, what's fun is actually,

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.210
we're actually are working with them and, uh,

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:20.490
on building their own pipeline,

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:24.810
their own deployments, their own stuff in a way that

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.760
with abstraction and documentation and resiliency that they can maintain it

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.520
themselves. Uh, so, which is the right thing to do, of course,

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.480
but just some context around that. It's, they've seen it as essential.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.600
We think it's essential. We're going to invest time in it. Uh,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.200
it's kind of fun to see how we'll use,

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.800
we use Jenkins for our CD, uh,

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.320
but it'll be fun to see how they end up using it for, for their stuff.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.840
I'm pretty excited about that. It's going to be a cool project.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:57.520
And I will let you, if we find out really cool things in the interim,

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.720
I'll let you know, but yeah, not a lot of difference,

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.840
but probably worth bringing up. I think cause well, one,

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.980
they don't have it now. So they survived without it, but it was painful. In fact,

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.020
the fact that they don't have CD right now is a bottleneck for that team.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:14.550
Yeah. It slows them down.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:18.830
Can become very quickly a bottleneck, um,

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:22.750
from right now for me, uh, it slows me down as well.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:28.310
Uh, there's, there's one of my projects where I am,

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:35.570
one of my projects where we have the model going and there's a bit of a,

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:39.650
of a manual deployment. Uh, so we have it all the way,

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.890
automated up to staging and testing,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:47.640
but we need to make sure we don't deploy at craft models. So we don't,

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:53.000
we don't have it automated. The final push. Totally fine. Oh yeah.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:57.350
Um, but the, the space that we're in,

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:02.350
so we do manually push every week, uh, but the space that we're in,

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.740
uh, that model or the,

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:10.010
the customer experience would absolutely benefit, uh,

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:14.530
if we could do just out of deploying new models daily,

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:20.250
we've, we've gotten actually that's the one small bit of code I've been able to

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.980
write over the last month. Uh,

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.980
I took our build process for building these models.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.600
It was something that would take literally a week to do.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.160
That was main reason why we needed to,

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.680
to do that a weekly basis,

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:41.800
but now I've got it down to nine and a half hours and still have evil plans to,

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.320
to, to do it more and more better anyway.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.660
Cool. Let's do the other question. Sure. Uh,

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.740
just cause we have a few minutes here and I want to get to this one's from Patrick

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:58.340
H. Uh, Hey Patrick, thanks for listening to the podcast. The question is,

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:04.230
does the observer effect play any part in instrumentation and telemetry in

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.350
software systems? For example,

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.070
the telemetry services slow down my system.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.390
So I turn them off or try to compensate by adjusting some settings,

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.110
changing those settings may falsely contribute to some metric on the business

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.950
side and affect decision-making. So if I may,

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.400
summarize that already short question, it's,

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.280
what's the impact of telemetry on stuff being measured?

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.000
And you and I both have worked with us a pretty complex systems around this,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.920
but I'm gonna let you start and I'll just add flavor. Um, yeah.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.760
So I think even, even in modern systems,

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.880
it can be problematic. The,

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.120
how ever brute force is so much easier now.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.300
Right. Uh, in, in the cloud, right?

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.300
We can set up a separate networking path,

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.460
uh, just for the, the, the telemetry, uh,

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:05.480
in terms of CPU, um,

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:11.560
if I think it's been a long time since I've observed that the CPU is,

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.640
is, is really being taken up a great deal by the telemetry system.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.440
Um, there are obvious solutions around it. Uh,

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.480
I don't see any of those commonly deployed nowadays in my life.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.170
Like it used to be a way where, right? You could,

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:37.850
you could set up a config file or your instrumentation systems and be able to

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:42.290
turn off or on and, uh, the, the depth level.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.280
So you would have a specific, uh,

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.760
constant strain that was very lightweight.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.840
And then you would have a monitor hooked up to it that would fire and automatically

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:57.620
turn on the, the, the really deep traces. Um,

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:05.270
I don't, I don't see that as a big issue.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.630
Uh, now, nowadays,

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.910
I'm not going to add to that because one, I think you covered it all.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.830
And two, I was only half paying attention because of work going on.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.120
We're such a professional podcast.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:25.120
Uh, and yeah, so poor little, you said Patrick H, right?

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.040
He's probably, uh, yeah.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.880
It probably doesn't feel as important. We do appreciate the question.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.640
And Brent asked, Brent and I have worked with the similar systems, uh,

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.280
and I will recap what he said based on the fact that I think we think the same

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.880
on this is that the overhead of those,

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.080
of that collection done correctly in a way where you just,

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.160
you're just collecting bits and saving them on a non on the non-main thread.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.800
Uh, and then, and then uploading on uploading at opportune times is very,

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.120
very little overhead. And maybe one thing to add, if you didn't say it,

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.560
or to underscore, if you did say it is the one thing we used a lot,

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.000
I remember a lot on when I was working on Xbox one was our ability to turn

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.160
stuff on remotely. So we had a lot of stuff that turned the collection on

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.680
remotely. So all the little ones and zeros, like here's a bit,

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.960
this thing happened. We said a bit somewhere. We may not collect that,

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.920
but again, the, with a modern CPU, well,

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.840
we actually knew exactly which CPU was in there and how much overhead it would

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.200
have. And it was negligible at best.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.560
But if we had something interesting, like, Hey, you know what?

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.440
Only the people on this version that updated directly to this version,

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:45.200
we think are having this problem. Let's go turn on extra metrics for

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.560
that exact demographic. We could do that. And that was fun to do.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.120
And it really helped us. That's what I learned how to debug through telemetry,

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.880
which was kind of fun. So, uh,

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.400
you can actually collect a lot and not upload all of it,

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.680
but be able to turn those things on. And that is,

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.800
I think that's the key to being successful.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.080
I talk with a lot of teams on collecting metrics. They go, well,

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.120
we don't want to log too much. So he's only going to log very,

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.240
very specific things. I say, yeah, I see why you think that way,

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:13.760
but let's talk.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.890
I mean, you do and you probably want to,

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:25.600
you want to log all the things that you, I don't know,

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.950
the nice to have. But like,

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:32.990
if you take what you need to log and separate it into some of the P zero P one

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.790
and P two, right?

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:39.790
You probably want to want to do up to the P ones because that's going to be

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:43.030
the stuff that you, you go, damn,

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.300
we could totally answer the customer's question if we had actually logged this.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.640
Right. Right. The, the P two,

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:57.560
there is an idea of going overboard, right? Uh, in terms of what you log,

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.720
uh, it, I think that's a happy medium, right? Do you like,

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:04.240
remember the old days when we would find a regression,

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.280
find a customer would find some bug and we go write a test to make sure we,

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.360
that bug would never get out there again. But these days, more often,

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.480
it's what monitoring,

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.640
what could we have collected that would help us debug this faster?

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.280
And we'll go add that and add,

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.440
start adding a few dozens or hundreds of those things over time.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.720
And you begin to build up that ability to debug these things remotely.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.600
Yeah. The, in terms of like the,

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.640
the operational cost of a telemetry system,

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.910
I don't think that is anywhere close to,

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.400
uh, the storage costs.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.120
Even with storage dropping, right?

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.840
There's a reason why a big part of the world is in,

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.320
nowadays are, are described, um,

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.800
in big data terms, right? Uh, the, uh,

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.640
it's because we are storing a lot of stuff,

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:08.770
like I, and, uh,

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:12.970
certainly trending stuff. Uh, for example, one of the feeds I own,

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.120
one of the most common complaints I get from my consumers is what do you mean?

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.820
You don't have five years of data. I'm like, yeah,

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:30.140
I only, I only keep a year. Sorry, but it's an ROI thing, right?

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:34.260
It's it for sure. For sure. For sure. If, uh,

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.060
I get an ask for going beyond a year

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.540
once every year, my team,

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.250
if we needed it, we would use it.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:52.760
We would have already implemented it right at the way I operate that particular

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.760
data feed is, Hey, uh,

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.720
this is primarily for my team's purpose. Um,

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.430
but because carrying is sharing, everyone's welcome to use it.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.380
Uh, that gets me in trouble every now and again. Uh,

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.700
I had an issue just a couple of weeks ago where some team had

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.860
super BP visibility.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:23.720
Uh, I found out a month after they began that they had taken a

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.960
dependency on this feed. Uh, and we're,

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.680
we're, we're trying to use it in a way, uh,

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.880
to answer questions in near real time. This feed cannot answer.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.730
And, and then after they had solidified after a month,

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:45.330
they were doing the full court press, you know, uh,

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:48.570
we're going to tell the VP on you type of BS.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.320
And I'm like, knock yourself out.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:57.120
I'm happy to go and explain to the executive how you wasted a

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.760
month of your effort that you could have resolved by just asking me a goddamn

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:07.890
question in the beginning. Yeah. Let's go have that conversation. Anyway.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.640
Anyway, Patrick H, I hope we did a good job answering your question.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.000
Uh, let us know if we didn't, you can ask more questions. Uh,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.680
you can go to the one, one of the three dot slack.com.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.920
There's an invitation link.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.920
If you're not a member of the community on the website.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.740
And I think that better be it for us today. What do you think?

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:34.900
Yes. Brent says two thumbs up. I'm translating for him. Okay.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:39.380
Thank you again. Uh, happy May. I'm Alan. I'm great. Just as always.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:39.940
See you later.
