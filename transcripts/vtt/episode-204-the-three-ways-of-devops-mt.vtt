00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.380
Welcome to AVE testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.340
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.500
We are back. Yeah, how are you man?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.740
Hey, it's summer

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.380
Depending on you know what depending on the table

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.860
depending on

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.630
Guess where you're at. It's either summer now or summer yesterday

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.940
Yeah, it's by the time you hear this it's summer for everyone. It was summer a day or three ago for everyone

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.780
Yeah, I was yeah, so that's our weather forecast. That's the weather forecast section

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.720
So many stories on I have lots of feedback about the podcast. I want to share. Okay

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.960
You ready? I so I don't know where to start

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.360
I was gonna let's do that first and then I'll talk about what I did and then I'll talk about what we're doing

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.320
And then we'll weave in some AI and by that time we'll have done nothing for 45 minutes and we'll end the podcast

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080
It'll be great

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.340
so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.640
Seems like we should have a theme song for feedback like we

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.060
We know it

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.540
You know what we embrace it and here's the deal. I was talking with my ever supportive family this week, okay, and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.140
None of which who have my wife accidentally listened to part of an A B testing pod. Oh

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.760
Let her know that nobody else has heard

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.220
Sorry of an A B testing podcast and we're talking about it with my son at dinner the other night

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.100
And you know, I have friend I have friends that listen and they like it. My wife says like my son asked

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.530
I think my wife said you knew dad has over 200 episodes on his podcast

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.130
Because that's great. What's the podcast about and she looks at me and I look back at her

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.830
I said, it's kind of hard to tell

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.100
It says it right in the intro

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.640
Whatever comes to mind that's what happens if you skip past there

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.620
And whatever comes to mind it is kind of what we do

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.060
but the reason is and she's not listening to this one so and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.180
Anybody that's already given up on us isn't listening also. So just to satisfy my own ego

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.000
the reason

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We discuss stuff like this is because in these discussions as where the nuggets come out

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.120
Brent and I did not start this podcast ten years ago and start

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.320
building modern testing principles and talk about how delivery was changing over time and try and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.320
Find ways again. We don't event we find ways to talk about what's going on in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.270
In those discussions

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.150
We have to have the back and forth and me making fun of Brent and Brent calling me names and show me

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.510
I'm number one and in that we find the nuggets that are worth listening to and finding out that we can build on for the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.950
Next recording so this is all for us

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.010
because we're good at kind of balance and stuff with each other and figuring stuff out and going from there and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.870
Eventually coming up with some ideas that some people

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.860
kind of like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.860
Brent disagrees no

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.390
We go wrong this is the last episode of the A.B. Testing podcast we're breaking up

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.740
B for that

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.140
A will be Sam for ADHD and B will be I guess random brainstorming with whoever Alan finds

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.540
The yeah, no, I agree with everything you said just got on smart then just without the heavy

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.740
tinge of like self-esteem issues like

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.740
No, dude, have you is it your first time meeting me? Oh

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.860
Wait, no, just podcast podcast Alan not have self-esteem issues. I

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.940
Did I let the other Alan leak in I do not

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.140
Apologize in any way shape or form for what we are like that's I mean it is what it is

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.580
No, and it is what it is on purpose and I would fully understand it would be it

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.500
it's gonna be a hard podcast for some people to listen to and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.880
I'm speaking to what's the opposite of the choir cuz I'm speaking to the people who are not

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.620
Listening to this episode because they chose to opt out at some point and that's totally cool opposite of a choir

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.220
Like preaching to the choir or what's the opposite? Well, so if your patients acquire

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
Right, I guess not

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.040
Because it's not preaching to the people in the pew because they're still listening

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.020
it's kind of like when the when the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.120
One kid gets is really rowdy in class and gets sent to the principal's office

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.120
Then the teacher punishes the rest of the class

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.280
Or when somebody's late for work and everybody gets in trouble those sorts of things like it's the wrong. It's the con

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.840
Anyway, I have to do the podcast and doesn't matter

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.880
It's not a captive audience. Okay, you're correct. Yeah, you're correct. The

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.240
Point is that I wonder if my little pop filter worked on that

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.200
I will fall find out in the recording now that I don't really edit anymore

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.560
The point is that we have to

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.640
Discuss and meander because if we don't do that, we'll never find the great ideas now

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.720
We could you and I could just talk not recording for

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.400
Hours upon hours and then eventually like once every four months collect our nuggets into one

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.240
Into one little thing nuggets are diary

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.250
Yeah

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:06.900
So that's that and let's move on to a new topic. I had something else to talk about. Oh, do you ever write?

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.100
Just stupid code because it like yes, of course you do because you're like me and you hate an efficiency

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.780
Can't resolve the idea of stupid code. I know I

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.780
Give you an example. I'll give you an example of the kinds of things I do because they're kind of fun

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.780
well, one thing I do at work is I

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.900
Probably shouldn't be writing code in my position

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.860
But sometimes I like doing some little things like querying github API to find some things out because I know I know

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.580
Python and graph qls that are etc. I

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.500
Don't know if I told the story on the podcast before but

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.860
My son is very anti big company refuses to have a Google ID on his computer

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.060
Does not want the tracking him and yet we need a way for him to

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.120
View and add to our family calendar

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.280
Now I can give him a link that allows him to view what's in it read only

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:13.520
But I don't have a great way for him to add things to our calendar without a Google account. Okay, you follow him

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.040
I am and

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.200
so

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.420
Huh, I got an answer. So Google has this thing there

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.100
It'll probably shut it off at some day because it can only lose money. Are you familiar with?

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.740
Google app script. No

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:36.180
So Google has this app script thing that integrates with their apps and you can just write stuff and have it run basically as a

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.100
Cron job or on a trigger to do stuff and I wrote one that looks for

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.820
Males coming in sent you I could give the address but an angry weasel comm address and when they come in there

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.380
Can they come in as calendar invites or they're rejected when they come in?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.730
They're parsed and added to the shared calendar. Okay, so pretty easy to do works out great

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.450
He can just put as far as calendar he invites this address and it shows up

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:12.330
It's great and it just I just got an error. It just started failing which means that Google changed something in there in their app script

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.130
Api, so I have to go fix that I was just fixing that when you showed up

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.130
So anyway, I write so many little things like this

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.850
Like I kind of enjoy it because I don't get to really write code as part of my job anymore

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.570
And I'm far enough removed. I probably shouldn't but I do like little hacks like this

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.810
So do you have any little fun little hacks like that, Brent? I

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.460
spend a lot of time writing

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.490
Code, but I make sure

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:47.810
Like the difference I guess I make sure the difference between the two of us in this case

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.700
Right, um is I can still make sure that the code that I'm writing

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.740
I'm not critical path

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.230
Right. Yeah, there is a lot of

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:07.700
So like in my particular team, I think I've made some this before and my team's improving

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.860
Rapidly, but I mostly have a team of data scientists

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.000
But we are a full stack data science team meaning

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:27.100
We build our models, but we also build the services and and ship those services that use those models

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.620
right, and so that means

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.650
Unfortunately most data science programs

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.140
Don't train on oop don't train on

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.660
Hell don't even train on C. See anything C sharp C flat C

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.300
anything

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.180
So and in I have

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.580
Spent time in dev so a lot of the times

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.480
Like I'm spending time

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.080
refactoring code

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Which I enjoy because I I

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.160
absolutely love fixing broken things I

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.470
was telling one of my my

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:18.150
ICs today who who got so inspired that he went back to he's got his PhD in

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.580
I

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.660
Forget the official title, but it's essentially in supply chain management

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:31.420
So he's well trained as a data scientist, but that doesn't teach him coding and he's decided

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.420
He's gone back to

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.550
Illinois

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.350
University to get a masters in in

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.070
In computer science and I'm like right on

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.490
Anyway, I was telling him one of the one of my measures of a good versus great dev

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:56.060
Have we ever talked about this? No a good developer writes code a great developer

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:02.810
Deletes it. Oh, maybe you've held that before. Yeah, but that's that's not universally true

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.010
There's some nuance in that answer. Yeah, it's I mean

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.950
No of all developers write code

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.010
Like my to me a great developer does delete code

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:19.570
I completely agree with that one and it is hyperbole but just because you're right good doesn't mean you're a good developer

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.410
Like that's the only part of that little cliche thing. But the whole point the punchline is

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:33.100
Deleting code is a bigger art form in my view than writing it

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:41.200
And I think it's knowing which code to delete. It's understanding. There's a lot that goes into that. Yeah, that's

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.580
There's some missing parts of the story. We all get what you're saying

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.460
There's it's about refactoring the designs of the things are cleaner like number

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:59.540
More often than not the things I'm deleting are duplicated code or oh if they had designed it this way

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:06.220
Then this whole other function wouldn't have been needed right up. But yeah, I'm not doing

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:13.180
So I do a lot of refactoring after the teams got going and I use that as educational moments

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.560
But yeah, yeah, yeah way back when I worked on teams, I did a little bit of

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.260
hands-on stuff

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:26.420
But I always pick what I always described it as do the important because nobody wants to do unimportant work do the important

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.290
but not critical work and

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.890
if it ever becomes critical and I haven't finished it note that in advance and

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.540
Pass it off, right?

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:43.940
Right, which I've had to do a couple times. I can probably do on Xbox once give your heads up to to the victim

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.020
to be

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.460
Yeah, and we had a pretty good collaborative team there. And again, I always create I

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.700
Somehow I create little utopias of folks that work within chaos and we did that there

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.420
so it wasn't really an issue there is one of my old employees by the way, we keep on connecting and

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:08.180
They said we should get together and we go to get together and then kind of the our message dies and he never follows up

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.620
So Dan if you're listening, we're supposed to hang out sometime

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.220
Something else I was gonna tell you Oh

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.140
Have you heard of modern testing?

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.780
modern

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.900
Right you're such a

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.980
So I

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.660
Know one of our listeners

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.820
Asked me to give a talk at a Leon asked me to give a talk to their company just remotely

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.620
We had a the Juneteenth holiday here. So Wednesday morning

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:50.060
I gave a little webinar to a bunch of folks at his company in England. I talked about now it was interesting. I

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:56.260
Don't like I don't give that many talks anymore. And I don't know what to talk about anymore because

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.580
I don't know in a way. I'm tired of modern testing principles, but I'm not tired of them and I want to get to that

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.080
So this podcast is looking for a topic. It's modern testing principles. So it's really nice

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.840
He gave me like it'd be go for our company to hear about these three principles three and

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.760
three three of the seven Oh three three of the seven principles. Yeah, and

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.800
When I kind of put it together, I realized they went together

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:31.270
Kind of well, and it was principal one are which is Brent

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.620
Businesses everything. I mean I'm paraphrasing

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.570
Yeah, yeah, this is everything so our priority is improving the business. Yes

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:47.410
I believe it was then pretty which one is the acceleration principle we accelerate the teams now. I don't even know three

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.350
three and then

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.670
six we use data to

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.710
to help to

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:01.120
We should memorize these we use data, you know data that good

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:12.220
Brand either. Yeah, we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and close the gaps between product hypothesis and business impact

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.780
Yes, you with me now one is already

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:23.230
Continuously accelerate. There is no accelerate. So can you do some for me? I think is what you're talking about because accelerate. Yeah

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.580
Yeah, so what I found when I put these together

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.140
was that

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.820
They're all kind of about you know, we improve focus on improving the business

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:43.060
We work on it and we can't do enough there. So work on accelerating the team so they can move faster and then data for decisions

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.840
It really comes down to those three principles by themselves are a lot about the feedback loops

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:55.860
Yeah, lean thinking and theory of constraints especially are about they build on improving the business and we're trying to

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:02.500
Increase the feedback or increase decrease the length of the feedback loop increase the efficiency of the feedback loop

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.060
And then when you're able to use data to understand

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.260
how

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.740
That gives you the way to quickly like super quickly understand because you deploy a little bit of a bit of a thing and then

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:19.950
You can get feedback right away if that thing's working for a customer. Yeah, it's it's

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:27.770
It's interesting you just bringing it the three and I'm looking at this and I'm like, okay

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.480
And now looking at NTP with a totally different light, right? I'm like, okay

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.450
Like if we just had those three

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.310
Right. Let's say monetize some vegetables were just those three

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:47.190
Now I'll tell you I'll tell you what happens when that happens, but you go ahead and with your thought. Oh, okay

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.680
No, just tell me because

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.680
well, right once

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.720
once the police officer and

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.160
Oh

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.120
Do you hear the sign? Yeah, I'm being arrested

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:06.160
so what I found when I was going I did those three and talked about them and then I realized I was putting together my

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.470
presentation is

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.110
you know, we had

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.550
somebody pointed out many many years ago that

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:19.350
The principals were very close to or had a lot of overlap with the three ways of DevOps from Jean Kim

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.530
Don't know if you remember those at all, but no it those three especially

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:31.170
But I talked about the modern testing principles being not that modern not that much about testing their delivery principles and they're very good delivery

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.970
Principles, but the three ways of DevOps from Jean Kim's I think it was in his first book on DevOps

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.450
Probably I think it predates

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:44.430
Us I think it's 2012 2013 that came out. But the first way is systems thinking

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.200
Which is seeing in his case seeing

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.440
Development and operations as one big thing not as separate things being thrown over the wall

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.140
The whole idea behind DevOps was get rid of the wall between Dev and ops

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.600
It's all about delivering value to the customer. So system thinking see the whole thing right in there

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.160
And this was the key thing because like the the wise guy

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.400
The sorry, I don't want to say that way the guru in Phoenix project kept on talking about oh

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.400
You've just figured out the first way

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.240
Yeah, and because same author same is it's a way of putting that in there right and then

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.400
The the second way is to amplify the feedback loops

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.720
Make sure that they're apparent and obvious and we're trying to learn we deployed ops we learn comes back to dev

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.920
We learn more we give it to ops to learn more and give it back to dev learning and cycling

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.920
And then the third way is a culture of continual experimentation and learning. Mm-hmm

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And I just found it interesting

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:55.720
How well those those lined up with especially principles two and six it's a lot about let's make sure well one

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.320
Systems thinking is we focus on improving the business the business is the system

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.740
Three whichever one or yeah three continuous improvement

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:11.220
That's amplifying the feedback loops and six is a way for us to enable continual experimentation

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:17.060
It is hard to do continual experimentation if you don't have the speed of using data for your feedback loop, right?

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.290
In the know there I might with you like like it even says in in

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:31.490
Principle like close the gaps of being product hypotheses if you mention the word hypotheses like you're

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.610
You're thinking about experimentation

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.410
Yeah, yeah

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:42.450
And so anyway it I it popped into my head when I was working on the presentation

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.930
because I haven't looked at it in a while and I looked at it and was kind of

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.850
Pleasantly surprised maybe blown away is too hard, but very interesting to see how those line up

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.490
So there is a nugget of takeaway

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:02.290
That you all can take who are looking for valuable content in the EAB testing podcast. Yeah, it's interesting before you vote

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.090
Jean Kim I was thinking of our near to right and

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.770
And you could take the same three

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.720
and

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.120
In kind of plug-in right here and said but the thing is actually I guess that shouldn't be a surprise

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.760
right because

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.760
angel and lean

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:32.620
It had a lot of different folks with different voices in a different view points all very much

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.620
In alignment with each other but different language around how they explained

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.800
What it was about right? Um

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.400
right, Brennierdson

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:51.440
Is fantastic like he was very quantified like I nearly got his his chapter around small batching

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.840
Memorized like that was like how he described why you do small batches

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.720
Which in my view is is in alignment with continual learning?

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.880
Yeah, his whole book is around flow and systems thinking like he he would be a massive

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.940
Yeah, it all fits together and what it comes down to

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.880
Dear listener is

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.920
remember Brent and I

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.980
Don't really have many original thoughts

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.980
But we bring in all what we know and kind of regurgitate it in a way

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.980
We think makes sense to our audience

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:34.060
So the number of the other four there's two things I'm thinking about now with MTP, okay, I

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:41.380
Kind of wish we had this insight that you just shared like what is it seven years ago?

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:47.700
Because now I kind of want to find a way to slightly rewrite principle one

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:54.540
Dude, we can rewrite anything we want. No, I know I know that like it's ours

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.340
You wish you would you wish you would have gone back in time kind of like in Deadpool 2 and

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:04.140
When Ryan Reynolds goes backs and fixes the whole Green Lantern crap. Yeah

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:16.970
No, I'll start thinking about this because I like our priorities improving the business like when we originally wrote that at least

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.970
What was in my head was?

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.240
We need to get testers

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.230
Thinking about the system

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.850
not about their small part like

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.770
If you got if anyone listening to this podcast still believes

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:45.480
That it's testers job to provide information. I really have to wonder at this point in time

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.040
Why you still listen number one number two?

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.420
Like you got to realize that that point of view is now

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:04.260
Absolutely. No longer mainstream. Well the things we were trying to remember going back to the context on this

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.340
It's probably good to go over this once in a while is that

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.460
We were trying to help testers at the time navigate into this new world

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.760
And we were clearly saying if you keep doing what you're doing now

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.200
If you were your jobs at risk, it's not

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.720
Unless you keep on doing exactly what you're doing now and hope it to keep working

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.800
Testers have always been good at systems thinking so these were not reaches these weren't like here's your career change

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.480
These are things you're capable of doing now

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.160
If you do them you you are safe your job is secure. You will stay employed

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.760
systems thinking super important and I get and I have been

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:52.680
Messaged in and a little passive aggression from the world that I've talked about it before is I bring a principle one

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.280
That's that's ridiculous. We can't improve the business. All we can do is provide information

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.000
It's like maybe in 1994, but thank you very much

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.400
And you know what if I knew what I knew if if I knew back then what I knew now

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.320
I think I would have fought that too. I think so too, but

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:18.080
There were different constraints right there was a lot more things we had to do proactive the feedback loop was a lot slower

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.050
but

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:28.060
You know, I honestly believe that the role of Q of QA being information providers

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.400
was always wrong it is

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:39.050
Absolutely wrong today. I think you know, I used to talk about this and just felt very

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.710
Passive and the way it always felt to me. I want to get deep in this people people really feel this way

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.110
those people don't listen to the podcast so it's fine, but it's

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:54.670
It's like and then what like that's really all that's I mean, okay

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.430
has always been my feedback on that even going back to

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:05.870
Lessons learned in software testing which honestly has some good nuggets in it. It's a little repetitive

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.110
It's kind of funny in some places purposely I give them full credit for that but

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.820
providing information

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.700
now

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.700
No, no, no

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.100
It's never been correct. It's never been correct like

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:29.940
My very first podcast like not podcast but blog was around now our job is to remove risks from the system

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.020
Right. It's not but we don't own the decisions

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.690
Then what's wrong with you own the decisions

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:43.490
Like we we we've agreed we shouldn't be owning the decision to stop ship or not

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.770
But it is our job to remove to remove risk from the system

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:52.530
Yeah, why can't why can't why are we where people trying to be information providers?

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.490
Why can't you be part of the decision making progress? How come like I would feel so

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:02.610
Unempowered if my job was say Brent. Here's everything I know and I

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:08.130
I'm not I don't I don't have an opinion because it's not my job. Please make my choice for me

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.210
It's probably that and I'm sure you have the term

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:18.290
Memorized but that that bullshit was a cognitive distance or whatever the hell it is. Oh

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.840
Critical this is yes, this is why developers can't test they don't have critical distance. Well, I'm being sarcastic

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:32.640
It's also probably why we're just information providers because no we can't make the decisions around

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.640
What's good for the business? No?

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.600
Anyway before we get to like right now I'm thinking

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:45.390
Principle number one somehow needs to term systems thinking in it. Oh

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:54.020
Yeah, okay, right I like you want to take up like right well, let's do it later like right sure

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:59.380
I'm like it's short and sweet. It's the only one of the damn thing that's sweet. So like

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.100
Adding systems thinking is probably gonna triple the number of words

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.300
But I wish it were there

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.900
Yeah, but when we look at

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.780
When we look at how these work today, so make these are

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.420
apply these to the team like we wrote these as

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.710
the

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.030
Tester trying to figure out what to do is your audience

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.150
Today, they're kind of a message for the team

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.190
This is how you deliver in a way that won't get you all the way back to

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.310
2004

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.270
So it's the team's priorities improving the business

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:40.910
now if you consider yourself to be in this separate little silo of testing and

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:48.050
Even then you should have an opinion but the team like can everyone on the team have good systems thinking

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.220
Yes, I would hope so

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.680
Why don't they?

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.380
I do believe systems thinking is trainable

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.360
But I do also think

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.890
But from my experience

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:17.010
there there's there's kind of the forest people in the tree people like the people who kind of see the forest and people who see the

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.010
trees and

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.090
And I do think we need both

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:28.770
I don't think one's better than the other because I like if I keep this awkward metaphor going the tree people are very good at the details

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:36.850
Whereas the the forest people are good at the abstract and the strategy but suck at the details like for me

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:42.730
Devils in the details is the bane of my existence. Yep. Me too. It drives me crazy

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.410
we're doing but as I were doing budgets right now and

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.050
they're in Excel and

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:56.210
It's an absolute madhouse of chaos and I look at it and I just cry I

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.170
Curl up in a ball and I decide to try it again another day that I understand

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.210
The other thing you might try is

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.350
drugs delegation

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.350
That that also works as well

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:17.440
There's such a you may know so there's I can say this fairly there's a lot of

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.140
hierarchical

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.860
Non-transparency so some of this stuff I cannot delegate because

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:31.980
I'm told not to delegate it because there's fear that someone may see something that I'm supposed to in the budget and

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:38.060
So yes, but normally absolutely delegate. This is right. This is what managers do and

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.180
Once again, the podcast goes all over the place. I'm gonna reel it back in in a second

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:48.300
But we I mean any manager like you delegate the stuff that not just you don't want to do

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.700
But the stuff that'll help somebody grow and that they could actually do better than you

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.700
I have a couple directs who do some things

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.340
Made most of my directs do so many things

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.700
So well that are things I can't do. I'm very very fortunate. I

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:09.320
To me this is the lesson of strength finders that I walked away with right? It's essentially

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:16.780
I'll tell a very quick story. I probably have already told it before one of the strength chapter 27

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.300
One of the one of the strengths is one called communication

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:27.550
Okay, and I was once on the team that we had did every manager had to

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.310
send a

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.710
Weekly status report. Okay, I

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:40.030
Would rather shoot myself on the head then sit down and write status reports, right?

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:45.610
Because the are I am so this is one of the things that lean and agile has done to me

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.430
I am so ROI focused

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:57.800
Unlike no one reads these I'm just invest I'm just investing in it. I'm doing it because I've been told I have to

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:05.480
The only thing that I can tell from the past experience is that the only thing is done with the status reports is that

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:12.550
My management chain knows who's done it or not like there's some tracking system in place. Okay, and so

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.390
One of my IC had communication

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:25.190
And I this was early on in my my journey and strengths and I read it but the book what communications about

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.540
and I

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.700
Connected the dots because that's one of my strengths is connecting dots and I said hey

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.070
according to this

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:41.230
This guy might be good at it. Number one and number two love doing it

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.700
Okay, whereas I have always like the other thing I do

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:51.700
Is I take on the bullshit work that has to be done that no one really wants to do

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.370
So like I okay, I could delegate the status report

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:04.180
But I hate it and I'm not gonna pass on shit work to my people who's trying to do things that they're proud of

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.460
But yeah, I wouldn't talk to him. I'll finish the story. I wouldn't talk

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:14.740
No, good. I have a follow-up story as we continue our trip to tangentown. I

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.420
Wait to him and I said

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:27.820
Hey, his name was Renee Renee. I hate doing this. I do it because I'm told to do it

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.580
Would you like to take it over I didn't delegate it to him I asked him would you like to take it over and

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.740
I even explained to him why

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.700
And he looked at me

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.540
like I

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.880
Just offered him the best

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.960
Sweetest candy that could ever be given to anybody ever

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.720
Okay, and he's like

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.680
He no thought process about it. Yes. I want it

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.860
Okay

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:08.020
He started taking it over and it is the only time in my career

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.760
Where I had external teams that I had never heard of before

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.280
Asked to sign up for my goddamn status report

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:25.610
That is the stupidest damn story in the world no I get it I get it and I don't really like them I think

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.350
But I have an interesting story. I want to share as an alternative

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:35.110
A lot of my team just post some recaps end of week recaps in slack which I can catch up on

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:39.090
I don't require them to I have Jira. I talked to them. I could figure out what's going on

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.070
I can get answers everything. I need to know it's it's it seems more like

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:51.810
Box checking than anything else one thing my last manager did at Unity which was actually fun

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.690
you know, I blog every week and I like to write and

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:03.430
What he asked me to do and I'll I save the doc I'll scroll back I have a hundred page doc here

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.610
I didn't write all at once

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.800
but

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.800
He just asked me to write

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.600
Once a week

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.600
Send me what you're thinking

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.740
and

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:21.500
like organized like I called him my my org name organizational notes and it was

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:28.500
Sometimes about things going on on the team some things about something on our leadership team thoughts. I had about

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.140
strategy or

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:34.380
Whether it's organizational strategy or product strategy

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:41.660
But I just every week I would write a list of top-of-mind topics and he would read it

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:48.700
Every week and sometimes it'd be often but not always we stuff that would be discussing our one-on-ones go a little deeper into

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.020
But it was more about it was less about

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.240
Well, I think the difference is it's fair to say this now that we know that I have a job

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:02.840
that's a little weird, but okay is I was in much more of a leadership position there and a little bit more of a

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.800
management position here if that makes sense and so a lot of our discussions around the

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.760
Moving the company and how can we do this and how should we work here should be what what?

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.160
What organizational changes should we make across the org? What products should be billed?

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:23.640
What things should we go invest in potentially buying or I bounce head like when I had org change ideas

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.480
I could bounce them off of them. We'd have discussions. It was a good way for him to kind of know

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.040
Just it was like we had a 20 minute

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:37.000
Hallway conversation about something that I thought was super interesting during that week

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.320
and that sort of thing I like doing I hate status reports and I

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.000
Don't like them. I don't ask my team for them

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.720
But I do like the idea of I haven't asked my team for these either. I'm kind of more

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.480
Making sure the work gets done. But this idea of organizational notes was

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.500
was pretty

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.340
I

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:08.580
Could just finish what one last thing before I forget is as I mentioned before just kind of capital up here

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:12.220
It's one of the docks I saved when I left

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.680
It's I just added to the same dock every week so I could keep my progression

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.940
so I have little like this hundred pages of of notes that I sent him and

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.060
It's it's I just kind of scrolled through our talking. I forgot about it. And it's

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.700
You know, it's it's interesting. It's how I you know, you know, my leadership style of planting seeds

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.340
It's how I'd plant seeds with them here. Here's the way I'm thinking about reorganizing the team

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:40.580
I won't mention this again for another two months. But now it's not now it's it's in a cell in the back of your brain

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.090
anyway, go

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.810
No, so I like that. I don't know that I could do that with

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.920
my manager because

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.750
It depends on the manager a lot of what they want

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:58.550
They don't want a wall of text like I'll and Steve. Hello Steve. Steve wants to be on the podcast sometime

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.870
I'll let you guys talk but Steve does not want a wall of text

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.550
Steve wants Steve wants little nuggets and that's fine. So you have to do it Luke at unity

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:12.950
He wanted a wall of text. He was a thinker and he was not that Steve you're not a thinker

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.750
People people want their information in different ways. I'm gonna shut up. Go ahead

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:24.690
I'm more of an alignment. I think with Steve on this one with with my reports. I don't want a wall of text

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:31.890
What I want to know is that you've thought about the agenda in that we have something useful

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:37.610
interesting and or important to talk about like for me it's around

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:43.010
Getting my people to be proactive around how they want to use their time with me

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:49.570
I don't want to read at the point of a 101 is to talk through it and have an interaction and

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:56.530
Part of it is for me to be a mentor part of it's me to be a manager part of like status

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:03.650
Like I've I've explicitly told them like I don't want status reports. I don't

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.230
want

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.590
them even in the our 101s

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.730
right because we have a daily stand-up I have a

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:22.170
Separately scheduled office hours with with my team like status that I need to know about I'll know about

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.530
But I like this idea of

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:35.010
What's on your mind now the thing the thing I would like to do

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.560
Because if I were to say it that vaguely

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:46.270
They would probably think of it as again agenda items for our 101

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:52.470
It depends it depends on the manager in the relationship and it's gonna be different because on both people

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.230
It's gonna be different in every single case

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:59.230
I know Luke asked for this of all of his directs and I'm probably the only one that did it regularly

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.230
I know that a lot of people

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.270
Luke would send them to me to show them minds they get some ideas

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:11.070
So it's just I like writing and I like writing in paragraphs and prose far more than bullet points

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:16.670
So it worked out really well for me. Yeah, and so that worked it was the right combination and

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:18.630
You're always adjusting

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:25.670
It's like it is a how the hell do we get from modern testing principles all the way to manager employee relationships?

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:33.750
But here we are, but there is a lot that's important and just you just have to figure out what each other want to move forward

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:39.710
And that's it's an art but we everybody does it 20 or 30 times in their career and it's fine

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:48.440
Just recognize that people are different strengths finders people are different. They want different things. They're motivated by different things

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.880
They enjoy different things and they hate different things

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.420
Don't as long as you don't think immediately assume this is where Myers-Briggs versus well

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.520
just don't assume that everyone's exactly the same and

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:06.670
You'll be fine and I can even tie that back to make a big loop and get back to AI which we haven't talked about

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.590
It's been 45 minutes. Oh my god. If you can get all the back to AI

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:16.350
That's the problem when you have AI right pros AI. There's no human element. It's like you're

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.770
It's it's good. It's kind of good. It's accurate

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:25.570
But it kind of doesn't look like something a human would write yet

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:34.310
I don't know if I agree with I do agree you do I do you do agree with your own statement?

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:40.110
Because I use well, you know, we use chat GPT and the thing I wanted and I want to add a whole thing

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:42.670
I asked before I'll just shut up in a minute here

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.310
But I was trying to weave it back to AI but it's far too late

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.810
We have to close up in a few minutes

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:51.310
But the the people are coming in from the street to figure out what's going on. I

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:58.990
Asked chat GPT before we started I did I use the Allen bot that Jason Arbin made. Thanks Jason and

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:05.790
I can't find the window anymore. I have so many tabs open and I asked it for some topics

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.570
So what are some new and interesting topics Alan and Brent should discuss?

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:16.560
On the A B testing podcast and we're gonna do this next time and then I'll get all your thoughts because I've used like

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.800
80% of the

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.720
recording time on this podcast

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:28.740
It said given the wealth and experience and evolving perspectives of Alan Brent in the field of software quality a fun new and relevant

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.120
topic for the A B testing podcast could be

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:38.070
Worth the drumroll sound effect. Good. It's good. The role of AI in modern testing hype or hope

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.950
It which is a discussion and a talk I would never give we haven't done that

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.030
I do I do want I think there is

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:55.030
strong potential for AI in testing and the strong potential is in none of the things people are talking about and

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.580
How's that for a teaser?

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.150
Brent what's on your mind?

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.630
What topics can you remember from this podcast?

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.390
AI

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:13.430
The one from 30 seconds ago nice nice work. Give me one second. I'm trying something out right now

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.190
Brent is

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:23.750
Well, we're talking before well, he's trying that we were talking before the podcast started and I Brent stood up to go get the door

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.990
He's wearing pajama pants cuz it's Friday, you know, it's we're working from home

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:32.470
Friday and I'm wearing shorts because I took a little break to go to the gym later and

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.310
I

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:38.430
Learned a phrase. I think I might have shared this before we're sharing again

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:43.070
For those of us that work from home and we wear shorts and sweats all the time and then we decide we're gonna go out

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.110
In public we have to put on our hard pants

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:53.040
That I completely understand and everybody knows what it means as soon as you say it even though it's a made-up board

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.340
I love it. I gotta go grab some hard pants. I'll be ready in a minute. I

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:03.080
often

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:09.940
Forgo that just to be quite honest. I'm like, you know what all of the naughty bits are hidden. I'm going outside screw it

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.660
You know, I'm trying to look good

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:21.180
Hey, if you I do have one thing I want to mention at the end here once you're done here with your little chat

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:25.620
GPT thing which is providing no value right now. What's the thing you want to mention Brent? Oh

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.080
Okay

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.480
No, you you so I'm an ideater like the strength stuff, right?

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.070
Am

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.390
You're an idea monkey

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.630
Which means I connect the dots between things and when Alan says oh

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:47.310
I can't write it like a human being and we we had just briefly talked about Myers-brakes. I'm like, oh I have never tried

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:55.880
But what I just did is I said, all right summarize AI and testing and it wrote a bunch of words

00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.680
And I don't really care. Okay, but then I said now rewrite it as an ENFP

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.590
Okay, and now actually rewrite as

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.290
I am

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:13.090
TP that's both of us. Oh, yeah

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.740
Riveting

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:23.780
Now what would be interesting in pattern matching and maybe I don't know if a gen AI could do this or some some graph paper

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.740
But take all of things strengths finders working genius

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.020
insights

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:36.500
Myers-briggs plot them all because we're different we're the same on a Myers-brake but different everywhere else kind of map

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.060
the the

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.820
Communication work what and what Alan enjoys DNA

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.920
So I

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.120
Whoa

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.880
That's getting another homework assignment. No, no, that just registered like for me like

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.230
so

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:01.870
You've made fun of me on this in the past like straight. I have Myers-brakes

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.170
I think in a general sense is actually really good

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:10.950
Strike finders as you know, I think it's a lot better, right?

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:18.330
What was the the the big big five big six is another one? Yeah, right and I'm like

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.520
What fun for for me on this one is?

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.630
Okay, if I had Alan

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.380
Take all of these tests and then I betcha

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:35.460
I don't even need to feed the data on it because I bet you open AI already knows

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.920
I'm like, whoa

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:55.140
What could I do with that? Yeah, it knows it like

00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.060
So now I have your test. I just

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.720
Narration what it knows is Brent types in what is ideation and it kind of explained it in the whole Strix finders way

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.840
Can I go? Yeah

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:13.680
Like the fact that it knew I didn't tell its strengths when it pulled it up like it knows what I'm talking about

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.460
well, except it's a

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.220
Anyway

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.970
Ideation kicked in I haven't gotten to the end result

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.530
but my

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:35.010
Ethicometer just triggered. I'm like, oh shit if I had that plus open AI I

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:42.180
Bet you I could do a lot of really cool, but also a lot of really dangerous things

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.140
Well, there's some there's again there's power in knowing

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:52.020
What how that people are different from you and how to work with them and what motivates them

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.620
There's a bunch of different tools that let you figure that out

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.040
Some tools are about figuring out what you're good at

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.860
Which is also what gives you energy some are purely about what sorts of activities

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:09.900
Give you energy or are difficult for you to do about figuring out what you what's in your wheelhouse dial it in as a manager

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:16.580
It becomes a cool orchestration device. So all good stuff. We've talked about this stuff before we're running out of time

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.740
We did not we got to get out of here Brent. This is all good stuff

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:24.060
We forgot to mention last time and we will not do another recording in June

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:28.500
But I did want to call from a be testing a happy pride month everyone. Oh, yeah

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.480
Yep, I think I

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:38.380
Can cut this Brent if you want, but I think it's no for Brent and I we both have gay children and we're

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.980
We love them just as much and they're awesome

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:46.100
And I'm happy we live in a little bubble of a part of the world where they're they're safe doing that

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.100
It's not that way everywhere in the US or in the world. So

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.340
Just get out there support your support your community get out there for your pride parades. We have a

00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:00.740
block party up on the hill just just treat people fairly and be nice and and

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.700
Just everybody's different, but they're all awesome. Well, they're not all awesome

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.380
I know a couple people who aren't but most people are awesome

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:15.490
Most all people are awesome in their correct environment

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:22.090
Yeah, sometimes in prison right? You know that anyway, I think this has been episode

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.770
204

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:31.410
200 and whatever 200. Well, it doesn't matter because they're all the same. We'll see you later. I'm out
