WEBVTT

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.820
test the modern testing podcast join your hosts Alan and Brent I am mindless

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.100
agile robot I must iterate as we talk about software engineering software

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.140
quality leadership and whatever else comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.300
hello everyone howdy we're back again where Brent and I after on our 99th try

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.720
we'll try and actually record a podcast practice makes perfect listen I don't

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.130
know why it's every time it's hard I come to Brent's house well it's Microsoft

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.850
it's his office but it's actually a conference room near his office and I

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.080
plug all the stuff in and every time it's different and somehow on our digital

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.360
mixer buttons get pushed and knobs get turned while it's just sitting in a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.000
backpack I just don't understand how these things happen we are taking

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.440
applications I suppose for a full-time sound engineer there's no pay but that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.460
will be equitable with the pay that Brett and I put in so that's good yeah

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.460
it will be fair you'll get paid exactly as much as we do yes that's true but

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.380
yeah yeah or if you just want to volunteer some recording space where we

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.860
can just set up all our stuff and leave it set up all the time and just we'll

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.340
just go there and record be like the A B testing studios oh that's a good idea

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.660
and again we can't pay rent but we're looking for a free place to do that oh

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.500
maybe if you live close by and have a spare bedroom when you set yourself up

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.300
in there we'll just show up one morning every other week or so and I wonder

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:10.660
actually probably unannounced could we register as a nonprofit and then you know

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.580
well we're not gonna pay rent but could that person then use rent as maybe

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.540
maybe I might be willing to consider doing the effort to look at what it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.300
takes to consider being a nonprofit all right so how I don't know I got there

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.020
because I like what I was what today you brought in a just a crap load of extra

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.700
yeah over on over to my right as you can see from our video feed stop looking

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.700
on the internet for our video feed you don't want to see us we don't have one I

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.900
have a whole bunch of extra piles of stuff which I have brought in after being

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.620
tested in anticipation of the upcoming because this is episode 99 the upcoming

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.860
episode 100 100 that is three digits so we're gonna we're gonna have or in

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.500
binary we have invited all three listeners to participate so but if you'd

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.300
like if you're one of the three and you would like to be part of that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.740
recording it will be April 12th that 8 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time probably a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.260
few minutes early for a soundcheck you can listen live while we record you can

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.900
see what our podcast sounds like before my wonderful editing happens and have a

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.020
chance to offer some comments ask quick questions and be part of that that

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.900
exciting event you know what else happens you know what happens between now

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.980
today's date which is March 20 something and April 12th two weeks from

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.620
now I do what happens but what do you think happens in fact what happens one

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.040
week from now on April 5th April 5th we should have I mean appropriate in a

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.840
perfect world we would have recorded on April 5th but just stuff came up in our

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.080
recording schedule got shifted but April 5th is what Brent five years of being

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.960
victimized by you on the podcast I was thinking the same damn thing and we

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.280
probably recorded it a few days before that I don't remember how long I took to

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.680
edit back then and please again if you're getting people into the podcast

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.200
don't have them start with episode one just just pick a spot farther into the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.360
series and start from there if they want to go chronologically we were we

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.600
are still learning what to do what to talk about and maybe we'll get it

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.080
down by the time we get that but I'm still thinking we should just go back and

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:53.280
read number just say episode what was it 62 is oh it's actually one and then

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.680
everything else was the prequel we can call it we can call it season two oh and

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.170
we'll just say don't listen to season one it wasn't good that I like that idea

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.170
maybe maybe we're on season three or four now that would but that's a really

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.650
good idea that would screw up everyone's RSS feeds and man they get mad

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.950
when I do that okay episode 99 has a sponsor one of the three is sponsoring

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:36.190
AB testing and what you just said hey you nonprofit sponsor you can sponsor

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.350
AB testing it's massively cheapest practically free and all that money goes

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.430
back into buying stamps and stickers and sometimes equipment we're still in a net

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.230
loss but but it helps out so if we did go nonprofit now you got me thinking

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.550
about it definitely everything we make gets reinvested back into back into the

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.630
show and I would say even if we then look look at us we don't do this for

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:11.590
the money we do it for the love of each other like let's say let's let's say a

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.390
world where and honestly for before we get into the sponsor Brent and I have a

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.550
rule about sponsorship it has to be something that we that we would use we

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.670
think is valuable we think is something that given the right situation like of

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.790
course Brent has to use Microsoft tools for everything but given the right

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.510
scenario this is something we do something we can do Microsoft now but the

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.230
the spirit of what you're saying is absolutely true not only would be

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.270
something that we would use but for me in particular and I think you agree with

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:56.310
this it's very important that it aligns with our our mission which is

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.310
accelerating the achievement of quality and we think it was something that would

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.510
would help our our audience the great thing is is where Brent and I just

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.110
booked together I can just totally edit him out later if I want we'll see what

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.310
happens yeah where was I going I was going oh well as an example I gave a

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.910
talk on an AMA for the ministry of test and ask me anything about modern

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.870
testing guys that a year ago oh something else I want I'll save that for

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.630
a hundred some I'm nice little partnership coming with ministry of

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.910
testing but there was they paid me for that but they also had an option to just

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.390
donate that money back to scholarships etc for their events and if they did

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.390
that they double it so that was a no-brainer to do that but I'm thinking

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.110
let's say we got a whole bunch of sponsors maybe we have a sponsor on every

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.430
episode we're rolling in the dough I would love to turn that into a be

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.710
testing scholarships for testing events for things like that I would love if if

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.110
there was ever and again we're not we don't go out and look for advertisers

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.590
they come to us because they like what we talked about and say I want to be on

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.150
your show and help you guys out definitely that money either goes back

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.190
into trying to make this show better and believe it or not we are trying as

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:17.830
bad as it gets sometimes and I would love to if the circumstances got there

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:24.470
I'd love to use any windfall we get from people actually wanting to support our

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:32.030
show to give back to the community as much as we can we would probably pick

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:38.380
the community but yeah like if we had if there was enough money we keep talking

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:46.350
about you know maybe one day having a test bash here in Seattle right but not

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.590
with the funds we have available well that's something that's still gonna

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.670
happen someday I want to talk about practice test today so thank you Joel

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.550
and co for sponsoring this episode of a be testing as you are aware there's

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.910
definitely no one size fits all in testing for anything this is why they

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.950
built practice test to do it to be a centralized solution that supports

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.670
testing of different types and sizes scripted exploratory automated whatever

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.710
they envision a place for all testing data will reside so that stakeholders

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.670
can generate the information required for their needs I want to pause here it's

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:31.320
obviously some copy but we we've talked about this before but and you know from

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:39.000
being in definitely firmly entrenched in a data job but but preparing the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.480
information the information that a that a IC needs versus the line level manager

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.040
versus the director of engineering is different oh for sure so being able to

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.640
spin that that testing data that generated data in a variety of ways is is

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.080
a pretty critical yeah and the thing I think that is was pretty interesting

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:11.650
about their approach is they have a mechanism for generating that data

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:18.670
regardless of how it sort of sits right because one of the problems we used to

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:26.770
in one of the early episodes and you get ten architects in a room brainstorming a

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.890
new automation design you walk out with 12 designs of course right and of

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.370
course they will all have different schemas they will all have different

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:44.070
process models they will all be different so this tool does help to coalesce

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.190
that into the information that's valuable another issue they're trying

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.670
to solve is that as we create and run more tests and more types of tests we

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.690
end up with a whole bunch of data in the system having a lot of data can

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.010
actually be harmful if you can't control it so they introduced a

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.770
revolutionary approach to data organization instead of burying the data

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.050
in folders and within folders within folders within folders they allow users

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.650
to work with hierarchical filter trees that are based on the same data it

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.210
enables teams to organize information in more flexible and even multiple ways

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.330
things we just talked about a little bit before helping you generate better

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:28.290
reports and I would say more contextually more contextual reports and

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.210
visibility into product and process at practice test they believe that the

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.890
testers job is not to test for the sake of testing I would say that modern

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.410
testing definitely feels that way as well but to create visibility and provide

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.010
information that will help the team release better products and do it

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:50.450
faster for that reason having a platform that supports testing is not enough and

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.450
they put a lot of effort into their dashboard and reporting modules which is

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.130
damn cool to make sure that that's that they didn't write that part I

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.610
added that to make sure any stakeholder can get the relevant information they

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.010
need in the format they need it and when they need it so practice test is

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:17.400
targeting testers yeah but if you are if you understand why we wrote up the

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:24.280
modern testing principles and you agree with them there's absolutely no reason

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.800
and and when Joel showed us that I brought this up there's no reason why

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:36.220
this isn't a tool to help you in your process of coaching developers how to

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:43.960
move the test or how to yeah yeah yeah right now in their own reporting right

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:52.280
exactly it's right that the one of the problems a lot of the times is is us and

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:58.870
test we've created this very rich language and this lingo and we've kind of

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:05.380
in some regards I think we've purposely obfuscated it to make it unattractive

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:11.940
for developers to sort of take over or to generate a job that only we could do

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:17.660
thus celebrating the bottleneck versus getting rid of the bottle exactly and so

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:24.860
this this absolutely helps to grease the wheels there reduce the friction on

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.380
that that cultural transfer we talk about over and over again throughout my

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:38.860
entire career one test complaint is how do we move it upstream shift left yes

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:44.380
shift left that's that's actually the new move it upstream isn't it well this

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:54.900
is a good left shifter it is it is although yeah maybe I want to take that

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:01.700
back because I think left shift is I think it would fad I shift I have mocked

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.220
that phrase for many many many moons triple dub dot practice test PR a CT

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:13.180
I T EST comm check them out thanks Joel and co for sponsoring this episode and

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:19.030
I hope that some of the three or maybe will we ever have four listeners

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.710
probably not but I hope some of the three check it out and see if they can

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:28.260
use it for their teams cool let's you ready to move on to the topic du jour oh

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.700
yeah and actually the other thing I'll say on that one is Joel's on the slack

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.140
channel if you're not one of the three dot slack calm you can go to modern

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.220
testing org and find a link to sign up and hang out with us yourself and you

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:49.700
know I'm sure Joe will completely agree to personally being your hands-on

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.060
support for practice yeah the cool thing about practice and one thing I

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.660
didn't bring up and I should so the never-ending ad here but it's worth it

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.860
is that it doesn't try and be a kitchen sink it doesn't try and be everything for

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.900
everyone it it's it's small and focused and which means it's easy to get wrapped

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.380
up and learn and it's a small company and you will get a lot of love yeah

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.660
Joel is on the road helping people out with practice test all the time and

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:20.240
and just a good tool with great results I said I see a lot of real

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:26.160
solid possibilities with that tool definitely or tool set right right I

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.000
think it's great where it is right now but it I think there's a lot of things

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.680
that would be very easy for them to add that would make it super powerful cool

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.360
all right we have let's get into right here about 15 minutes into the podcast

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.150
let's talk about postmodern Alan yeah are we ever gonna close the cliffhanger

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:54.330
yeah bear almost I'm this is like here soap opera where I stretch it out till

00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:01.710
episode 100 when it finally everything finally lasts but I know it it will it

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:09.440
will because there is pressure on me to decide what to do and in order so

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.180
bread doesn't know all the story so I'm gonna I'm gonna back up gloss over what

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:19.420
he and I talked about originally a month and a half ago but first off is it at a

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:25.100
point right now I'm out of the bottleneck it's just waiting on a decision

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.820
from Alan it's mostly waiting on a decision for me but that decision

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.060
requires me talking to two more people on Monday to get a little better feel

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:39.850
we talk about what that is in a moment so can you can you defer that another

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:48.360
two weeks no because we could just use 100 and just have the the three decide

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:54.960
your fate no yeah I think I know what I'm going to do it's gonna be I think

00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.130
largely obvious as I go through my thought process let's get started to

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.210
recap those who haven't heard the episodes of Alan I joined unity two

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:09.750
years ago it's been a blast we talked about very early on I figured out my

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.950
team was really a community more than people that worked for me the modern

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:19.470
testing principles evolved out of what we have been talking about on the show and

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.230
I started putting those things into practice to see what would work again

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.820
people some people are afraid of principle seven which the second half

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:33.060
says paraphrased you may not have the need for a tester on your team anymore

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:38.150
as a dedicated testing specialist I should say so what's happened is over

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.390
the two years I've slowly moved my entire team

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:49.590
well most of my team to not work directly for me and as of our latest

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:56.430
reorg into a brand new division at unity I have dissolved the remainder of my

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.910
testing organization and retired my cost center there is no longer a cost

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:07.620
center associated with my team they all work elsewhere so what does that mean

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.300
what happens when you work yourself out of a role well the good news is is I

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.620
have not worked myself out of a job the fun part has been over the last few

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:22.660
months figuring out what is the new role for me within my job at unity and I

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.380
talked a little bit talked to Brent a little bit I was exploring the idea with

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.740
our leader of our new division over running a large part of the

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:39.680
organization definitely there's some challenges in that a lot of meetings I

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:48.270
imagine I've I felt pretty good about how I've managed people at unity and but

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.740
really more about how I've built a community and help them become leaders I

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:59.500
thought that would be a good rule for me we had some more conversations and

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:06.460
there is a larger need I will go into complete details to directly manage one

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:12.220
of the feature teams which will grow basically a dev manager role in a team

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.980
that would start off moderately sized and grow very very quickly to be quite

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:23.080
large building a lot of internal and external services services for game

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.550
developers and enabling other teams at unity to build services even if they

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.790
didn't have that services background I thought that sounds fun that's in my it's

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:41.730
up my alley I like this it's it's a lot of things I like to do but I also took

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.740
some time to reflect and what are the things that I like and what are the

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:53.510
things that I don't like and which is a good exercise that anyone going back to

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:59.190
Brent talking about the potential of eighth principle it's like how do you

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.990
take care of yourself and while I don't believe it's a principle I think there

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.550
are some things for anybody whether you're doing modern testing or not as

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.070
you're growing in your career think about especially when you get old like

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.630
me you really want to do the things that are most that you enjoy the most

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.920
I feel like the biggest challenge for you I'm gonna interrupt there yeah

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.970
please please that's a good place to stop there there's I don't think you

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.290
being old is what matters I think this is true I only got a few years left Brent

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:36.650
no I know but you know the corollary is is hey if you're fresh in in the

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:41.370
industry you know you can afford to spend the next 20 years of your life

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:47.170
you know hating your job right and so what I what I tell people is when you

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:56.160
think about a job change think about three things number one what do you do

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.920
well okay that's one set think of a three circle Venn diagram what do you do

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:11.460
well what do you like to do and what can you be paid to do like you want to

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:18.800
find you want to find the sweet spot for all three and there's an old

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:26.360
Confucius saying right it's find the job that you love and you will never work a

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:34.460
day in your life right and I've always had jobs I've loved and I'm gonna see if

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:40.620
I can find I can't find it I'll talk about a little bit let me go through I

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:47.620
and there's yes that's relevant I think it's a lot one thing I've noticed is or

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:54.380
I've encountered is that that Venn diagram is much easier to execute on well

00:21:54.380 --> 00:22:00.140
and not leave your company if you're at a big company like Microsoft Unity still

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:06.980
2,000 people and actually that'll come into play here in a minute so I

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.660
definitely can find all three and and to be clear this is you kind of see

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.540
where this is going this is the job offer to me it's good it's very good a

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:23.690
lot of fun a lot of challenge but on reflection I started to wonder if it was

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.410
the best role for me and let me tell you about the steps that I go through when I

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:32.650
think about changing jobs the high-level statement is never go from a job always

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:40.930
go to a job and more importantly never define best role based off of a fear so

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:49.610
no right right so one exercise I do when saying when evaluating a role is to

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:54.770
think about what are the three things that I dislike the most about role a or

00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:02.420
role B and when I thought about this this Dev Manager role again to be

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.460
ultimately clear that it would be a cool job a lot of people are really excited

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:14.940
for me to take this role but in the end I want to do what's best what I feel

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.340
right now no no no I'm trying I'm just trying to tell a story so I reflected I

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:26.240
thought you know I've been a Dev Manager before you can count a little

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:36.060
bit of you know I ran infrastructure and tools on on Microsoft Teams I forgot the

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.780
name of the damn thing but then I reflected back I thought oh my god I

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:49.310
forgot way way back in 2001 maybe I was the dev lead for the the shell on

00:23:49.310 --> 00:24:00.160
Windows CE I was gonna say and I I totally forgot and that was it was that

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:07.160
experience that made me double down on test because what I realized at that time

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:13.040
is there are a lot of people that like making things they're excited by feature

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.800
work and for me fixing bugs and fixing process and making things better and if

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.880
you'd never phrase for it but accelerating the achievable quality was a

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.320
much more satisfying role for me than making things and when this role has

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.480
been sold to me it's a lot about making things I thought wait a minute I've made

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.520
things before and it was fun but it wasn't exciting for me oh you know for

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:45.790
me so when when I went to Bing as as a Dev Manager the thing that I found

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:51.750
actually really surprising and it's aligned with what you said my team

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:56.470
loved building features and that's great because we were building a

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:04.150
product and we needed to do that but I spent my time fixing bugs and it just

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:11.140
made me happy as a clam to do so and I think that's okay the way I view it now

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:17.640
so that's still kind of what I do although a lot of times I do a lot of a

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.760
lot of the bugs I'm fixing you wouldn't argue that they're bugs because a lot of

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.440
times I'm like oh my god I can't believe this was designed this way and

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:34.220
and this bug fix is actually a full architecture re-implementation but I now

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:40.420
very much focus so I wouldn't use your old winstays because the world is very

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.540
different yeah no no it is it is and and to be clear that was a reflection

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.920
exercise and the way I would run the dev team would be much more like I ran the

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:57.800
teams developers so I it would definitely be and I would have and I would or will

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:04.080
I haven't made a decision yet have some of my old QA team members working for me

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.060
in and actually one of those one of those people is pretty much doing a

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.380
DevOps role entirely right now you just implemented a feature flag service

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.500
anyway yeah I haven't heard the downside yet so no no so the other the

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:27.170
other aspect to that that the way I look at things now is I own the business no

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:32.690
and again it is it to be clear let me finish up my thoughts on this let me move

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:38.010
on to what I'm fit my other my other choice if I can get through this so the

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.650
other thing is is I this team will grow and I like hiring I think it'd be

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:47.140
fun but and of course it's a it's a leadership role so I'm working I'm on

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.500
the leadership team for the division so we're talking about option two now

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.420
we're talking about option one still okay so I would still work across the

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.420
organization on a bunch of different things and I like that but I kind of

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:03.820
like again reflection time let's go back to Xbox one where I worked across an

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:09.300
entire organization helping them do better at what they needed to do again

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.620
before we had a name for accelerating the achievement of quality it started off

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.180
with just the test team then it was all the console team and then I was

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.500
communicating and coordinating across Xbox live and then game development

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.740
teams I like having my hands in a lot of different places you know this from

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:30.420
building communities at Microsoft there is something I like that I like the

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.470
challenge of influencing a bunch of people that don't necessarily work for

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.270
me I've been able to do that quite a bit at Unity but I think I would have

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.950
a less chance of that in this role that's okay I think it's definitely

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:50.340
still some cross-divisional leadership opportunities and then as I mentioned

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:56.340
before so I said wanted something I've done before to it it's a little narrower

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:01.940
in perhaps some narrowing in scope and then the thing also I mentioned for us I

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.260
like fixing processes and problems more than making things not like I don't

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.700
like making things and I wouldn't make it in a way that would be awesome so but

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:16.340
let's be clear I haven't shut the door on this currently offered job yet no the

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:22.500
issue is it's or at least what's in my head it's how you're distinguishing

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:29.170
things right processes and problems is gonna occur in either role yeah yeah so

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:33.410
let me actually before you speculate let me actually talk about the other option

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.170
I'm thinking about all right and I'll decide well before the next episode and

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:43.050
and talk about it on the slack team if you want to know the details as part of

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.450
this is great it's actually it's wonderful to have an opportunity to

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:52.810
explore both of these things and but and I have two roles that I am debating

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:57.790
and you probably tell I'm leaning a little bit towards the second one but I

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.030
haven't made a decision yet at all I'm talking about moving to work full time

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.790
in our ads organization our modernization organizations more than

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:11.830
just adds modernization monetization money money making which is ads in app

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:16.590
purchasing including those that's the other option yes and so let me talk about

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:21.230
that role a little bit of course longtime listeners will know that the QA folks

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:26.870
in that organization used to be part of my org and it's one of the first QA orgs

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.350
I moved back to work for the dev teams and many of those a couple of people are

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.710
still the largely a testing specialist role within that organization but most

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.670
of them are just full-time developers in that organization that happen to have

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.950
some extra quality knowledge it's a team of about a hundred and sixty engineers

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:47.070
okay and of course there's a bunch of product managers defining what we're

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:52.630
doing making deals with customers developers advertisers etc so the

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.070
overall goal in that org is to increase quality accuracy and velocity of

00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:00.350
offerings offered by the group so the role there is to work across all of the

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:06.040
ads engineering teams helping them again accelerate their achievement

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:12.160
quality but working across all the different organizations it's about what

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.600
all of their all of their dev teams are between three and seven people so what

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:22.060
shippable quality in that context like I think I think I and probably the

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:27.760
listeners probably have a a good fuzzy idea shippable quality from option one

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:36.960
but shippable quality option two more money less friction like how do you

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.480
define success so far I've even got into the details yet but I think it would be

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.160
better predictability and better quality better predictability by scheduling and

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:52.840
a good predictability in the project management the teams largely do

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.880
project management the same but there are definitely some tweaks there and

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.560
again this is a team I've worked with tangentially non-stop for the last two

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.880
years and also quality so the way you just described I just want to be clear

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.580
it sounds like synchronized cat hurting a lot of cat hurting they need some cat

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:16.980
hurting and the way the the VP put it he says says we have an org that thrives

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.420
pretty well in chaos but we want someone who could bring just the right

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:28.360
amount of order to our chaos and I like doing that so and also definitely

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.120
improving uptime service quality predictability deployment rates helping

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.980
manage expectations appropriately between engineering and product management in

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:47.580
fact the last two people I need to talk to mainly for me to interview them is a

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.780
couple people from the product management team to understand what they

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:58.600
see as bottlenecks what they see as issues with engineering probably a lot of

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.480
what I would do is manage expectations on reality on one yes we can deliver this

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.720
thing that'll make a ten million dollars but if we do it by the date you want

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.720
will probably lose five million in the first week as a total made-up example a

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:23.840
little bit of project management coaching a lot of quality coaching a lot of

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.520
really it's a role again that I'll work myself out of eventually I assume but

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:37.670
one I think it's a lot of growing the quality culture within the team to more

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:44.150
advanced levels so do you have a team in this option probably not initially

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:52.110
okay I would probably work as an as an IC initially so what you described to me

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:57.990
almost sounds like an engineering evangelist type I don't know if I'd

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:02.390
call it that and actually who's a good thing is like I'll give a few more

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.910
highlights of the role I'm gonna figure out what we'd call it if I if I end

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.810
up taking this role cuz I don't know what to call it I kind of want to get

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:15.650
out of the quality director you know quality name so anyway so I'll just give

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.660
you the list of things the VP sent me he gives him some examples adding processes

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.900
and frameworks for tracking dependencies and communication between teams as teams

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:29.580
as teams grow from small to large as you know from reading Brooks or

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.380
Weinberg or anyone else the ability to communicate among them decreases so

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.380
helping with that helping facilitate communication making sure there's some

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.180
consistency and quality bars and especially like a definition of done

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.300
developing a culture of autonomy and quality and transparency you figure out

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.660
what do we are there things that we can measure things like that visibility on

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:58.780
how teams how people on teams are allocated make sure it's because we're

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:03.780
looking across all teams yeah I know the title okay let me finish here and

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.260
then track we have some ongoing programs like the team is it's 60%

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:15.380
feature work 20% innovation you know 20% time and then 20% tech debt and but

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.140
teams don't track it sometimes don't use it right it's like it's maybe coming up

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:24.580
some ways to keep those things on track so basically helping the engineering VP

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.660
of that group achieve his vision by doing all the magical things that I know

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:34.320
how to do okay I'm ready what are you gonna call it because this was this

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:45.070
role sounded super familiar and I finally realized where it came from and in the

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:53.850
safe framework oh god just lost our three listeners why I think safe is a

00:34:53.850 --> 00:35:00.620
fantastic framework I did this role that you're describing is known as the

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:06.260
release train manager huh I don't know if I like that you got anything better

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:13.910
no actually because a release train manager is an essence a communication

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:19.940
role and and uh and uh so you can think of it like a train station the job is to

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:28.940
make sure it is to honor the required necessities from the business team right

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.940
you're essentially gonna be a an intermediary between the business team

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:37.060
and the engineering team is a little bit that's definitely part of the job

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.740
right but also a lot of hands-on in the engineering team helping them do a

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.780
better job so first off if if I were to go into that role I'm just telling you

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:51.980
the thing I would do is I would immediately go take I would go take a

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:56.980
refresher on safe and that's how I would begin deploying it and saying this

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:02.530
and and if you go do a review on that like the structures all there makes

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:09.270
everyone happy happy happy okay and offline next time we do launch I can go

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.990
into more detail if it's useful when we can set up once sooner if the pending

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:19.490
decision now that said if I were to go into that role and I've been in the role

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:27.100
of release train manager once in my career this was about four months

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:33.900
before I finally left that team and came to where I'm at now okay it is

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:42.520
essentially a super duper release manager which doesn't it's an important

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:48.270
role does not appeal to me when you started talking about the monetization

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:54.950
stuff that sudden sound actually pretty exciting from my current role right as a

00:36:54.950 --> 00:37:00.550
data scientist focus on customer behavior and improving business KPIs but

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:05.630
that's not where you went with the discussion no and but I think that I get

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.990
what you're saying and I remember reading enough about safe to remember this role

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:15.290
but I think the difference is the amount of coaching maybe the release

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.930
train manager does that aren't recall that but just a lot of helping teams

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:24.330
figure out how to approach quality better and we'll use they're already

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:30.820
using my quality culture transition guide and helping and again I guess the

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:36.540
release train manager would include some coaching on how to project manage you

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:43.480
would essentially be Unity's agile coach or that division tell you so little or

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:50.170
that yet until you solidified into a pure RTM role at which case maybe I've

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:55.330
worked myself out of that role on something else it once so that's exactly

00:37:55.330 --> 00:38:01.810
what I did is is actually I was the RTM I had a person shadowing me when I left

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:06.710
he just took over okay yeah cool anyway those are the things I'm thinking about

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:15.510
both very different different challenges different drawbacks again in this as I

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:20.510
mentioned initially the role would be an IC role and I've actually really grown to

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:27.830
like managing people Unity so I will miss doing that but I think that will be a

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:31.750
temporary thing I'm not sure what I need a team for but we'll figure that out as

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:36.550
we go but that's I'm gonna offer you another option what's another option not

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:41.690
coming back to Microsoft no okay good the only time I would suggest that

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:52.180
would be if I had an opening and that's for entirely selfish reasons no if you

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.580
were to take my suggestion around applying the safe framework and looking

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:02.300
through that honestly if based on what I know I don't see a reason why you

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:10.110
couldn't do all of the above well there are different divisions and something

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.590
else to discuss in a longer term someone's waiting for our room so why

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:16.990
don't we wrap it up there okay and we'll find out more in episode 100 again

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:22.870
April 12th 8 a.m. PDT contact me on Twitter or via slack if you want to take

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.910
part we'd love to have you there I'm still Alan after 99 episodes and I am

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:31.630
Brent later bye
