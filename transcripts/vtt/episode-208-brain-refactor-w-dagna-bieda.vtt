00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.460
Welcome to A.B.E. testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.030
Now, on with the show.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.190
Hello everybody.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.190
We are back.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.300
Uh, Brent, say hi.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.860
And those of you that listened to episode 173, which seems like forever ago, probably two

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.460
years ago, we have the return of D'igna.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.060
Oh my gosh.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.100
I didn't ask her to repeat her first.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100
D'igna Bieda?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
How close am I?

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.320
Yes, you are on point, Alan.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320
All right.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.320
D'igna, there you go.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.680
Well, welcome back to A.B. testing.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.760
We are honored to have you here.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.240
It's like you never left, but a lot has happened since then.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.240
I know.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.560
I'm stuck to be here today with y'all.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560
We're excited.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.520
We're going to get right into it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.570
One, just super honored to have you here.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.690
You know, we have, as you know, we have only three listeners and when we get someone actually

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.210
requesting to be on our podcast, it's especially someone who actually is smart and knows what

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.210
they're doing.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.210
I feel very honored.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.210
So it's great to have you here.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
I mean, I feel confused, right?

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.340
Our podcast, smart person, I'm like, ow, what's going on?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.340
Hey, we can fix that with how we're about to talk in a moment.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.340
We are.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.340
We are.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.420
And just as an aside for our listeners, Brett sounds a little distorted now.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.340
I think that should be fixed when we get the audio.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.820
So I'm not going to worry too much about it, but we're going to get started.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.620
So D'igna was just holding up a book.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Dun dun dun.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.000
It's a book called Brain Refactor with a very long, a very long subtitle that I did not

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.200
memorize and nor can I read on the screen.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.400
But OK, let me read it for you.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.280
Let me read it for you.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
Yes, please.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.640
It says optimize your internal code to thrive in tech and engineering and get more success,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.120
fulfillment, money, opportunities, impact and growth.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.800
Because that's what you get when you refactor your brain.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.520
And we talked about this concept a little bit last time when we talked, but now you've

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.320
refined it and expanded or written a whole book about it.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.320
But I'm just going to ask a question.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.240
I think I know the answer to it, but I want you to answer it.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.520
So what inspired you to draw these parallels between maybe we didn't talk about this

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.850
last time, the parallels between programming and the brain?

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.280
It seems so obvious to me now.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.000
And I felt like it's not really a common perspective that people have.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.760
But by having this perspective of your brain being essentially kind of like a product that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.760
has software that you can just update whenever things are not working the way you'd want

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.820
them to be makes it so easy and fast to refactor and deploy changes, right?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.580
And then see better outcomes.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.870
So in my career, when I think about what I always wanted to do, for some reason I was

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.470
always chasing impact.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.670
And at first I thought if I started robotics and build robots, I'm going to make impact.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.160
I'm going to build the future.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.680
Then I moved to software engineering because I had programming classes in my robotics curriculum

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.800
and it paid better.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.440
And I thought if I deploy an app and millions of people have it in their hand, I'm going

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.930
to have an impact.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.690
And that felt fun for a moment, for a few years.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.930
But then I burned myself out.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.610
And then I realized as I was going through therapy sessions to get help with burnout

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.130
and some other things, I realized that having a conversation with someone who gets what

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.980
it is that I was going through and could help me change my perspective, that was the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.020
impact I was chasing all along.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.660
So the therapist had a massive impact on my life and perspective and it quickly improved

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.180
after just several sessions.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.340
And now this is what I do with my coaching clients as a coach, right?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.900
Because I moved from programming computers to reprogramming human minds.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.700
So essentially, this is a very long answer.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:43.940
No, no, it's a great answer for context because Brent and I also are both fans of getting

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.500
feedback through therapy.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.540
And I have learned indirectly a lot of leadership technique by doing the things my therapist

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.540
does.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:01.780
Like, I've learned how to get past managing the work and managing the person by using

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.100
some of the skills I've observed myself.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.830
So one of the things I talk about a lot is just it's so important to reflect and think

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.830
about what you've done.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.270
A lot of head nodding as I was reading through some of this stuff, just thinking about, and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.590
I'm going to get into a whole bunch of it.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.910
I don't want to jump around too much, but just a whole bunch of thinking about what you're

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.430
doing and being purposeful about how you're approaching the work and not just doing the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.430
work.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.430
And I love that you brought up burnout.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.140
Again, I'm going to bring that up again in a minute.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.540
Brent, did you want to add on that before I go on to the hard stuff?

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.620
Yeah, no, there's a couple of things that what D'Agna said reminds me of, right?

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:52.150
Yes, years ago when I was a metal manager, I'm a frontline manager now, but years ago,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.910
one of my leads came to me and she said, I never met someone that was as good with technical

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.710
problems as with people problems.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.270
Because normally your manager, they're either a people person or they're a tech person.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.090
And I said, thank you, that is actually something I strive for.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.330
And I said, would you like to know my secret?

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.970
And of course, she said yes.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.570
And I said, I don't see them as separate problems.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.410
The only difference between the problems is just one thing.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.600
If it's a code problem, I can put any programmer on it to fix it.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.160
If it's a people problem, there's only one programmer that I can assign to fix it.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.440
And that person has to be motivated to do so.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.910
So I spend my job trying to convince that programmer to fix it.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:52.990
And for those who aren't following along, the programmer is whoever is having, it's

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.750
the brain of the person who is having difficulties moving forward.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:05.260
And then on impact, I thought this is where D'Agna was going to go, but on impact, right?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:17.290
I learned many years ago that I will never provide even medium to long term impact on

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.180
any of the engineering tasks that I do.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.510
My impact is going to be through the people I train.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:35.900
Now, just as an aside, I did do an automation years ago and that thing lasted close to 15

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.900
years.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.020
But now that's dead.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:47.010
And that type of automation, it usually gets rotated through every three to five years.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.370
So the fact that it survived that long was fantastic.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:56.250
But 10 years from now, no one's going to remember the data science or the code that

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.810
I wrote today because we're changing things too fast.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:05.050
But the people I pissed off or the people who view me as their favorite manager ever,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.470
they are going to remember me.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.890
That's who I'm impacting.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.890
Yeah.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:22.330
So it's funny, just today for my Five for Friday series on angerweasel.com, I read

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:31.310
an article, I posted about an article, talked about how we should pay our engineers to stay,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.310
don't let them leave.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:37.050
And they brought up a point that people who have been at a company a long time know a

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.530
lot about execution at that company should pay to recruit them.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:47.490
But while I agree with that part mostly, I think a lot of people equate years in the

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.690
field to how much they should be getting paid.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.770
I've been doing this for 20 years.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.370
I should make the same as other people making 20 years, but it's not.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.050
People progress differently.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.730
And one of the things you talk about, you brought it up in the introduction a little

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:03.170
bit too, is people get stuck in their career despite being deeply technical and being

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.690
able to be a great coder.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.330
What are some of the common mental bugs you've seen in engineers that hold them back?

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.650
Yeah.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.330
I like to call them either bugs or inefficiencies.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
And again, therapy kind of works like a debugging session, right?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:26.250
You jump into that mental code and you start understanding, except it's not line after line,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.250
file after file.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.650
It's more like memory after memory, belief after belief.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.290
And that's what you're debugging there, right?

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:40.000
So Brent, just piggybacking on what you said, having impact through people rather than products,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.400
in the way that I see things, you had put some programming in their minds and that's

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.040
why it's lasting.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.040
Those lines of code that were probably not going to be refactored anytime soon in their

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.040
mental legacy code base.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.840
But what I've seen over and over and over again in my own career as an engineer, as

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:04.120
well as the clients that I currently coach, a lot of the time there are four common obstacles

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.320
that stop you from getting that impact, getting that promotion, getting that success, however

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.040
you want to frame it, that you're chasing.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.380
And that's imposter syndrome, burnout, trouble dealing with other people, and self-marketing

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.380
struggles.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:26.980
So in my book, I essentially dive into how brain works similar to code and how you can

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.300
apply your programming skills to refactor whatever is not working.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.620
And then there are remaining chapters that talk specifically about those obstacles and

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.860
case studies of my clients who had overcome them.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.100
So again, it's imposter syndrome, burnout, trouble dealing with other people, and self-marketing

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.100
struggles.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.180
And when it comes to trouble dealing with other people, because we were just talking

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.460
about that too, how sometimes you need the person who has the issue just upscale,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.380
like update something in their programming so that they can get past their problem.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:09.300
I see a lot of the time that in our engineering education, we tend to overvalue technical skills.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.460
And then the people skills are completely dismissed.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:20.060
Like, people, but I mean, as engineers, we create products for other people and with

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.900
other people, like even if you're the only developer on the team.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.860
So like the people aspect is just inescapable.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:33.380
And that kind of foundational piece of knowledge is missing from engineering agenda.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380
Right?

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.380
Wouldn't you agree?

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.380
I would.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:47.510
I actually even take it further because I have a hypothesis around people who are introverted

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.430
or have a preference to sort of avoid people.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:12:01.670
I think it stems from personal issues that they are attracted to engineering type aspects.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:08.630
And then when they try to grow, right, they do hit that wall that you're talking about

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:15.710
because they've spent their whole life probably successfully minimizing people in it.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:22.660
And then in order to grow, I mean, you just can't avoid it.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:29.260
So I have a question I didn't plan to ask, but I totally believe, I totally agree with

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.940
everything you said, D'Agna.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.940
I do a lot of interviewing.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.420
I always, I threw out my whole career.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.900
I've probably interviewed thousands of people and I always like to look for the people

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.260
who are hungry.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:46.860
And these days, especially human, those human skills, those abilities to deal with people,

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.380
because especially now compared to early in my career, the tech changes so fast, you're

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.290
always going to have to learn new tech.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.850
And I wonder if it's like, are we hiring the wrong people?

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:04.730
Like, I'm going to go off on a tangent here because I have been referring to Daniel Pink's

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.450
A Whole New Mind, the book he wrote, but what are the books he wrote before drive and

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:09.450
drive is fantastic.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.450
A whole new mind is great.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.690
But he talks about the fact that the right brain thinker, the creative thinker, the people

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.610
that and those people have some people skills, but the right brain thinkers are going to

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.250
be the leaders in knowledge work of the future.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.970
And at the time it was like, eh, nice idea, nice little story here, but I'm kind of seeing

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.930
it become more true.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:37.030
So should we, uh, I'm going to ask a weird question because the, the answer is maybe

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.410
not as obvious as I want it to be.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.890
Should we stop, should we hire people on their ability to work successfully and influence

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.610
others?

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:54.290
But most of our emphasis on that and just rely on the fact we can teach them tech because

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.850
to me, that feels a little easier than trying to take these tech people and teach them people

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.910
skills like which, which do you think is harder?

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.910
That's a difficult question.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.430
I'm not going to lie, Alan, there's like so many layers.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.550
I knew it was when I asked, but I couldn't help but think it.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.630
So let me answer indirectly.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:20.790
And let me tell you this, a lot of bootcamp graduates who have former careers that are

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:26.950
not very analytical as I work with them, I see them progress very quickly because they're

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:32.190
smart enough and dangerous enough to know what they're doing in their technical skillset,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:39.350
but they have this balance of valuing technical and the non-technical, the soft, the people

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.070
skills kind of on the same level.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:47.310
And that happened to me in my career too, believe it or not, when I was this subject

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:53.210
matter expert, having years of experience, being really technical, praised for the quality

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.270
of my engineering work.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.270
And I got passed over for a promotion for someone who wasn't even a bootcamp grab.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.310
He was a self-taught dev.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.790
And the reason he got the promotion that I wanted to a team league position, because

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.290
again, he was a fast learner.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:13.030
He could figure out how to solve problems, but he had this master collaborators mindset.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.570
And I was more leaning towards like being a lone wolf, you know?

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:23.290
And he's like, okay, you can be great at solving engineering problems.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:28.090
And if that's all you ever want to do, that's fine, but that doesn't help your

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:29.410
career.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:37.410
So to answer your question, I feel like what's important is to bring that balance in perspective

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.600
in.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.720
And I don't know where does it start.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.200
Does it start with college?

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.400
Does it start with hiring more bootcamp and self-taught devs?

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.080
And with AI right now that can create code for you.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.520
I mean, who knows where the future is going to take us, right?

00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:04.080
But the reality is, again, we're circling back to the fact that people need people skills,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.520
even if they work on hard technical problems.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.480
Even if you have to do a presentation and explain what it is that you just deployed

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.560
in this amazing new feature, or onboard a new person, or help them understand the

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.920
code base that you created so they can take over your work and carry on and probably

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.140
refactor every line of code that you ever written.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.340
You have to be able to have those people skills in order to pass all that knowledge that's

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.280
in your head to theirs.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.930
So I would say that we have to figure out a way to bring that balance back.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.690
And that's kind of what my book talks about too.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:48.990
So I'm hoping to have impact throughout my book now, because I feel like it can change

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:54.270
people's perspective in a way that could potentially shape the future of the tech

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.420
environment of the tech industry.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.660
I agree.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.620
I think there's so many questions to ask.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.260
I do want to mention that I've hired a bunch of bootcamp grads.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.220
I have one on my team now, former physical therapist, crushing it as a developer.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.220
Right?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.220
I know.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.220
I know.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:22.860
Yeah, I really like it because they have such a different perspective is so great.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.820
And at Microsoft when I was there, I was called an as appropriate interviewer.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:32.140
It's a story I've told a couple of times on the show.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.220
I was the last interviewer in the group.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:40.050
So many programmers, like pedigrees that I couldn't even approach, schools I could not

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.550
get into.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:47.150
I talked to them and they know everything about regurgitating algorithms, but they can't

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.550
communicate or hold a conversation or think even.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.590
So it's just weird.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.910
So I like the idea of looking at the brain.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.430
Brent, I have lots more questions, but you want to say something.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:08.260
Yeah, they like, I think we're kind of talking about street smart versus book smart.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.260
Right.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.940
And like we absolutely need to balance.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.620
Like I was thinking about the other angle, right?

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.660
People who have really strong people skills, right?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.060
The, there is a problem with them as well.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.980
They don't want to be in their office writing code.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.460
They hate that isolation.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.940
Like they would, they would prefer to be with others.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:39.020
And so to me, I think, yeah, some balance is necessary.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:47.840
And quite honestly, like I do think that if you are at either the extreme, the way the

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.920
industry is going, like, I don't know where, Dagman will fall on this one, but I'll say

00:18:52.920 --> 00:19:00.030
like the way the industry is going, if you're at either of the extreme, it's probably not

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:06.300
an environment where you're going to thrive because you do have to balance, right?

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:12.480
It's it's, you're a great person, but it'll be like a fish trying to live in the desert.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.540
Yeah.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:21.060
I don't know where you're going next, but I, I, I quickly wrote down in Dagman, I appreciate

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.820
you repeating it twice because I did not write it down fast enough.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:31.420
On your list of four imposter syndrome, self-marketing struggles, burnout, and trouble dealing with

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.420
other people.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:38.570
Um, I know which one blocks me.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:44.770
I'm curious about you before I share which one blocks me.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.530
Well, that's a good question.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.770
You are jumping ahead a little bit, but I want to go into that.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.930
Let me think about that for just a second.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.930
Okay.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:57.250
I have experienced burnout before and I kind of learned how to deal with that.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:02.090
And it was, there was a bunch of factors there and, and, um, I know how to recognize it when

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.090
it's happening.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.860
Um, I've dealt with all four.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.420
I think I have dealt with all four, probably the one I struggle with the most is self-marketing

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.420
struggles.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.980
And that's the same with me.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.580
Cause I, I just, I feel like I'm just going to do a good job.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.140
My work should speak for itself.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.140
If you don't recognize it, I don't care.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.140
100%, 100%.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:31.500
If I do my job right, it speaks for itself.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.140
And if it doesn't speak for itself, I'm not doing my job right.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.160
Dad, no, where do I have it wrong?

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.880
That's such a huge balloony.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:49.140
I mean, let me tell you if that was the case, I would have had that team lead job

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:57.540
I wanted like that, you know, because, uh, no, no, sorry, you wouldn't because what you

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:02.340
told us is that the other guy was better with people and you were good with tech.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.340
Right.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.780
And a manager is going to look at both things.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.870
Yes.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.870
Okay.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.160
All right.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160
All right.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160
Go ahead.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.160
To baloney.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160
Yes.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
Baloney.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:20.360
So in the book, I give this a fun example of like, imagine if you were a painter instead

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.970
of an engineer, and instead of creating a piece of code, you're creating a painting, a piece

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.210
of a painting, right?

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.610
And say that the tools that you have are new tools because you haven't played with them

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.610
before.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.850
So like the brush is not comfortable to hold and maybe the paint dries too fast.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.970
So you're not able to paint as fast.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:46.970
And then there are some meetings that you haven't seen foreseen in your company and

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.570
they just blow up your deadlines and timelines and everything seems to be moving.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.090
And then sprint comes to an end.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:22:02.900
And whenever you deliver what you were meant to deliver, um, I'm trying to figure out

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.500
how to explain, cause I just realized that I'm not going to, like not everyone will

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.020
see the visual of the two paintings.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:17.340
So basically I put in the book, Van Gogh's painting of sunflowers and a kids created

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.420
version of that exact same painting, right?

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:29.000
With the technical skills, whether you create the Van Gogh's version or the five year old's

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.440
version of that same painting, nobody's going to know unless they dive into the code,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.820
unless it causes business issues.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:45.900
So as long as that work that you're delivering is staying somewhat undetected and nobody's

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.420
like paying attention and looking at your hands in peer programming, for example, people

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.460
are just not going to be aware.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:58.340
And then even if people are going to be aware, they are most likely to be the ones who code

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:05.040
with you and don't necessarily have an impact or say over you getting that promotion,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.440
getting that salary increase.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.120
So they are not the decision makers.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.560
If you want to make sure that the decision makers know, you have to be able to talk about

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.440
it because code is not paintings and people don't look at them, don't dive into code most

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.720
of the time and they just don't understand.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.200
So your work is not a painting.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.900
It does not speak for itself.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:31.060
Yeah, I'm a little offended about code isn't painting.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.060
I kind of reject that notion.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.940
My code is art.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.460
But no, I'm kidding aside.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.090
Ask a salesperson if they see the beauty.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:51.330
No, you've put me into an objective mode, which I find is best for me.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:59.050
Like if I can view myself objectively, then I'm able to talk to myself as if I would

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.050
have mentee.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:09.020
Yeah, it's like the impact for me, like I haven't cared about a promotion for a long

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.020
time.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:21.460
What drives me is the opportunities to have larger and larger impact.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:27.740
I am currently a front line manager on more than one occasion.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.900
I have VP level scope.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.620
I love my job.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:42.280
But that said, I would love to find ways to get more people coming to me with their interesting

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.470
problems.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:51.010
That's where I view self-marketing struggles because I hate writing.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.130
I hate tooting my own horn.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.370
I hate all of that.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.850
Like for me, the perfect solution would be to hire a PM and go like, hey, this is what

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:01.850
my team did.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.490
Go write up something nice.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.940
Anyway.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.770
And that makes sense.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.930
Many of us think that way, right?

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.440
Self-marketing is not natural.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:21.950
I would say it's not, what's the word I'm looking for?

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.130
I would say it's not fun.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.050
Not the way that we're brought up.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:33.690
And not because here, like in my book, I explored this idea of having a merge conflict,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.450
right? And it's perfect because it talks about self-marketing struggles in that particular

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.360
example.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:47.470
Let's say you do want to market yourself better, but in your mind, marketing equates to cheating

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.870
or lying to people or selling them things they don't even need.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:58.910
So your marketing model, as long as it is close to dishonesty and you believe yourself to

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:04.830
be an honest person and you want to work in integrity until you update that marketing

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:10.630
model in your own legacy mental code base, you're going to avoid self-marketing.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.630
But guess what?

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:18.010
Whenever you're able to update the marketing model in your own mind, that will allow you

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:23.630
to talk good about yourself in front of other people with integrity of what you believe

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.630
to be true.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:30.030
And that could potentially increase your impact because if people know the value that you're

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:35.260
able to bring to the table brand, they might be like, oh, Brent's my guy.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.380
I'm going to go to him because I know he's going to solve my problem, but they're not

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:44.660
going to know unless you help educate them about what it is that you bring to the table

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.260
as a professional.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.380
I feel like there's an overlap.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:57.460
I'm curious in your perspective on this, Dagnah, between imposter syndrome and the self-marketing

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.900
because maybe I don't self-market because I have imposter syndrome.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.900
Absolutely.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.890
So how does that work together?

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:13.110
So the imposter syndrome, the way I see it, it's essentially because I want to differentiate

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.110
it.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:18.120
I think that sometimes in the tech industry, it's being overused.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.640
Other doubts and worry and feeling like you don't know what you're doing is normal, right?

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:31.720
As long as it doesn't spiral down and make you stuck or make you not take opportunities

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:38.570
or make you step down from a newly acquired position.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:46.220
So the question here is, what do you do when that worry comes up in your own mind?

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.940
If we were to compare it to a log message, how do you debug it?

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.060
Do you just let it sit there and bother you?

00:27:54.060 --> 00:28:01.060
Does it make some routines spiral down and you feel like you're not worthy, like you

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:06.780
shouldn't be there, like everybody will know you're a fraud and you lose your job and you

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.500
shouldn't be doing what it is that you're doing?

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.420
That's imposter syndrome, right?

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.860
It's getting to the point that it's preventing you from growth.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:21.540
The alternative to imposter syndrome is just understanding that growth is uncomfortable

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.580
and you have to go through growing pains.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.060
And I have young kids and my four-year-old came to me the other day, he's like, mom,

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.060
my legs are hurting.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.290
I'm like, buddy, you're growing.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.290
It's normal.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:38.690
I'm sorry you feel that way, but that's just part of growing, part of growth.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:45.850
Growing pains are natural, but we like to avoid discomfort and pain as a society, right?

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.490
And does imposter syndrome impact how you market yourself?

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:55.840
Of course, but it affects it more from the perspective of what is the model of yourself

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.480
that you have in your own mind rather than the model of marketing that I was talking about

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480
a moment ago.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480
Now I can see that.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.640
I think my, and you're absolutely right to bring up the fact that imposter syndrome is

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:14.760
overused and really what I was talking, it's just this self-doubt that comes from

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.480
trying something new or doing something in a different way.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:24.600
I have definitely had those moments of imposter syndrome in my career, but certainly, yeah,

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:30.400
certainly the self-marketing is the biggest thing I need to work on.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.200
I'm going to reread that chapter.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:40.560
I would like to dive into the brain refactor algorithm.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:46.010
I think it's really fascinating and a really good take on how to approach this.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:52.090
Again, I'm sure about self-reflection, but can you walk through how you came up with that

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.170
and walk through the different steps of that brain refactor algorithm?

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.040
Yeah.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:03.440
So, you know, the funny thing about the steps is that I kept doing them with my clients

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.010
as I was coaching them, but I didn't know that this is what we were doing at the

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.600
time.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.230
So when I sat down to actually write the book and tried to figure out basically reverse

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:24.260
engineer my process to then be able to share it in a book content with other people, that's

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.540
when I was able to kind of name the steps.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:34.020
For the first two steps, well, let me probably, it would be smart to say what the steps

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.880
are and then dive into the explanation.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.040
But essentially, step number one is identifying root causes.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.720
And we know that from programming, right?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.480
Whenever there's a bug, we do it all the time.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.320
That's the first thing that we do.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.600
The second step is planning out the refactor.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.360
So once you know what's not working, then you want to figure out what kind of code

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.800
you want to put in that place instead.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800
What is it?

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.210
How are you trying to fix the issue?

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:04.370
In this third step, we want to script new responses.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:10.290
In the fourth step, we build libraries of evidence that support our refactor.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.970
And the fifth step is continuously execute.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:19.250
I was really tempted to call it something similar to CICD, but it just didn't feel right.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.250
Yeah.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.250
I like it.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:27.810
And that first step is something maybe not enough programmers do, just stop and reflect

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.770
on what went wrong.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:35.490
But as Brian Merrick used to say, maybe an example would be good here.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:41.180
Can you walk through an example of what it would be like to walk through these five steps?

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.580
Absolutely.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:50.120
So let's say that you have trouble with self-marketing yourself, right?

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.360
So the first thing you want to identify root causes.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.000
You want to figure out, OK, why do I have trouble marketing myself?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.640
Is it something that I believe about myself?

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.730
Or is it something that I believe about marketing?

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:09.010
Are there any models in the past that I've observed that led me to act that way?

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.130
Maybe my parents were really honest and humble.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.050
And now I'm trying to just model that behavior.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:18.410
And I'm not even conscious that I'm trying to do that, that I'm just repeating a pattern

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.680
I've observed over and over and over and over again growing up.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:27.720
Or maybe it's a cultural thing where you grew up in a certain culture that expected

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.440
you to behave a certain way.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:39.320
You just did because that's what we do as humans who live in tribes and communities and societies.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.080
We just try to adhere to those standards so that we can feel like we belong

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.440
because that's good for our survival.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.720
And that's how you would really dive into identifying the root causes.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:57.350
You want to do the debugging of your thinking processes, of your beliefs.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.550
Because here's something that most of us never hear.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.130
And it's like Psychology 101.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.480
Our thoughts are not true.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.760
Or at least not all of them are.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.930
Although we do assume that they are and we barely ever question them.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:19.850
But the reality is they are artifacts of our lived experiences

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:25.520
and those models that we've inherited in our mental legacy code.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.080
So as we're going to identify the root causes,

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.160
we have to first debug and understand where is this all coming from.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.600
That's really the step number one.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.320
Nice.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.720
And then, so if I'm working through this, and this is,

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.040
I'm just using the podcast for free coaching.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.240
Sorry, I'm going to find my root causes.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.720
Smart.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.480
I do want to say it.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.120
It is smart, but I'm part of the podcast too.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.520
And I would like Dagnah to come back again sometime.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.480
So let's not do her whole book on the podcast.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.680
It is really good.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.280
It's a missing link.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.120
As Jerry Weinberg says in software and technology,

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.140
and technology eventually it's always a people problem.

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.460
And it's just so important.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.420
And I think, I feel like either in a blog post recently of mine

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.730
or one of the podcasts, we've talked about just the need

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.170
to reflect and how important it is.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.290
That's really how I got.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.370
Here's a story I've told a bunch of times.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:42.370
I had been at Microsoft for about five years.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.210
I was in this leadership program.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.210
And one of the things they did was a thing called the MS360,

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:54.250
where they got an extensively long survey sent

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.290
to your manager, to your employees,

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.570
to people you work with in your team,

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.570
people you work with across the company.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.170
And they all fill out this survey.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:02.890
It's extensive.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:04.090
It takes a lot of time.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.450
They stopped doing it because it took too long.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:10.570
And afterwards, I met with an HR business partner

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:12.610
to go over my results.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:17.170
And they said, Alan, everyone you work with

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:20.970
thinks you do great work and get a lot done,

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.050
but they also think you're a bit of an asshole.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.560
And it wasn't until that time I worked with them.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.250
And I just worked on it because that was sort of the way

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.090
people behave.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.130
My role models were that at Microsoft.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:39.490
But that's when I began to take the time

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.970
to reflect on how I was coming across.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.170
And there's just a big leap to say

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:50.690
I can debug and reprogram the way I approach other people

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.650
in my work in order to be more effective.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.130
And then, of course, since then, I've

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:02.690
become infatuated with debugging people, including myself.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.970
And that's where you got to start, really, with yourself.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:06.610
Yeah.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.170
And it's helped a lot.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.970
And I don't think enough people realize.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.330
And maybe that's my next question.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.490
Enough people realize that they need

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:17.650
to reflect and address themselves.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.330
And maybe their work just won't automatically

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.330
speak for themselves.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.810
So why do you think it is that people

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:29.130
don't realize that they need to debug their brain?

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.010
OK.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.290
Can I read a piece from my book?

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:36.970
Because I feel like I found one that perfectly

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:38.250
answers your question.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.130
OK.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:44.010
So there are two paragraphs across a few pages.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.440
So let me dive into the first one.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.600
Everything you do or don't do follows

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.080
your internal mental code.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.720
Your life experiences program you to be who you are,

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.720
think the way you think, and act the way you act.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.160
There's a perfectly valid reason behind everything you do.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.240
I mean, everything, even the stupid stuff.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.840
That reason always falls in line

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.440
with the source code of your mind.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.450
Now, how is that related to self-marketing?

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.490
Perhaps you've received endless cultural messages

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.450
about being humble, staying in your lane,

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.450
not ruffling feathers, or perhaps you

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:26.450
decided to become invisible because that

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:28.410
felt safer in the past.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:32.330
It could have been critical for your physical or psychological

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.610
safety.

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.610
Being invisible may have kept you

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.210
from the attention of someone who scared you.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.690
It was a great feature back then because it

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.650
shielded you from the potential negative consequences

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:46.560
of being seen.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.040
But the problem, as you may notice,

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.640
is that it might bring your talents to people's attention.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.160
So here I talk about receiving compliments

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.120
and getting at ease with receiving compliments

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:02.900
because that helps with self-marketing.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.140
So you realize that you might have wanted to be invisible,

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.340
and then you check in with your mental models

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.780
on vulnerability.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.940
And it turns out there are no good models

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.300
for how to be vulnerable and feel safe at the same time.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.780
In your mind, you'd rather die than put yourself

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.820
in a situation where you're either exposed

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.580
and can be criticized, where overwhelming emotions might

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.580
surface, or where you might get into a conflict situation.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.820
And that's why you opted into not speaking up

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.980
and staying quiet, to avoid conflict,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.380
to avoid criticism, to avoid strong emotions.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.420
In that set of mental models, being invisible,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.380
playing down your achievements, brushing off compliments,

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.520
are all behaviors that make perfect sense.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.720
Those models played an important role

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.760
in your mental programming, optimizing for your survival

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.360
and keeping you safe.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.320
And the thing is, those models are no longer working for you.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.360
They used to back when they were put into place.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.200
And we see it with code all the time,

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.680
when we put a dirty hack to really quickly solve

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.560
a problem that then blows up months later

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.520
because the code has evolved.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.360
But that piece of programming that was beneficial

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.120
at one point in time is now causing harm.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.720
What I realized while you were reading that is,

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.100
your brain programming is always happening

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.670
because five years at Microsoft taught me

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.070
that getting work done was more important

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.430
than leaving bodies in the wake.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.670
And that programming happened because of the way I worked,

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.510
the way I worked with people I looked up to,

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.350
and then it changed again.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.630
It changed from there once I took control

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.150
of who I wanted to be.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.070
But what I was missing to get better at it

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.750
was this framework, which I really, really like

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.550
for looking at yourself.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.310
It makes a lot of sense.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.510
As we've been talking,

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.390
I mentioned I went through the book very quickly,

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:09.230
but as I've been talking,

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.230
I realized that way back at the beginning of the podcast,

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.640
you said, it's just so obvious to me now

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.440
how programming the brain and programming code are the same.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.040
And even in 45, 50 minutes of talking here today,

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.480
I'm beginning to see the same.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.360
I'm not beginning, I am seeing the exact same thing.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.000
It becomes so obvious.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.920
And you cannot see it once you see it, right?

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.520
No, and I will say a similar thing.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.600
Just having you,

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.490
like talking about the self-marketing struggles

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:46.050
and then having you read those paragraphs.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.400
Alan knows a little bit about this.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.720
I'm definitely not comfortable sharing with it on the podcast,

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.760
but I will absolutely say

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:03.420
I was immediately able to connect the dots, right?

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.260
In terms of step one, RCA,

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.780
in terms of my own particular thing.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.900
And I'm like, okay, right?

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.500
And here, we talked about it last time,

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.580
like, and maybe there's a good opportunity here

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:24.900
to go ahead and do the,

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.160
God, what is the word?

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.000
You go ahead and self-market your other business as well,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.200
because, right?

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.520
So when we last talked, and I still,

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.880
like you already mentioned on the podcast,

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.360
sorry, I don't even need to ask,

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.440
you still have clients, right?

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.880
You have room for more, I assume, yes, no?

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.080
Yes, I do.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.400
Okay.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:55.070
I will happily get new clients, absolutely, yes.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.550
So I already have a therapist,

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.910
but I'm just gonna now advertise,

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.710
I'm just in those couple of paragraphs, right?

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.430
The fact that she's taking these problems

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.750
and communicating them in a taxonomy of language

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:15.310
that most, certainly every one of our listeners

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.640
will understand, right?

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.400
It's gonna help connect the dots.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.400
And if you feel like that is something

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.480
that could be even more tangibly helpful to you

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.200
in a one-on-one, right?

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.600
Reach out to themindfuldev.com,

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.120
reach out to DAGNA,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.320
and try to make a connection there.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.690
Like, I've already, like just in the span

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.970
of this conversation, like your book is on order,

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.950
I haven't read it yet, but it's on its way to my house.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.410
And I'll say, yeah, like those connect.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:55.860
Now, I'm absolutely certain I understand the cause of their,

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.620
like I'm not a newbie in this industry

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.740
in any way, shape, or form.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.860
I have learned to manage many of the things

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.180
that a lot of newbies will do in this space, okay?

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.460
But I still absolutely hate self-marketing.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.400
I still absolutely hate doing it.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.220
I do still very strongly believe

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.900
that my work should speak for itself,

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.300
but what you have convinced me to do further

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:30.640
is that, yeah, that's good, but it's not enough, right?

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.280
And so, does that even the refactor,

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.600
like I don't wanna take up the rest of our time on this one,

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.610
but now I'm like, okay, so what would be the refactor?

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.410
What would I want instead?

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.040
What is a better behavior?

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.440
And then there was one thing,

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.760
particularly to our audience,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.060
I didn't hear in your steps,

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.940
and that is, how do you test the refactor?

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.580
Like, we're a testing podcast,

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.950
how do you test the refactor?

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:03.920
Is that part of your steps?

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.080
So, let's look at the reality of creating apps.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.340
Not everybody has a great way to test things, right?

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.560
Or even writing tests,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.160
but everybody will end up getting feedback

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.160
from the end users eventually.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.460
Everybody, if you create an app

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.140
and you never listened to this phenomenal podcast

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.560
and you never cared about writing tests,

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.400
at the end of the day,

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.960
someone is going to use your app or program

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.830
and they're going to give you feedback.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.200
That's how you know when things start working.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.960
Or if there's more stuff that needs to be refactored,

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.920
because maybe there are some other things

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.840
that are coming up, right?

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.320
In the end of explaining all the five steps

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.560
of the brain refactoring algorithm,

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.460
I talk about the merge conflicts.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.080
That's another thing to be on the lookout for, right?

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.360
Merge conflicts, similarly to code in our brain,

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.070
what happens is if you hold two conflicting views,

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:18.050
you will still see yourself being stuck

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:22.860
with the old behaviors or self-sabotaging yourself

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.740
or procrastinating on the things that you really think

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:26.920
that you want to be doing now

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.280
because you've updated the models, the relevant models,

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.760
and things are still not working.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.380
For some people, merge conflicts

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.720
come up as physical sensations in their body,

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.150
more tense neck and shoulders,

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.280
their stomach twisting and hurling,

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.280
or just feeling kind of antsy and not at ease.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:53.760
So...

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.500
How would you differentiate between merge conflicts

00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.190
and let's say work-related stress?

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.310
Would you?

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:05.510
Or would you say it's essentially the same...

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.850
If you feel stress, it might be indicative

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.730
of what you're calling a merge conflict.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.950
So if you're in the process of implementing

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:19.710
the brain refactor algorithm and you notice more stress,

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.750
that's probably related, right?

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.470
It's all about awareness and observation

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:28.110
and understanding kind of how things ebb and flow

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.910
and what might be connected and not.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.710
And it's not really about judgment,

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.340
it's more about just doing the debugging

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.380
and understanding what might be coming into play.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.750
I wanna add an observation on testing,

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.890
going back to my story.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.030
That feedback doesn't necessarily have to be

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.850
someone giving me feedback.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:52.890
What I learned to do,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.010
and I really began to focus on active listening,

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.410
it's become a passion of mine,

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:02.480
like just paying attention to how people are reacting

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.320
to what I'm saying and then in trying in real time

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.220
to match that to how I'm expecting them to react.

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.440
Knowing when I need to change the message

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.880
because of the way people are,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.440
because body language reacting much harder

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.420
in the flat virtual world than 3D world.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.880
I remember I would have people in meetings with me,

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.200
I would ask them afterwards,

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.920
I would do that reflection and ask them like,

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.440
my intent in this meeting was to do this,

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.280
how do you think I did and get some feedback there?

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.280
But a lot of it is just learning to read people.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.800
If I make a change in my brain programming

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.840
that's supposed to affect the way I deal with other people,

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.400
for example, or even the way I do self marketing,

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.720
I'm testing that constantly

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.280
because I can look at how other people

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.420
are receiving what I'm doing.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.900
So we talk a lot about feedback loops on this podcast

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.900
and I think we can use the other humans we're around

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:00.500
as we do these things,

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:05.100
all involve reason people get blocked

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:10.190
is they're human interconnections

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.430
and we can use those to,

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.310
anyway, I'm just repeating myself now,

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:21.470
but lots of observations coming together here, very cool.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.710
Awesome, I'm glad you guys are getting value

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.630
just from us having this conversation

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.670
and I'm super stoked that Brent has ordered my book,

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.710
it's available on Amazon.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:32.910
So that's amazing, thanks so much.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.230
I have a question, is it out?

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:38.630
Because I thought it said like it comes out October 1st.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.030
So this is like a launch strategy, Alan.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.790
Basically, the Kindle comes out on October 1st

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.670
and I have released the paperback version on Amazon

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:54.070
at literally a price that just covers printing and hosting.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.990
I'm not making any money off of the book.

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:59.750
Basically, I released it in paperback cover

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:02.990
so that people who want to read it

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.390
and could leave me reviews could do that

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:08.030
and I've been working on it to gain reviews

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.830
before the Kindle launches

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:14.070
because that will help me get some love

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:17.670
from the Amazon algorithm when the Kindle launches.

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.790
The reviews are great, the book is great.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.430
I think I ordered a Kindle version,

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.390
but I'm gonna get, now that I know more,

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.670
now that I've read it, it's kind of one of those books

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:28.750
I wanna put some little tags in

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.030
and do some highlighting on.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:34.870
So I'm gonna order a paperback copy as well.

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.630
It is, now my worry is-

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.710
I, wait, wait, wait, no.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.550
Brent, Brent.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.390
No, no, no.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.710
Stop sharing your Amazon purchases.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:45.430
No, no, so I have this, right?

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:50.100
I just bought it, right, and it's Arriving Thursday.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.460
So are you telling me it's not Arriving Thursday?

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.980
No, it is, the paperback book, pay attention, Brent.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.660
I ordered hardcover.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.900
Yeah, it's coming in the mail.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.070
The Kindle book comes out later.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:00.910
Oh, all right.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.110
Yeah, you're not listening, you're too busy

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:05.990
getting your wallet case for your Samsung phone.

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.830
No, that was for my daughter's phone.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.510
Sure, sure, sure.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.310
Is there, so I had a lot of questions about the book

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.470
and I got to almost all of them.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.550
I think I have a good idea what's going on

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.190
and I learned so much about it just from diving in.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:20.270
Is there anything I should have asked

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:22.070
that I didn't about the book?

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.030
Yes, so there's one aspect

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.990
that I just briefly mentioned in the book

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.870
and it's this concept of

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:31.750
whenever you're updating your brain,

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:33.990
it's good to think about the software updates,

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:36.190
which is basically what we were covering here, right?

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.110
Going to therapy, having a coach,

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:42.870
this is phenomenal for updating the software of your brain.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:46.750
So I'm referring here to, to be just exactly clear

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:49.070
to your thoughts, to your beliefs,

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:51.990
to what it is that's kind of running through your head,

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.150
the mental legacy code.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:59.150
But there's also this second aspect, the hardware, right?

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.070
Because you could have the best software

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:04.950
and I'm sure you had experienced that in the past

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:07.110
where let's say you're trying to test

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:11.550
your newest Android app with the flashiest of features

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:14.190
on an older testing device.

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:15.830
And it just doesn't work, right?

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.910
Because the device does not have the hardware

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:22.150
that is able to support a new software.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:26.030
And so one thing that I'm really passionate to talk about

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:28.350
is this neurofeedback training that I did,

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:31.950
which is essentially a hardware update for your brain.

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:35.470
And it's something that is a cutting edge,

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:37.710
new thing in medicine,

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:41.710
doesn't require you to really take any pills

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:46.550
or medicine or plants, you're not consuming anything.

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.430
You're literally showing up to your sessions,

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:53.270
watching TV in your brain improves itself.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:58.860
And it's just phenomenal tune up of hardware of your brain.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.050
Wow.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.530
I have never heard of this and as you were talking,

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:06.850
I'm like, oh, Dagnah, no.

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:10.410
Don't tell me I have to lose weight or exercise.

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:11.250
Gross.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.050
I was reaching to tell me.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:18.810
Showing up every week and watching TV, yeah.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.930
My brain space is one of my better skills.

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:24.690
Boom, Brent is solid, perfect.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.460
Awesome.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.260
I was afraid it was gonna go to that my hardware

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.980
because I'm old, maybe too old to reprogram,

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.580
but I'm glad that's not it.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.140
Oh no, absolutely not.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.980
So we now know that our brains, thanks to neuroplasticity,

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.540
they change throughout our entire lifetime.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.420
So you could be 99 and your brain

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:47.980
could still improve itself.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:48.980
Yes, yes.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.100
At one point in my life,

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.060
I read a lot about neuroplasticity

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.820
and the brain's an amazing thing.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.100
So I am excited about this.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:59.580
I'm gonna post the link to the book.

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.020
I just bought a copy.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.620
Mine's coming on Monday because I'm a prime member, Brent.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.060
I'm a prime member as well.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.300
Your eyes work better than mine

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.700
and you can still read those stupid paperbacks.

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.660
I can't.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.380
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:24.420
Anyway, absolutely wonderful having you here.

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.230
I was excited, like one,

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.030
I went through three stages of excitement.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.110
One, just having you contact me to say,

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:34.470
hey, can I be on the podcast?

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:35.910
It's like, oh my God, you're so good.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.350
Yes.

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.310
Two, reading the book and going,

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.430
oh my God, this is good.

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.670
We need this.

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:44.310
Technology needs this.

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.310
And then even another level of excitement,

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:47.630
having you here, walking us through it,

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:51.230
getting more insight, absolutely amazing.

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:54.030
Thank you for spending some time with us today.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:57.350
Any last words?

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:58.630
It's been my pleasure.

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:02.150
And the reason I really wanted to contact you guys

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.030
and get on podcast, number one,

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:06.230
I remember how much fun we had in that

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:09.910
175th episode back in the day.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.990
It was a lot of fun, so I knew I wanted to do it again.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:15.230
And the second thing is, at the end of the day,

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:18.030
your brain isn't involved in every single thing

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.270
that you do, everything.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:23.350
So if you can improve your brain just a little bit,

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:25.550
everything else will improve too.

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:26.660
Yep.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.260
And those are the things I just have to say.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.100
I've been wanting to find a way to say it in,

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.940
but we're about to end.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.580
Dagnah, I love your energy and your passion on this topic.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:42.580
Like, right, it doesn't play out well in the podcast,

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:48.380
but Dagnah has been smiling this entire time.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.820
She loves this topic.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:55.670
And I gotta say, like, you find someone

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.390
who's passionate around it.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:00.550
If it helps, if it's something that you're interested in,

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:05.220
engage, these are the people you wanna interact with.

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.700
Thank you for coming on, Dagnah.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.540
It's been fantastic.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.820
Thank you so much for having me here.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.260
All right, that's been episode 200 and something.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.060
I'll figure it out later of the AAB testing podcast.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:15.900
Yeah.
