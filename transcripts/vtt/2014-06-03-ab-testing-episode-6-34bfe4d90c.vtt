WEBVTT

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.390
Hey, I'm Alan, and I'm here with Brent.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.910
And we're here for episode six of A.B.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.070
Testing as if you couldn't get enough, right?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.110
Absolutely.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.110
We're having a good time.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.910
And Brent, I don't know if you realize this,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.110
but I believe our listener list is approaching double digits.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.350
I was about to say the same thing.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.230
I have gotten all sorts of people, hey,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.470
I'm actively listening.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.190
I'm actively listening.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.310
That's really cool.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.190
It's not going to lull a friend of ours.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310
Mutual acquaintance this afternoon.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.670
He said, I listened to your podcast.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.310
I said, did you hear the one where I had to bleep Brent out?

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.470
He goes, oh, not yet.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.470
So if you're looking for that one, that's episode four.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.150
You know, I listened to that three or four times.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.110
And it wasn't until the fourth time

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.390
that I heard the beep, because I think I had kids or something

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.710
in the car, and it skipped right over that one.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.830
And then I was about to call you and go,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.350
what the heck was this?

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.870
And I'm like, oh, right.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.630
Right, right.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.510
So what you don't see is maybe someday we'll get all high tech

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.230
and you can get the video version.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.190
We'll do a vlog.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.190
Instead of vlog, a video blog, you

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.630
don't realize how much I taunt Brent just using

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.030
the power of my microphones or writing things on my coffee cup.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
Yes, things.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.510
So anyway, we're having a good time.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.990
And we're here to talk about a couple of things.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.590
And we have our Kanban list, our Lean Coffee List

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.630
on the board.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.270
And the first thing I wanted to talk about

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.030
was a little revelation I had.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.390
I've read a lot of books on Agile and flow and value

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.070
and things like that.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.350
And I had a conversation with a development manager last week.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.590
And I like him.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.390
I respect him a lot.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.950
He's great.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.430
But he pushes my buttons in a way

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.830
that makes me think about things.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.750
And so it's both good and bad in that.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.310
Yeah.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.390
Brent just gave me a look.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.590
I'm like, pushing buttons, but thinking about things.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.390
I had a conversation about trying

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.710
to figure out how we're going to track our work, or a better way.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.310
I was suggesting better ways to track our work

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.190
within our project tracking system.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.550
Now, I'm going to go ahead and explain the whole thing to you.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.590
I think it's fair to do.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.510
And you can give me how you would do this.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.750
So in Xbox, I ran sort of a virtual team

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.390
to do all our infrastructure and tools.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.070
We ended up with about 80 different people

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.110
contributing to the tools we use to test and systems

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.150
and reporting and things we used

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.190
for testing Xbox.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.590
And we had a special node.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.630
And we used TFS for project tracking.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.670
We had a node we called the test development kit,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.510
which kind of included sort of the engineering system

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.070
work that we did.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.350
And I suggested we should do that on this new team.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.150
I think it was a great way to track that work.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.350
One, to understand sort of the tacks the team is playing on.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.670
What are you writing that's not product code?

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.990
But two, just sort of track that thing.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.310
I like the idea.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.110
Not married to it.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.390
I like the idea.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.390
What they really wanted to do was keep the work,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.770
track that work within the node of the team that understood.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.490
So there's four nodes like teams A, B, C, and D.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.290
If someone on team A was doing some build system work,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.310
it would be tracked under team A's, even though it didn't map.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.150
So he's really insistent on mapping the project tracking

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.830
hierarchy to his team hierarchy.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.510
So he more than likely wants to map the work being

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.950
done by the person who's going to be on the end of his finger.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.870
And we talked about it.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.070
He goes, well, I can't do capacity planning.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.190
There's a nice factory turn frame,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.030
meaning he wanted to figure out with his whole team doing work.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.110
And you want to be able to track that person's work.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.910
And I realized walking away, I said, OK,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.630
get what you're trying to do.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.710
And I'll make this work.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.830
You have to choose your battles over time, right?

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.550
And I think you have to choose your battles over time.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.460
I may fight that one again.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.340
But I walked away thinking about.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.180
You're not being agile.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.900
You need to prioritize your battles.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.340
I do.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.700
And it's down the list a little bit.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.460
The one with you is above.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.580
Fair enough.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.580
So I was I walked away.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.780
Specializing generalists.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.610
I walked away reflecting on the conversation,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.050
thinking about, you know, what can I, you know,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.050
I've got to think about this.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.850
You know why?

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.650
And what I do, my technique a lot,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.690
is I think, well, what's motivating people

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.770
to make these decisions?

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.170
And he has a lot of experience and success

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.170
in doing things this way.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.530
And I like to prioritize my battles,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.610
but I'm trying to work with him.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.770
But anyway, walking away.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.610
I'm thinking about this.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.530
And I go, you know, the difference is

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.220
he is really concerned with tracking activity and people.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.740
And what I really look for in what

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.890
I'm using these tools for this is I want to see stuff

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.490
getting done.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.250
I care about the work and the value stream.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.330
I want to see stuff start to get ticked off.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.810
That's what excites me.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.690
I care.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.250
And again, I don't manage people.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.610
I lead projects, but I don't manage people.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.490
I can see why he wants to use that as a tool to manage.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.090
Because what he's used to.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.090
He wants to use it.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.050
What goal does it solve?

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.610
Look, I'm not arguing for him.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.010
I'm trying to make a decision.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.210
No, no.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.530
I'm asking you, what do you think

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.370
the goal is he's trying to solve?

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.330
It is his management tool.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.850
It's how he manages his team.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.570
So he mentioned that he wants to be able to do capacity

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.650
planning.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.590
So what he's trying to do is create a predictable model.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.910
He's trying to say, I think this will be

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.630
get done on September 15.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.270
Absolutely.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.210
He very much believes in predicting the future.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.850
OK.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.920
So he's the crystal ball manager.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.560
Again, there are battles to be fought.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.600
I'll worry about it.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.240
But anyway, regardless of we can talk all about how

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.760
I don't like the way he's doing it.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.080
I don't like the way he's doing it.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.880
I would never, ever work for him.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.720
But I have to work with him.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.160
So I think, but now I know his motivation.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.620
He's really concerned about tracking people.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.300
And I'm concerned about tracking just stuff getting done

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.220
and knowing what that work is in a sort of maintainable,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.260
discoverable way.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.500
Especially for things that span the team.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.140
We don't have a tools team, yet we

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.820
have people that need to add build configurations to VSO

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.460
or need to write some scripts for migrating a repository

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.300
or something.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.060
Those don't fall into any of our functional areas.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.540
But I want to track that work, because that work's important.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.700
I want to make sure we can discover what that is.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.340
Like right now, it's very difficult for me

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.580
to go see what is in our system that's

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.820
in sort of that engineering systems area.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.900
Or if I wanted to add something,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.700
I need to add a work item for somebody

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.100
to make sure that something in the system gets done.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.420
Where do I enter that?

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.610
There's no good answer for that now.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.450
So he wants predictability.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.730
You want stuff getting done.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.090
Yes.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.220
So I fall in a different direction.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.700
So when I look at this problem, so Alan's

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.980
messing with my microphone.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.540
Because he refuses to speak into it.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.060
But anyway, go on.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.020
So when I look at this problem, I generally

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.060
tend towards the flow side of the can.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.610
Reinitz and flow or flow in general?

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.740
Reinitz and flow.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.340
But when I mean this, I mean more the can-ban style,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.100
that throughput is more important than predictability.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.100
And that becomes important when you add the thing

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.100
that you mentioned at the beginning of this topic.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.140
So if you have throughput plus business value in a way

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.780
that you can generate dynamic backlogs,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.340
then predictability becomes dramatically less valuable.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.220
There's only one case where it becomes super valuable.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.420
And that's when there's dependencies in play.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.860
So this guy needs to hit something by June 1st

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.300
because he has another team waiting on that.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.500
And they can't begin their work until they

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.020
have that dependency in their hands.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.380
Yeah, I agree.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.940
I think we're largely agreement on this.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.290
The key thing is that our approach

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.730
to work item tracking, this DevNet Engine

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.730
API, are not just different.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.290
And maybe I made it sound like because I'm not

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.290
fighting with him that I'm acknowledging his is OK.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.970
It's fundamentally opposed.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.580
The other thing I see that's a problem with his model

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.900
is he's trying to predict his capacity

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.540
and not trying to improve it, not trying to make capacity

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.460
available.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.940
And I can tell you, if you look at Dan Fink's work

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.620
about motivation, there's a lot of this in there.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.740
But I am way more motivated by watching items get done,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.620
that value stream occur, than I am

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.580
by getting my estimates right.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.860
Alan and I, we did this sort of a psychotyping test a while ago.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.340
Oh, yeah.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.060
Strength finders.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.500
And one of the things that Alan has is he's an achiever,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.100
which is exactly what he keeps saying.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.500
He wants to get stuff done.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.180
Whereas I'm a restorative, which means I want stuff fixed.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.740
I like making broken things non-broken.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.340
So the only other thing I would add to that is great.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.320
You got it done.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.600
But the next follow up is how do we

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.240
get this type of work done faster next time?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.760
Yeah.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.480
And that's a big part of what I self-prescribe of what

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.800
I do on the team is I want to, using

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.160
a term from the lean startup, I

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.160
want to increase the efficiency and speed of our build,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.520
measure, learn loop.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.200
So you brought up value stream.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.720
Have you ever heard of the tool called a value stream map?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.240
No.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.640
Tell me about the value stream map.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.200
A value stream map, you can think of it

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.150
as a linear diagram where work goes through phases.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.150
And each of the phases are either a work phase

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.780
or a wait phase.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.020
So generally, the way these value stream maps are drawn is a,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.860
it's kind of like a, what's the square sign we've called?

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.500
Is that a called a square wave?

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.900
Square wave.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.740
Square wave.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.500
So it's kind of drawn like a square wave

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.300
where the top part of it is time spent working.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.580
And then it goes into delay.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.900
Maybe you're doing a handoff or you're

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.820
waiting for someone to get back from vacation

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.540
so they can pick it up.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.820
And that's in the valleys.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.580
And then it goes back up to work.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:55.740
And then what my team does is we do a flow based exercise.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.380
And any time a ticket exceeds our SLA,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.900
no matter what ticket we work on,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.900
once we start it, it has to be completed in two weeks.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.740
If it fails to get completed in two weeks,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.650
we're going to do a value stream map for that ticket.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.280
And we're going to look at what caused the delays in that

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.560
system and figure out how to work those delays out

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.300
of our process, what we should have done differently

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.160
and learned from it.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.880
What this enables us to do is not just

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.800
accept that the way stuff works

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.960
is the way it's going to continue to work,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.680
but constantly improve it.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.920
One of the fallacies around capacity.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.830
We are moving into a world where we have to move very fast.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.350
And move quickly in the right direction.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.350
Correct.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.550
Which is the business value part of the discussion

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.350
that we're having.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.350
That should be what defines the right direction.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.590
Sure.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.910
And we talked about all interruptions

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.470
and do a flashback to episode five.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.870
But we talked about the principles

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.350
established for our team.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.550
Not the entire team, but for our quality old world test team.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.870
Which are, we value people that achieve.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.070
They get a lot of work done.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.540
That work has business value.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.540
You work with others, but those things are all reflected

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.260
in how a big chunk of our team works.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:23.960
So I'm actually leading a reorg of how we do work

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.560
a certain way in our team.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.880
Have you heard of the term fundamentals or NFRs?

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.720
This is sort of the.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.160
Oh, non-functional requirements?

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.680
Yeah.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.960
So perf, stress, scalability, security, compliance.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.210
So my team has 20 of them.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.610
And the way they've been.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.570
I'll interrupt, because that's what we do here.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.180
How did you decide on 20?

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.540
I wasn't part of this process.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.460
Why not 19 or 21?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.060
20 is a good number.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.340
All right.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.580
19 would have been prime.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.660
I would have divide things by five with 20.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.580
Seven's prime.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.580
I would have picked seven.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.100
Yeah.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.540
Zero seems like a good number to me.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.500
Continue, Brett.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.000
All right.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.580
Anyway.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.680
So the way this work's been deployed

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.140
is it's sort of a matrix V team model.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.820
Where because there's so many of these fundamentals,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.020
there was a desire to sort of simplify it.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.820
And they all kind of involve deep knowledge

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.620
in that space.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.500
Like federal or regulatory compliance,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.380
you can't just say, hey, Dev, read this spec.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.460
You need to have someone who understands and can prioritize

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.180
and roll it out.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:49.900
The challenge is there was a bunch of owners that,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.940
so basically V teams upon V teams upon V teams

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.540
in order to make this thing successful.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.180
There was a divisional.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.420
You know how I feel about V teams, right?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.220
Yeah.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:02.780
Go on.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:08.100
And your feeling is going to be nothing but validated here.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.180
So long story short, all these V teams pushing requirements

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.180
down to the same individual developers who's

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.420
trying to get work done and just now has

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.260
got requirement overload.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.980
Massive stall in the system.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.460
So one of the things that I am doing is I'm saying, hey,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.180
we're never going to succeed with that because the dependency

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.500
matrix and the knowledge sharing that's implied

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.340
to make this successful is false.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.220
Like people just do not have the ability

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.180
to lightweight pick this up.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.860
And one of the things that they were trying to deploy is,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.020
well, we'll just file tasks and we'll file bugs

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.460
and they'll know what to do.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.900
But the person doing the work doesn't have the context

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.700
to understand the priority of this in comparison to everything

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.820
else that they're doing.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.220
And they don't have the goal.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.890
So it'd be things like, do 10 iterations of fuzzing?

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:07.140
Well, how do I know if that's right or not?

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.700
OK, I did 10.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.620
Is it good?

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.420
So now you added another delay in the system.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.980
Anyway, I'm working to take these things

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.620
and interleave them together.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.660
So what we're going to do is each of these things,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.580
their whole purpose in life is to reduce risk to our service.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.100
So not all categories reduce the same amount of risk

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.820
and certainly some category that's a low risk reducer.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.330
Maybe its first requirement is super high.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.850
So what we're going to do is come up

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.970
with a way to normalize off of risk reduction to the business

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.450
and stack order that whole list.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.240
And then we're going to carve off the top four of them,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.520
make it simple, and say, all right,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.240
everybody in the feature team, we as a whole team

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.880
are going to get these four done this next month, quarter,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.240
whatever it is.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.240
We're beginning this.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.760
But what we did is instead of trying

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.560
to push multiple timeline requirements

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.800
and trying to push multiple requirements in general down

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.160
to the poor guys, we said, hey, we

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.360
have a definition of business value.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.120
We've ordered this list by that business value.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.000
And now we're going to carve off capacity.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.840
So proactively, everyone will need

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.600
to fund what is necessary to get their guys to done

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.710
on these things.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.820
And that will be more important than feature development.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.980
Cool.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.820
I think there was a tieback I was going to do back

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.700
to value stream method.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.020
That's OK.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.100
But first, I'm going to talk about virtual teams.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.740
I'm sure your virtual teams are fantastic, your V teams.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.100
And I've seen a lot of really poorly run V teams

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.420
where they, I'll give you some examples.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.860
The V team contains about 30 people.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.580
And maybe one person is doing work.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.380
Everyone else is kind of listening in and showing up

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.620
to meetings and sending email during the meeting.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.580
Wait, let me finish.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.180
Often, or the V team will get something done.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.260
They'll keep meeting and not know what to do.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.100
They'll kind of twiddle their thumbs.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.140
It's stupid.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.640
It's stupid.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.420
But good V teams are indeed possible.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.740
And the technique I use, virtual teams, is.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.020
Wait, wait.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.060
You forgot one thing.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.940
OK, tell me.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.660
The other thing in terms of your first example of V teams

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.270
that fail, where everyone's doing laptops,

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.430
there are a few people who contribute.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.110
And their value at is to tell the one guy who's

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.070
doing all the work.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.970
Oh, no, no, we can't do it that way.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.330
So I don't think I ever blogged about this.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.330
I have some notes on it.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.970
But I like the world, what I call it,

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.330
the world of Warcraft approach to virtual teams.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.250
And Brent's nodding.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.790
I think I must have told him the story before.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.530
You have.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.770
I think probably one of our listeners

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.450
has played World of Warcraft.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.850
And people are addicted to this game.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.210
You get to the end game.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.650
And you go on these big raids or these quests

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.370
with random people.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.410
Those are virtual teams.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.050
So some of the rules from World of Warcraft

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.370
we want to follow here are you form the team

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.340
to accomplish a specific task.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.420
Like go get the chest of bablumba.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.420
Plus two.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.200
And you put a diverse team together

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.960
that's capable of accomplishing that task.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.080
So you don't go in there with a bunch of warriors

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.880
or all magicians.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.380
You get a diversified team.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.340
So you can actually get the thing done.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.380
Everybody's involved.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.250
Everyone has a role.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.330
When the task is done, the team shares the rewards.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.130
That can be just accolades or whatever.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.450
They share just the accomplishment

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.370
of getting it done, whatever.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.330
Share the rewards.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.250
And then they either disband because they're done

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.330
or decide to take out another project.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.410
And you play World of Warcraft.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.350
You don't go on a raid that takes three months to finish.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.690
They're short term.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.510
First thing you figure out is what are we going to get done?

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.230
Is that feasible in some short amount of time?

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.070
And you get that done.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.430
And after that, you decide if you want to take on

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.950
the next thing or disband.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:02.830
Then you're done.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.670
You go away.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.490
It's a small group.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.330
Everyone's involved.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.570
Everyone has a role.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.870
And that form, I think, is a wonderful version

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.130
of how to run a V Team.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.230
Not these things where everybody kind of gets together

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.590
and hangs on.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.350
And everybody just wants to be informed

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.190
and not do any work.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.070
Drives me nuts.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.910
The, I've actually come to learn it as a different thing.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.350
So the word working group is now the thing

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.550
that I'm allergic to.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.630
In V Teams, I'm OK with.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.520
Because working groups, by definition, they never end.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.180
And I'm like, no.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.880
So I will not be a part of any working group.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.120
We need a whole new term.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.360
Because often V Team and working group,

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.440
at least at Microsoft, are sort of interchanged.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.280
And we need a new term for a group that is, by definition,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.920
short-termed.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.840
So when I run a V Team, it's very similar.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.840
The very first day, I get everyone in the room.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.340
And I said, we're not leaving this room

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.440
until we've done two things.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.680
We understand what are the goals that we needed to deliver

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.640
in order to abandon this V Team.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.580
So I'm starting off with, we are abandoning this V Team,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.740
but we have stuff we need to do.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.900
And then the second thing is, what are the success metrics

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.220
that we will use to determine whether or not

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.100
we are in the weeds on track?

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.220
Or I guess some in-between state.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.740
All right.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.220
Yeah, I think it's often lost.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.460
V Team is like, let's get together

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.500
and talk about code coverage.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.260
And they're like, what do you want to do with it?

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:41.780
I don't know.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.980
Let's just talk about it.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.160
Does somebody want to talk first?

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.080
Yes.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.760
Let's cover code.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.280
Great.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.240
Goal done.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.160
Stop the V Team.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.960
No, so one of the things that's very exciting for me right now

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.560
is that I'm seeing a sign at our company

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.800
that the next important shift in the change

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.360
is beginning to occur.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.960
So Alan and I have been spending a lot of time

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.080
around helping to lead change.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:16.310
And it's been primarily around two important states, I guess.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.430
One is, the way I would phrase it

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.550
is sort of on-premises thinking and why

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:26.350
we needed a waterfall or a long span,

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.590
interactive process moving to more of a service

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.630
or an agile model.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.550
And another thing that I know I've blogged about,

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.110
I don't know that we talked about it.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.310
Did we ever talk about QoS and QOE here?

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.270
I don't think so.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.510
Oh.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.470
QoS and QOE.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:48.480
These stand for quality of service.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.480
And quality of experience.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.720
Now, what they basically are is the evaluation.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.800
QoS is the evaluation of the system behavior.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.040
So these are things like latency and performance and crashes

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.640
and reliability, all of those type of things.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.600
How well does the system work and is it doing the right

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.720
thing?

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.400
And then QOE is sort of an analysis of customer behavior.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.000
And I know in my last blog, or not my last one,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:24.360
but a couple of blogs ago, I was talking around how and why

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.360
people should help people to migrate from a QoS model.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.360
We're focusing on, well, we've got

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.570
to keep the reliability of the service up and running

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.490
and begin to shift more towards a QOE world.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.730
And in a nutshell, the reason why I share this

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.530
is in a services world, a service that is 100%

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.490
reliable that no one uses.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.650
What's your feeling on this?

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:53.850
It's worthless.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.090
Right.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.250
It's absolutely, it's actually worse than worthless.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.970
Yeah, because you invested money in it.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.450
Because you invested money in it.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.810
Right.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.170
And one of the discussions that I

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:12.130
have quite often with leadership in the last several years

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.970
is trying to help them understand that.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:20.290
And what I'm now seeing signs is the company shifting more

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.410
towards the reverse.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.690
So people will generally shift from QoS

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.890
and then slowly migrate to QOE.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.850
It makes sense in what people were used to

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.090
were sort of on premises.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.090
Well, I think that works with sort of the risk model of I

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.090
want to make sure my reliability is there.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.930
And then I can roll it out to more people.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.090
And they can, them will worry about their experience.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.770
Right, but the problem with that, the problem with that model.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:47.610
I know the problem.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.930
It's trying to apply logic.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.170
It's this service equivalent of, but we

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.120
got our value proposition right.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.640
So in the on-prem world, some PM three years ago

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.400
for the product that we just shipped today,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.960
some PM three years ago, put his finger up in the air

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.960
and said, I think the wind's blowing this way.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.760
We went all in on that.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.800
It's the same version.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.760
If you ship a service, you go with QoS first.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.240
You're basically saying the same thing.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.200
We know to be true that the value customers get out

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.520
of our product.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.040
Is that it doesn't crash and that's performance.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.360
Right, that's exactly it.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.400
It is notepad.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.840
We put notepad on the web.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.240
Whereas webpad.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.120
So whereas what I'm very excited about

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.370
is seeing the beginning of a ground

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.410
swell where people realize that the startup mentality,

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.930
MVP doesn't mean a beta.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.210
MVP means no.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.050
We are literally shipping the minimum product

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.730
that we need to answer this important question.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.690
Are we going in the right direction?

00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:59.330
Right.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.930
And if we are, then we'll stabilize that.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:06.330
Yeah, that's such a, it's so fundamentally logical

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.930
that I can't believe that it's taken us as long to figure it

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.210
out.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.770
It's this prevailing belief that people

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.970
got to hold on to their own world with white knuckles.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:21.010
I am now aware of several big high level leaders

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.570
throughout the company that their response

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.570
to sort of their underlings but still senior people in test,

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.290
for example, test guys, but what about all the bugs

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.250
and but what's happening now is that the discussion is not

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.330
happening anymore.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.850
That was what I was, oh, well, let's work it out

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:39.850
and make everyone happy.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.130
No, what's happening now is those leaders are like,

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.490
you know what, I don't care.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.610
We're going this way.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.330
Deal with it.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:51.380
If you don't like it, find another position to which I

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.450
applaud.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.570
OK.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.410
All right.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.210
I like that.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.650
Anything else on that?

00:25:58.650 --> 00:25:59.730
No, very happy.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.330
Happy, happy, happy, happy.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:01.970
All right.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.130
We're going to do a little bit of a shorter podcast today

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.370
because I have to go to a baseball game.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.250
He gets to go to a baseball game.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:08.930
It's my kids.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.600
It's the little league playoffs.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.240
Pretty exciting.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.120
But one quick announcement.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.560
I got some big news, Brent.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.400
So we don't have a mail bug today.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.880
So maybe you should do like the mail bag thing for announcement.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.680
Like, announcement.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.840
That one will work.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.320
All right.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.960
Thanks, Brent, for covering that for me.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.120
Yep.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.930
There is an award at Microsoft called the MSAA, Microsoft

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:36.890
Cheebed Award.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.440
And I received one about nine years ago.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.920
And what this award is.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.040
Well, a very belated congratulations.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.360
And so for nine years, I've been,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.800
when am I going to use this?

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.320
When you redeem the award?

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.160
And I fill out a little paperwork and had my boss and his boss,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.200
our VP, sign it.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.440
And what that does is gives me two months off paid.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.200
Nice.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.560
So combining a little vacation with that.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:09.270
And that means that from July 1st to Labor Day,

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.210
I'm out of here.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.370
So where are we going to be doing the podcast for?

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.530
I don't know what to do there.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.690
We'll figure something out.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.690
Maybe tell you what, you record some stuff, send it to me.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.690
I'll record some stuff.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.330
And I'll merge them together and post them

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.330
from the south of France.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.730
I will not be doing that because you're very clever with that.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.810
And I want to make it clear what I actually said.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:35.370
You'll hear Brent say, I am a weird man.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:39.370
Yeah, I am a pretty girl.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.570
Say the word dresses.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:41.070
No.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.260
So we'll take you something else.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.020
None.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.000
It's not working in the south of France.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.680
Spending seven weeks in Provence and followed by a week in Japan

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.880
visiting some friends of ours there.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.200
And then I don't think by the time I get home,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.910
I will have gone all the way around the world.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.150
Does Skype do recording?

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.270
We'll figure it out.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.710
We'll figure something out.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.190
We may take a break for a while.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.630
Sorry.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.470
Or we'll do something.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.350
Yeah.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.350
Oh, you know what else?

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.160
Another big enough that's coming up.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.800
World Cup Soccer.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800
Yeah, when's that start?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.720
June 12.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.760
How do you not know this?

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.480
Ah, watch real football.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.200
No.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.000
So my training in soccer is something that I'm nascent in.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.320
And I've been asking Alan, and he knows this for years,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.440
to actually ramp me up on this.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.600
All right, we should have maybe I won't use it by name,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.280
but that soccer conversation sometime.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.040
You probably want to write it for sure.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.600
Yeah, that's a whole full podcast.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.180
We should start my training somewhere around June 12th,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.580
involving a beer or two.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.900
All right, I think discussions have devolved to beer, which

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.340
is always a good place to go.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.340
Yep.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.660
They don't serve beer at Little League Games,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.740
but I'll deal with it.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.780
They have water.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.940
Yeah, I'll pretend.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.060
All right, thanks, everybody.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.660
I'm Alan.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.180
I'm Brent.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.180
And we'll see you later.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:05.700
Bye.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.140
Oh, did I see you?
