00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.250
Welcome to episode 199 of the A.B. testing podcast.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.250
I'm Alan.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.950
I'm Brent.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.640
And we have no theme music.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.160
Why are we doing this like like like brains in a funeral?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.330
Dude dude, hey, since the beginning of time, I have set the tone for the A.B. testing

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.650
podcast in my intros.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.570
And Brent, the beginning of time, and we have something going on.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.610
There's a reason Brent got confused on my intro.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.410
You know, honestly, we press record and I have no idea what's going to happen.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.930
I have a little bit of an idea what's going to happen today.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.370
We have something a little special planned and we don't know how it's going to turn out.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.700
This is going to be structured winging it, I think.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.700
Ready to turn down.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.900
Structured winging, there's another term for that.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.180
Structured chaos, chaotic, I don't know.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.170
Here's what's going to happen.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.690
It has been 10 years probably since we recorded the very first episode of A.B. testing.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.890
It came out on April 3rd.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.480
We are having a huge party.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.600
Join our Slack group, one of the three.slack.com.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.280
You can find the link on moderntesting.org or my latest five for Friday post.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.280
Probably put it on LinkedIn.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.960
We want to get a bunch of people there.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.640
Basically we're doing a webinar.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.920
Wednesday night we're calling it a podcast.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.760
It's going to be a party and it's going to be fun.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.910
But we're going to do a little back in time, just like Huey Lewis in the news.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.590
And tonight, Brent, do you have anything to say about this?

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.590
Do you want to tell us what we're doing?

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.060
It was your idea.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.440
Neither Alan nor I.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.040
When was the last time you listened to this?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.160
Ten years ago.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.160
You listened to it?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.760
And remember, the audience doesn't know what this is, Brent.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.080
Did you mean to put each other's thoughts there?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.080
No, I didn't.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.840
But you pretty much choked.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.650
No, I didn't.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.290
I was leaving mystery.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.530
Oh, I get it.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:18.800
Yeah, actually, I think actually we recorded it probably two days ago, ten years ago.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440
Something like that.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.080
Ten years and two days ago, I think most humans would say that.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.140
Yeah, we thought it might be fun.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.220
We had Alex has Alex.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.650
Alex is my oldest son.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.650
Yes. And he gets irritated when I call him Alan.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.760
Alan hasn't listened to it in ten years.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.920
I probably haven't listened to it in eight or nine.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.780
We thought it'd be fun to go back and and on the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.610
penultimate of the one hundred.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.850
We thought it would be fun to go back and listen to episode number one and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.890
potentially mock ourselves insensibly.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.130
Oh, definitely mock ourselves, except for how youthful I sound.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.330
But let's let's get on to that.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.290
So without further ado, and I'm actually one thing, I have listened to the first

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.010
15 seconds of this and I will tell you that the intro had a mix a little high

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.810
for the first few dozen episodes.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.330
So you might want to turn shit down right now just a little.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.650
Here we go.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.040
There's no voiceover.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.080
Just to fade to nothing.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.360
And then check out.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.440
I'm Alan. I'm here with Brent. Brent, say hi.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.960
Hi, guys. Hey, we are going to be crazy and try and do a podcast because we're

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.840
I have no I was going to say we're really stupid.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.320
But what are we, Brent? Why are we doing a podcast?

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.560
Well, you know, Alan, we're kind of learning.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.720
Holy crap.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.200
I can barely hear you over you.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.560
Yeah. All right.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.600
I just said let's just go on a little bit.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.920
But yeah, kind of learning and figuring that out.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.240
What we're what we're experimenting on is whether or not this is a medium

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.400
that will will help ourselves grow as as communicators and help the test

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.800
community around us to learn and adapt and change with these changes that are

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.280
coming on. Was that serious?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.640
I was just thinking we just want to listen to ourselves talk for a while

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.470
because well, now the funny thing is, brief pause, we've done both.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.430
We have listened to ourselves talk for one hundred ninety episodes since then.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.430
Except for the one you for the one you weren't on.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.750
And then we also have talked about the changes we're seeing.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.990
You continue to see.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.590
Right. And the other one I said is improve as communicators.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.550
Maybe. Yeah, let's go on.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.630
There is definitely a nontrivial bit of that, Alan.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.230
Well, all right, we're going to give it a shot.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.270
Brett and I have a history of having animated conversations at Microsoft.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.390
We thought we'd try and capture some of those and share those with the world

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.230
for as many as two, maybe four people.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.070
That's our goal. What's our I don't know if we have guys yet.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.070
I think if we can get three, the architect group that we.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.470
It's three.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.670
This is the funny stuff.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.230
We have three listeners. So you guys to know me, I'm Alan Page.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.670
I've contributed to a few books of software testing,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.270
try and stay active in the community for just about 20 years.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.750
And we want to talk about yourself for a minute.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.430
I am Brent Jensen.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.670
I've been at Microsoft for the last 20 years.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.830
In the last, gosh, five years, I've followed Alan's lead

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.150
and been an active blogger.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.670
I'm not quite as attached to to the community as Alan is,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.550
but I'm learning from the master.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.430
I like to do it. You're in trouble.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.110
I like the joke that I currently get tens of views on my blog every week.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.590
But it's OK.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.830
The tens that I get are are an important ones to me.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.110
All right. Number one, it is absolutely weird for me to listen to Microsoft Alan.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.870
Like you've been gone for so long.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.350
I'm like, whoa.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.750
And and as an aside, I still even though I don't even remember

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.030
when I stopped blogging, but I still get tens of views every week.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.750
Nice, nice longevity, longevity.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.850
Let's continue.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.810
Some topics on the whiteboard you can't see.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.130
We're going to kind of look at those and put them straight from the whiteboard

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.010
and do this every so often and kind of see what happens.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.130
So how should we start this, Brent?

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.690
Well, so just just just to carry on from that,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.290
one of the things that Alan and I have been have been really starting

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.530
to pick up throughout Microsoft, it's this concept of lean coffee.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.530
And that's how we'll start off these podcasts.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.530
So we'll generate a list.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.690
We may or may not share all of them with you.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.010
And we'll just go through the top in terms of what we think is the high

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.530
priority that's of interest.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.570
New blog title, Alan and Brent Lean Coffee Live.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.890
No, I'm the name of the body.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.330
I'm waiting for you now.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.910
I thought it was A.B. testing.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.110
Yeah, I can't hear you when the other things going.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.270
No, it's fine.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.950
Yeah, Lean Coffee Live.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.910
Yeah, the A.B. testing in a way.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.990
You know, I when's the last time you've been doing lean coffee?

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.990
I did a virtual lean coffee like last month.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.350
Really? Oh, I haven't been doing my work.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.870
I hadn't even heard the term for like five years, six years.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.270
Well, it's because you're stuck inside the bubble of Microsoft.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.790
People already know everything.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.550
The rest of us are trying to learn stuff.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.550
Yeah, I know, Brent.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.270
Test meetups are the cool new term.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.170
Yeah, you know, so on that theme, I'm.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.250
Maybe both of our our listeners can vote, except it'll be you and I.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.170
Yeah, the thing about A.B.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:28.970
testing, I like it because it's it's it's about quality, but it contains the word test.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.640
What's wrong with the word test, Brent?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.840
Well, we'll talk about that a bit later.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.760
Let me say in terms of credibility.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.120
Always the best partner that I have done most of my career at Microsoft.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.160
The title that I've worn is test manager for the majority of that career.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.800
I've been in test for I've held just about every position you can have

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.760
with the acceptance of director and my partner in crime here has held that title.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.920
Yeah, I was a director with five director.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.360
No, six director parts.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.240
Director's director.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.400
But I don't even like managing people.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.280
The the wow number one.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.240
So I should probably two things to comment on.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.040
One is we definitely had a lot of microphone noise back then.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.200
I sound like I just finished running up 50 flights of stay.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.280
I hear you're youthful and excited.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.720
You've been like the cynicism hasn't washed over you yet.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.600
Yeah, but I'm wheezing for some reason.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.800
I think you weren't you doing like the thing at the pro club

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.000
where they beat the crap out of you, that 30.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.280
So the 20 20, I might have been dead.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.640
But yeah, even then I would have recovered.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.080
But so to be clear, like what I've clarified later was I did not want

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.360
to manage people at Microsoft because I hated we've been talking.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.200
We just talked about the systems that we made managers go into last episode.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.040
Yeah, directly.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.520
So anyway, let's let's plug away.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.430
I don't even this is fun because I do not remember.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.910
Like, of course, I don't remember this conversation 10 years ago.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.270
So I don't know what I'm going to say.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:20.400
For one change that has occurred in my life was when I gave up the title of test

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.960
and I shifted over to Bing.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.960
Bing is a search and anything that I could give the test community today

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.780
as a gift would be the experience I had when I went to Bing.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:45.740
The the number one thing that I learned is the difference between testing and quality.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.300
When I when I head over to Bing, I took on a dev roll and

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.800
but I still wore wore my test hat.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.960
And one of the most important things I learned very quickly in Bing

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:09.590
is how little value bugs are when you're shipping every day in Bing.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.150
Everything changes every single day.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.070
You have every layer of the stack.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.910
Devs changing.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.230
You have the UI changing.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.430
Bing has a seasonality aspect to it in which what's important changes.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.510
So news today is not going to be the same news next week.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:41.950
And filing a bug just doesn't end up being helpful to to moving the quality forward.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.710
But so I was going to ask a very leading and stupid question.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.910
Isn't it Chester's jobs to find bugs?

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.530
It is. Over done.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.090
I don't really think that.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.730
That's a neat thing.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.970
Yeah, the OK, to be clear, to be clear, that was over.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.090
Doug, that was you.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.730
We that was 2014.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.250
Alan jumping in with the fake overdub there.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:15.490
So actually, I actually I figured out one of the things about my my voice

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:22.250
because I could hear myself back in those days doing presentations.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.650
If I were in front of the presentations from the people,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:31.930
I'd get instant dry mouth and I'm like, oh, that's what's happening.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.010
In the old days, we sat in a conference room together with microphones

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.360
and a little mixer and did our thing.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.360
Yeah, I wasn't nervous about you.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.760
I was nervous about the amorphous, you know, three people.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.520
Two to four. Yeah, two to four people.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.600
We hadn't yet said three, but two to four people. Right.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.280
It's amazing how well we nailed it.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.710
We're right in the right of that range.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.270
When you're in a test manager role, one of the key things that you often

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.190
have to do is you got to do things like schedule test passes.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.310
Right. And one of the things that I learned very quickly is is wow,

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:11.030
if I were a test manager on this team, it would simply not work.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.000
We have a a several million test cases that are possible.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.400
And if we were to do a test pass in the amount of time

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.520
that it would be valuable, we would need about a million testers

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.380
to execute the test pass in about five minutes, because all of that would change.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.820
Once that test pass was done, we would have some useful information

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.340
and it would be invalid 10 minutes from now.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.420
But you have a million testers.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.060
That's that's so that leads into the next aspect.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.340
Oh, goddamn, Alan, still in my thunder.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.140
I do it all the time.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.540
But what's funny there is you say as a test manager, I just scheduled test passes.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.100
There's a little bit of a gasp for me.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.100
And that gasp has only gotten louder in the last 10 years from people

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:10.100
talking about scheduling test passes or or filling out test case forms, et cetera.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.500
It's like, oh, God, yes.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.820
Just just grow.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.580
Come to the come to the present.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.740
Come to the new world.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.900
Yeah, no kidding. I.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.220
The the gasp is right on.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.640
I'm like, oh, yeah.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.680
Oh, yeah, I still remember doing that.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.120
God, why we press faster?

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.900
All right. I just let's let's continue after me stealing your thunder.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.260
This is kind of that.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.460
You know, it's really interesting is one more meta comment here is

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.510
I didn't realize we started we let off episode one talking about this feature

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.630
that 10 years later, many people still don't see.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.550
We've gotten better at talking about it.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.940
So we've anyway, interesting.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.580
I didn't realize I thought we just talked about B.S. stuff.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.120
We let right into the stuff that became the principles within,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.640
I don't know, 50 episodes or so.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.480
Yeah, Brent's cat has joined the podcast.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.950
She's upset. I'm not petting her.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.830
Yeah. All right. Let's go.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.270
This doesn't help that I know where Brent's going.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.790
I know what he's thinking.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.430
But there's an intersection.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.150
There's a theme here that we'll probably end up talking about a lot, which is that

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.070
how teams approach software engineering and the roles of all disciplines,

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.470
especially the roles formerly known as testers are changing quite a bit.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.830
Yeah, that's true. And and one of the one of the themes

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.070
that both Alan and I very much agree with is that it's not only changing,

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:50.360
but it's changing significantly for the better that that

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.080
my my point of view on this is

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.000
I think of James Whitaker's

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.840
Whitaker's from years ago.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.440
There he is again where he said all of that testing is getting in the way of quality.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.080
And you mentioned James Whitaker.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.600
There's a whole class of listeners just turned off the podcast.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.840
But we like it. Go on.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.960
So so so we went from two.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.400
They give him shit for 10 years straight.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.920
I don't think James ever listen.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.560
There was a dance at the end. So stay tuned.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.320
Coming back. And it's good thing that this is a maybe my job here

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.320
is just knock Brent off his turn of thought the entire time.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.840
Yeah, I've done that for 200 episodes now.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.560
It's amusing for Alan, but I don't know that this is good audio material.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.360
Yes, it is.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.520
It turns out.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.320
It's a limitation that I get to within the first couple of months

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.840
to the test managers in Bing where I communicated.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.840
Wow. You guys own is magical.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.790
We had 300 million test cases being executed every day.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.380
This is something as in my prior role of test managers, I could never do.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.120
In addition to that, they were exactly the test cases

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.720
that needed to be executed that day.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.680
When you when you're sitting on top of millions of test cases,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.080
one of the challenges is you don't have the muscle to understand

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.760
which ones you don't need to execute.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.790
You as a test manager know you are wasting teams time and business value

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.070
because you don't have the ability to know which of these test cases have

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:35.290
have no value to execute in this in this in this Bing model.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.250
You do. It was fantastic.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.210
One of the one of the things I want to be clear on, though, a test case

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.890
in my in my way of thinking is an input

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:54.130
being applied to some sort of program, an output observed in a judgment being made.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.810
And this was happening.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.010
Three hundred million of these things were happening every single day.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.770
The one of the biggest difference, though, is it was being done by our customer.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.260
And the problem we had.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.020
Hold on, Brad.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.140
Did you make the customers test your software?

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.130
All the time.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.130
Sorry, I was mocking people on the Internet

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.330
don't understand the difference between customer doing your testing

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.880
and getting or not to take data from the way your customers

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.120
don't understand the difference between testing and evaluating quality.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.100
Are you talking about checking and testing?

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.180
I'm not even going to never mind. Never mind.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.610
I'm just going to hit play.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.920
And is on that last judgment call.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.760
We didn't have all the muscle we really needed to really understand

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.360
what call they were making.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.590
What was the judgment?

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.230
And as we move into more and more of a quality focus

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:58.550
and away from a testing focus, that's where I personally see us

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.510
gaining a lot, a lot of muscle as not only in the industry, but in

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.950
particularly in our company.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.510
Cool. We're going to explore that quite a bit more as we

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.710
venture down this role of recording us, giving each other crap on the

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.470
on the Internet.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.230
So that's enough of me babbling for now, Alan.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.230
What have you been up to lately?

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.390
Oh, what was I?

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.080
What? So what was I up to?

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.080
Well, you're about to say, but

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.760
didn't we do this before Microsoft?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.840
Like when did Microsoft kill test?

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.840
Oh, this is way before then.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.880
But I think now did we was I still working on Xbox?

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.880
I think I was doing the Stupid Science Project, the Android apps

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.480
on Windows Phone, which we didn't have testers on that team.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.840
I don't think I was still on Xbox, but I could have been.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.250
No, no, this is 2014.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.690
So I think by 2014, I was in Power BI.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.920
OK, I'd have to look.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.600
I think I was on the Stupid Science Project.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.040
Yeah, because I hadn't gone to teams yet.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.320
No, I was on the Stupid Science Project

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.600
because I think Xbox One had shipped.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.840
Oh, hold on. Hold on somewhere.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.040
It was right around the transition of me going from Xbox to Science Project.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.680
But maybe we should just shut up and I can press play.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.680
And maybe I'll say something.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.720
You will probably tell you. Yeah.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.080
Let's check in with younger me and see what I was up to.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.920
God, we're done.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.880
Some people may know I after Xbox One shipped,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.080
I decided to follow my manager because he's a great manager.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.920
Science Project doesn't listen to the science project.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.680
Move over to this small team sort of incubation project, which is under the.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.560
Incubation. I work in the Windows org now, which is a

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.240
brings its own set of interesting human interactions and challenges.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.240
Oh, oh, God, that was me so nicely

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.800
saying that Windows was filled with a bunch of assholes.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.800
Yeah, you were in Sinofsky's org, weren't you?

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.600
No, Sinofsky was. Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.640
Post Sinofsky Sinofsky had been booted.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.330
This was the frat boys.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.170
Uh, who was in charge back then?

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.610
But I say the frat boys, all of his directs for the frat boys.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.970
I forgotten their names.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.570
Michael Fortin, Chris, somebody.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:37.030
It was like it was like a boys club of it.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.150
Yeah, I did not like the people I liked my team, my team.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.990
Oh, no, I'm going to tell a quick story here and I'm going to leave.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.190
But I remember this team was made up of a handful of us from Xbox.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.870
Really cool people.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:54.160
I loved working with them and some people that have worked on Windows Phone.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.320
And we were making this thing.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.680
And there was a dev manager on that team.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.440
God, if you could ever hear my eyes roll like once a frickin day, he would say,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.680
we'd be talking about how to fix something, how to engineer something,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.960
how to architect something.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.440
And when he would lead a sentence by saying, well, on Windows Phone, we'd just shut him out.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.880
So no, no, that means we don't do that.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.480
Whatever you do on Windows Phone, let's do the opposite.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.830
The exact opposite, please.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.270
All right. I'm the way it.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.210
Yeah.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.890
And what we did on Ken was.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.560
There's a reason Brett does not bring up Ken often on the podcast.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.760
We have talked about it.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.880
I don't know what episode. Use your A.I. and go find it.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.640
No, I only I mean, I was the anyway. Anyway, it's.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.400
I'll leave it at that for now.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.000
I was very early on.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.800
It was all secrets, some windows.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.080
And if you are inside or outside of Microsoft,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.640
you've ever heard of the way Microsoft works, hearing the word windows,

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.440
making big shifts is either shocking or you don't believe it.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.000
Or you think by a big shift, meaning, you know, we're going to do nothing.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.440
Change the startup screen.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.650
Yeah, we'll change the startup.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.840
That's funny.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.080
So we're changing a lot of the way we do engineering.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.960
Windows is going to try and actually make software like I put it

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.360
like the rest of the world does are, you know, our developers,

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.480
many who probably have never written a unit test in their life.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.800
We're going to write unit tests, functional tests, integration tests.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.800
I don't know if they ever did one team because it's just damn more efficient

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.520
for the author of the code to write those tests.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.400
Holy crap.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.840
I was saying this before Accelerate came out and proved that with data.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.400
I didn't realize I go back 10 years to say it is just more efficient.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.160
Actually, what I say at the time was it's more efficient for developers

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.600
to write the unit tests.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.200
I had I don't think I had come around to discovery.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.680
There's a lot of me coaching.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.640
This is actually the first team I did test coaching on.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.440
But coming around to it's more efficient for developers

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.600
to write all of the automation.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.120
But I I guess I thought I was much dumber 10 years ago that I am now.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.800
But I'm really just full of the same hot air with different words around it.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.280
We've kind of been saying the same thing.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.920
And by the way, John Devon and Julie Larson Green, John Devon, who actually,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.160
by the way, John Devon lives like two blocks from me.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.000
OK, I'm just sorry.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.940
Sorry, I guess. Yeah.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.180
Yeah. The.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.580
Actually, I liked John.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.970
His direct reports were just a bunch of jerks.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:41.370
All right, go on.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.970
John was a nice enough guy.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.010
His his ideas were idiotic.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.000
OK, I'm going to push the button.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.600
Now, you know, it was John that did the director of test thing, right?

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.000
No, that was so much.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.760
No, you're right.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.120
John, that was John.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.160
So many tests architect.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.000
I was on the team where he tried it out.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.200
Yeah. Anyway, I think it was.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.840
It was. I don't want I don't want to flash back too much to Microsoft land,

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.920
even though that's just where we're.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.320
No, I'm too because I'm so excited about this because I'm just like,

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.240
what's that? It's only been 10 years.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.280
But the world is so different now.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.760
Let's let's listen on and see if that's true.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.800
We want to take advantage of some of the things we've learned

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.400
from people like Brent and others who have been in services for a while

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.880
and apply some of those concepts to testing desktop software, doing things

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.560
like, you know, we're going to we're going to flight, we're going to iterate.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.240
We're going to do all kinds of great things.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.040
I won't go into the details because I'm sure someone will get mad

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.720
that the world now knows Windows is going to make software really well.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.240
Didn't work.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.640
But we had this is a big shift for a lot of people.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.720
So we did a quality day, a one day event

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.800
where we talked about why we're making the changes, what it means

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.480
and what it means for the different disciplines

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.280
and how your role kind of changes and lots of examples of that work.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.320
Early on, I worked on the committee for this and early on, we decided that,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.120
well, the original plan was like seven one hour talks.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.000
And whenever I go to every time I go to a conference

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.720
and I start sitting in track session after track session, I go, man,

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:30.030
if I ever host a conference, it's all it's going to be all 30 minute or less talks

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.590
because, you know, hardly anybody has, you know,

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.030
as anything interesting to say for a whole hour.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.590
And there's also the aspect that that Alan is riddled with ADD.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.060
Mm hmm. Hey, Mr.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.420
Pot. Yeah.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:52.460
So I don't know if project my spread a squirrel anyway.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.560
So we had just trying to throw you out.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.880
You included a flurry of talks.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.880
We had an opening keynote that was 45 minutes.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.720
And then even vice presidents were limited to,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.000
you know, anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.520
We kind of shifted times through the day.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.200
And a couple of amazing things happened.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.760
One was we actually held, you know, more than a thousand people,

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.840
close to two thousand people interested for a full day.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.040
And two is, you know, the talks went pretty well.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.920
People felt like they got something out of it.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.640
And that's, you know, I remember nothing

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.200
been involved in other conferences at Microsoft.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.640
And this one, I think, was it went really well.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.800
It was it was some talks were 10 minutes.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.200
A lot were 15, a lot were 20.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.280
I don't think I went to the sort of told the story pretty well.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.760
There's our goal, you know, coming out of that was or going into that was

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.760
let's have fewer questions, let's generate, let's answer more questions

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.880
than we generate and getting rid of ambiguity is always a great way

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.320
to help lead change in an organization.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.640
So it went pretty well. I was pretty happy with it.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640
So optimistic.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.840
I think it's still a long way to go and a lot to learn.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.560
But I think people have an idea of kind of what it means.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.560
Brent's raising his hand. Excuse me, Brent.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.400
Now, before we get to Brent, you know, we talk about the same things,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.480
but I've matured over the last 10 years, actually is in handling

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.720
this organizational change and dealing with ambiguity and and just having more influence.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:33.560
Yeah, yeah. You in the last 10 years, you scaled and affected change.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.800
Like, like I think about what you learned when you went over to unity.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:45.800
You were quite a high level when you left Microsoft.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.260
And yet I still don't think you would have had the impact.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.080
No, and I think, you know, I I had to leave.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.320
I didn't have to leave, but I had believed to do what I did grow where I wanted to grow.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.360
So it's been great.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.000
All right. I can't wait to hear what you had your hand up.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.920
And what do you think?

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.800
10 years ago, Brent said, let's find out.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.310
Burt.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.920
Wow. First one, we're going to go that way.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.920
That's an inside joke. We'll talk about that later.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:25.920
So you said something that I think is super interesting to me anyway.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.920
So you said that it went really well.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.920
Did you happen to talk with a bunch of people?

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.920
I'm curious what were sort of the top five themes that came out of that,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.920
that really resonated with folks.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.100
The first thing I heard, the thing I heard foremost was the format worked.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.100
And that's I was involved in that change.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.100
I was happy to hear that.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.100
As far as people taking away things, there is, you know, at Microsoft,

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.100
we have this three discipline system.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.100
We have program management.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.100
We have software development and software test,

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.100
which we call quality in Windows now, but it's the same thing.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.100
Trying to shift the mindset by the title.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.100
I completely forgot about that.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.100
Do you remember that?

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.100
So we had the quality and fundamentals group and we.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.100
Yeah.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.100
It was a lot of, it was.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.450
Yeah.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.450
And we need to control.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.450
Far too much. But yeah, it was spin control.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.450
They still had a quality team.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.450
Those folks are all gone now, but they focused on data.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.450
And that's what a lot of folks in Windows like.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.450
That's when Steve, former guest a few times on the show.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.450
Right.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.450
He's really deep into the data science world.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.450
As far as I know, I don't know if he was still there anymore,

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.450
but he cut a lot of a lot of folks from test went that direction.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.450
Some went to Deb, some left.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.450
But yeah, I forgot about the quality group.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.450
The three pronged.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.570
In hindsight, I realized now I didn't know at the time how

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.570
wrong the whole approach was because I was in the middle of it.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.570
And as much as you know, I paid more attention to what happened

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.570
outside of Microsoft than a lot of people at Microsoft.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.570
But it wasn't until I left and kind of saw more that I really

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.570
began to see a bigger picture.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:07.640
Yeah.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.640
Brent just stabbed himself.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640
So, uh,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.640
10 years later, you stabbed himself.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640
That's funny.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.640
There was a good one of the things I love to do when I'm like getting

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.640
a new team put together is get the discipline leadership together.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.640
I talk about what their team does, what their expectations are for

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.640
other people.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.640
And this was like a big forum version of that.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.640
In talking through what the roles did, we had we had a lot of

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.640
opportunity for everyone in the room, all engineering disciplines

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.640
to understand what each other was responsible for and what they

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.640
were, what new things they were responsible for.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.640
So everybody's kind of in it together.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.640
That was another big theme that came out.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.640
And people loved.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.700
I'll do the third theme.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.700
People love this.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.700
We had a ton of examples of where data driven quality has

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.700
worked and where, you know, making not just the business

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.700
intelligence part of understanding how users using the software,

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.700
but building statistical models on our analysis and using that to

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.700
make predictions on how customers have used software and examples

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.700
of that, like I think the scales shed people's eyes and they

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.700
thought, Hey, I think I get how this can work, which if you

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.700
work in an org like windows is a huge, huge thing.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.700
It's a, I'll just say it's a team deeply rooted in history.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.240
I was far too optimistic, but they are, they have a far

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.240
far far far too optimistic.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.240
It didn't, I thought at the time I thought, man, yeah, it's going to be

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240
so great.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.240
And it's still a moving ship.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.240
Were you optimistic or were you just at a phase where like, okay,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.340
first episode, it's hard to tell.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.340
It's listening to younger me.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.340
It sounds like I believed it, but I could have just been trying to

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.340
tell a good story.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.340
I feel like you were a good story.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.340
I could have just been trying to tell a good story.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.340
I feel like you're, you're being careful.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.340
Uh, right.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.340
It's the first thing.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.340
Okay.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.440
We're already talking about Microsoft.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440
I don't know either.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.440
I've been talking a lot about Microsoft over the years.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.440
So yeah, I don't know.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.440
We both have, but I'm so employed there.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.440
So I'm still very careful, but yeah, I think it was our

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.660
first episode where we were like extra careful.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.660
I don't know.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.660
Nobody.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.660
And I'm sure you've heard nothing since, since I left,

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.660
but we never got caught.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.660
I don't think a single person who cared at Microsoft,

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.660
listen to our podcast.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.660
I've got one reach out from HR.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.430
Oh, uh, I don't know,

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.430
like seven years ago and they just wanted to confirm that,

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.430
that it was me.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.430
Nothing else came out of it.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.430
I guess.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.430
Interesting.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.430
I guess I showed up and yeah.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.880
Anyway,

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.880
it showed up in my permanent record somehow.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.880
All right.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.880
Brett.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.880
Yeah.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.880
The fine tradition.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.040
Um,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.040
of producing really great code at a,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.040
at a really great cadence.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.040
The,

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.040
the one thing I might say to our competitors is this,

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.290
despite what you think about windows,

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.290
our people,

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:19.290
we have a large number of people and they are really good at execution.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.290
Once this culture shifts,

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.290
they're going to be really good at this new culture.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.290
Or careful.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:27.290
Absolutely.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.290
Correct.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:29.290
Um,

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.290
we have good executor.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.290
And when,

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:35.190
when the hammer did finally fall,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.190
right?

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.190
It,

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.190
it was either,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.190
I look back at it now and there's,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.190
there was really two people,

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.120
two kinds of people,

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:51.470
the people who started executing and the white knuckle folks who were like,

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:52.470
no,

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.470
same with any organizational change though, right?

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:55.470
That's true.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:56.470
Yeah.

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:57.470
Same back then.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.470
Yeah.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.530
It is.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.530
We, um,

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.530
anyway,

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.530
I don't want to get up on the Microsoft raw,

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.530
raw band,

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.530
but we have a ton of work to do and,

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.530
um,

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.530
sometimes it's frustrating,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.530
but,

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.530
uh,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:09.530
it's,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.530
um,

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.530
yeah,

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.530
it's interesting to be part of this change right now.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.080
I,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080
I,

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.080
I haven't seen a more exciting time in my career,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080
uh,

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080
than the time we were,

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.080
we're in right now.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.080
I think that I wonder if that's true across the industry.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080
You know,

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.080
I think we're talking about some of this stuff and we're going to wrap up in a

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.080
minute here.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080
For those of you that are extremely boring,

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.080
I remember talking about some of this stuff just about a year ago about,

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080
you know,

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.080
some of the changes we're making on my,

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.080
I think it was,

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.080
I think I was on Xbox then.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.080
Sorry.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080
I had to think for a second.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.080
And it's been a blur.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.080
So just so you guys know,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.080
Alan spent five years last year in Xbox.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.080
Yes,

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080
I did.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.080
It's all a blur.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.080
Um,

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.080
I should've got an extra five,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.080
five year service award just for the my two years in Xbox.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.080
Yeah.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.080
Um,

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.620
wait, so where were you?

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620
But I described some of the things,

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.620
you know,

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.620
right.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.620
This is where,

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.620
where were you then then?

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.620
During this talk.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.620
Oh no, that's right.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.620
You were,

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.620
you were on science fair project.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.620
We just had this conversation.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.620
Yeah.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.620
Yeah.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.620
Yeah.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.620
All right.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.620
Let's go.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.620
We need to go.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.620
It's cutting edge that I remember talking to someone outside of

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.620
Microsoft and the quote was,

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.620
uh,

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.620
this would all be revolutionary if it weren't already happening.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.620
And,

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.620
uh,

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.620
I remember that.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.620
I remember that going,

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.620
oh,

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.620
you and I talk about like maybe we're on the edge of the bubble,

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.620
but we're not.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.620
There's always people ahead of us.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.620
And I can't remember who said that to me,

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.620
but that quote has stuck with me for a long,

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.620
long time.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.620
Right.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.620
I mean,

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.620
it isn't for,

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.640
uh,

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.640
we did around,

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.640
it wouldn't be for another three and a half years before we would do

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.640
modern testing principles.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.640
Could have been.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.640
We had to talk about still end up.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.640
We vetted it out for a long time.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.640
And again,

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640
we're just at bay.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640
Anyway,

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640
anyway,

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.640
love that comment.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.640
I feel like,

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
I feel like people keep telling me that,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.640
but I've kept it in episode one.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
It's weird.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640
It right.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.640
Reminds me a bit of,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.640
um,

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.160
a comment.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.280
What was one of the books?

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.690
Oh,

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.200
exploratory testing.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.200
I was,

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.200
I have,

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.620
um,

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.620
I have a book there on my shelf.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.620
They're all my sign books,

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.620
including yours and all of them I have from Whitaker.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.620
That Whitaker's exploring her testing book.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.620
Yes.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.620
And I,

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.620
the best part of that book is the forward.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.750
The forward is like the most masterful writing in there.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:42.960
Um,

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.960
yes.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.960
I do know who wrote the forward.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.960
I am just moving on.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.960
Um,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.960
fair enough.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960
Fair enough.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.960
Um,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.960
uh,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.160
I remember.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.160
So James and I would do monthly lunches,

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.160
uh,

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.160
back then.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.160
And I remember going to lunch with him and I'm like,

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.160
James,

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.240
this book is,

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:10.240
is just like a span on how to break software.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.080
He's like,

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.080
he's looked at me and he just smiles.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.080
He's like,

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.100
yeah.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.100
I mean,

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.100
if they're not learning in 10 years,

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.100
like I can just bring it all back and act like it's new.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.100
I'm like,

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.520
okay.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520
All right.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520
Let's,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.520
let's check out the riveting conclusion of episode one.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.120
I'm glad to get into the world here and I,

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.120
you know, I'm excited.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.120
It's a fun time to be here.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.120
The positive thing for our company in this,

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.120
in this front is that it is already happening.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.120
There's a lots of examples.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120
Um,

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120
we're well motivated,

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.120
uh,

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120
because our,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.120
we were so Microsoft or succeeding with this type of model where we're

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.120
still struggling.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.120
That's a lot of words.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.120
They were getting our butts kicked.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.120
Yeah.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.120
Yes.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.560
All right.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.560
I think that's enough for today.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.560
We have lots more to talk about,

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.560
but we'll get to it next time.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.560
Our lean coffee list is not exhausted.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.560
Uh,

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.560
I'm Alan.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560
Thanks for listening.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.560
And I'm Brent and have a fantastic week.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:24.950
In my dreams.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:26.950
So,

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.950
uh,

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:29.950
okay.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:30.950
A couple of metacommas,

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:31.950
we can call it good.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:32.950
So one,

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.950
I sound young and didn't realize I was so optimistic.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.950
And I was going to try not to edit this one too much,

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.950
but I have to go edit out your typing now.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.950
So,

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:41.950
so thanks a lot.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:42.950
You bet.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:43.950
Um,

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.950
yeah, overall.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:45.950
Uh,

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.270
okay.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.270
Horrible,

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.270
but it was fun to listen to.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:54.270
I was just thinking about something because so Sinovski left in 2012.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.400
Okay.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.400
And we recorded this in April 2014.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.400
And bomber left in 2014.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.750
And I'm like, okay, where was,

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.750
I'm trying to see the exact month.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.750
Were we still under the,

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.970
the Yoka bomber when we recorded that?

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.320
Because a lot of the things,

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.320
a lot of the things I think that like,

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:30.280
it took him forever to realize that we needed to shift to agile.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.720
Like, um,

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.720
you remember how he did the road show amongst all the high level.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.720
Yeah.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.720
Yep.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.720
And I remember, um,

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.790
the last several of them, he was like, we gotta get more agile.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.790
We gotta get, I'm like,

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.790
and he was trying to do like the developer, developer, developer thing,

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:48.790
but with agile,

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.790
but it was very clear.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.790
He did not understand what it meant.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.790
It, right.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:54.790
He was,

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:57.790
he grew into the position well,

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.240
but you know,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.240
one of the reasons I left it wasn't changing fast enough for me,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.240
but I think he, it took him,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240
you know,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.240
a year or more of being in that role to kind of figure out what he really

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.240
wanted to do.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.240
And then, um, you know, uh,

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.240
just, just, just didn't get there for me.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.240
But yeah, I remember the time it's so weird.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.240
It seemed, and some,

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.590
it feels like a couple of years ago and 20 years ago,

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.590
both at once.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:28.830
Right.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:31.240
Cause I can't do date math.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.240
All right. Any other comments from you?

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.240
August, August 2014.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.970
So, so, so yeah, we, we were, um,

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:43.970
yeah, we were like, yeah,

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:47.970
these other companies are stealing our candy and that was 100% because

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.970
we, we hadn't executed a shift.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.040
Yeah.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.390
Yeah.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.390
Yeah.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.390
Things had to get a little worse for the guy.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:56.390
And it's interesting.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:01.390
Look, I, you and I both have spent the better part of the last 10

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:06.390
years working in the service space and yet still,

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.480
still many of the things we say today, we say, we said on that episode.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.120
Yeah.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.340
The cloud may catch on.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:21.340
People may use the cloud and still, still go in that direction.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.400
Right.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.400
It, it, it, I keep dreaming.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400
It'll be a thing one day.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.400
That's why I keep investing in it.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.590
All right.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.590
Well, let's call that good.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.590
I am.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:34.590
That would help the listeners.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.590
You had fun there and please come hang out with us Wednesday night.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.590
Links to be found on the internet somewhere.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.590
I'll help you find them Thursday morning, depending on the time.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.590
You can listen to the recording Thursday morning.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:47.590
Yeah.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.590
Another big apology to all of our listeners in Europe.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.590
The best time for Brent and I to record was our evening,

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:58.590
which is middle of the night for our friends across the Atlantic.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.590
So it'll be ready for you when you get up.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:05.590
Cause I plan on just fixing voice levels and releasing that one right

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.590
after we're done.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.590
So it'll be out.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:13.650
Should I show you how to post it to your podcast apps within 20 or 30

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:15.650
minutes after the recording is done.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.650
Oh, you're going straight to straight.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.650
I'm not going to edit anything.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:22.650
I'm going to leave it all there.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.650
Hopefully it'll have to put an explicit tag on it.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.650
But you never know.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.650
I might be drinking some champagne.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.650
We'll see what happens.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:30.650
Yeah.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:31.650
All right, everybody.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:32.650
This was episode one.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.650
Ninety nine.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.650
Sorry.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:36.650
Yeah.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:37.650
One ninety nine one.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:38.650
But it was one with one ninety nine.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:39.650
All right.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.650
I'm out.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:41.650
Yeah.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:42.650
I'm Brent.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.650
I'll see you later.
