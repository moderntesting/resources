00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.350
Hey everybody, I'm Alan and Brent won't get his butt in his seat.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.500
Oh, oh, wait, Brent's actually going to join us for this podcast.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.940
Hey, Brent, how's it going?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.260
And I'm Brent.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.700
Yeah, what the hell? It's episode 23. Right.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.380
It is.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.100
Hey, don't forget to talk in the microphone.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.020
Twenty three. Michael Jordan's number, right?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
Yeah, it's fine. I can. God dang, you're a doofus.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.830
How about you talk in the microphone?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.830
And hello, here's the microphone.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.270
And then you'll be bigger and I will level it later.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.750
Because I always have to because you seem to want to wander to and fro from the microphone,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.270
even though you're just sitting in a chair.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.950
All right. Episode 23. Michael Jordan's number.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.310
More importantly, David Beckham's number at Real Madrid.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.670
I don't remember what number he played with at Galaxy, but I always remember.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.390
Beckham is 23 also.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.710
I'm sure there are some other ones.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.790
Twenty three. Can you believe 23?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.140
And not once have I punched you in the face.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:14.300
So one of the consequences that we now have, as as Alan has mentioned a couple of episodes ago,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.740
that we changed the time of the day.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.420
And so now it's now I think the second or third time.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.020
But you walk in and you're not prepared.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.130
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130
We're not going to hash this. We have this shut up.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.250
You know, I'll be on time when we start to win in my building.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.890
You know what?

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.050
We're going to have a discussion about that in just a minute.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.770
Live. No, well, not live.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.450
You know what it means.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.770
We probably will.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.610
We're going to get there.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.650
So you didn't I say to the board to do one thing, which was to write the order up there.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.730
And yet I see no numbers next to our list.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.770
So I'm going to make it up.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.330
I am becoming the product owner and I'm going to take over.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.210
And if it's wrong, doesn't matter.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.970
I'm in control top to bottom.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.020
No, because number one on the list has to go third because it's not as exciting.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.380
I don't think. OK.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.460
All right. I'm product owner.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.060
You shut up.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.780
Hey, guess what tomorrow or today?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.380
If if I actually get this done when I want to and get this podcast out on Friday,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.540
June 5th, it will be exactly 20 years since my very first day at Microsoft.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.900
Congratulations.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.340
Twenty. How did this happen?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.420
Oh, my God. Twenty years.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.740
What do you mean? How did this happen?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.340
Twenty awesome.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.620
Twenty is down roller coaster years.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.300
Some people could have those easy lives.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.370
You have been a part of making history

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.650
and helping to change the company.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.650
You know what? And you've experienced the roller coaster.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650
Shut up. Great. Shut up.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.810
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.370
I never thought I would be here this long.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.610
And guess what else?

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.590
You don't have to get going to be here this long.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.670
This is no. This is where.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.950
Brit, this is where we blow it because we already have a list

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.830
of what we're going to talk about.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.790
So asking questions like guess what else?

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.110
Probably not the best way.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.910
Wait, wait. Let me try.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.660
Oh, Alan.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.260
I would like you to start wearing pants to the podcast recordings.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.740
That's not part of the.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.060
All right. We don't really have a contract.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.580
So I guess it's anything goes.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.980
Hey, 20 years and guess what?

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.740
After thinking about it for a while and keeping my eyes open,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.720
I have a new job.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.080
I'll share a little bit at Microsoft.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.040
I I found this job, which is that I've told Brent about it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.640
a little bit so he can't act too interested.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.120
But it's I think uniquely suited to me, which is

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.000
and some things we talked about, which is really cool.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.320
So I want to dive into that a little bit.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.920
There's a Brent and I have talked about the efficiencies

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.480
that come with you to find engineering,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.640
how you need generalizing specialists,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.880
specializing generalists, especially people who really get quality.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.720
I shouldn't butter myself up so much.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.920
I found a team making a V1 product around collaboration.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.960
Tools. I'll just I'll stop there.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.440
They have about 100 developers, unified engineering team,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.880
and they want someone to come in and be the quality expert.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.600
And no, this does not mean I'm writing all other tests for them.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.640
Yeah. Because then I would just shoot myself.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.640
I mean, I actually enjoyed seeing people attempt that.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.400
Not going to happen. Not going to happen.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.600
Because the problem is, is that the people who want you to do it outnumber you.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.280
No, it's everything from, you know,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.360
Atlassian has this I read a couple of blog posts from Atlassian

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.960
a few years ago where they called QA quality assistance

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.600
and talked about the sort of role we've talked about where, you know,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.280
coaching and mentoring developers are running good unit tests,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.600
good code hygiene, et cetera.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.600
I'm really big and anal into code craftsmanship.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.960
And I believe in broken window theory and keeping everything kind of clean.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.840
And I don't know broken window theory.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.680
Yeah, yeah, sure. You do.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.240
Broken window theory.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.280
If there's like an apartment building, this is

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.080
I first read about it in the pragmatic program, but I'm sure it's been around for a long time.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.960
In fact, actually, I first read about it in the context of software development

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.360
and the pragmatic programmer. Great freaking book.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.240
But the idea is that if there's a building like in a rundown part

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.520
of the neighborhood and one of the windows gets broken out,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.720
if it gets fixed right away, it's going to stay nicer longer.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.880
If you don't fix it, people are going to start breaking other windows.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.800
And the metaphor for code is if it's like, why should I make this part?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960
Why should I clean this up?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.200
It's already kind of grody over here.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.560
So the idea is in code and I'm really big into make everything right.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.120
One of the things I noticed is like, hey, you know what?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.240
We're not very consistent.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.600
We're not the new team, which I haven't quite joined yet.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.640
But I spent some time over there isn't really consistent on

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.430
comments on code chickens.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.750
I thought, let's fix it up right away because I don't want to see,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.950
you know, I want to know it's I want to be able to know

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.830
what's going on by browsing history.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.270
And I think what happened there is a classic example that you mean

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.070
specifically, you mean not people commenting the code,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.190
but actually people commenting the check.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.470
Yes. Yeah.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.350
I actually get value from browsing source history

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.670
and I get I get context for what's going on there.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.470
And that's not accurate.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.110
I don't want to dive into the whole why I like it and what it's good for.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.230
But the point is, I think it's gotten to a stage.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.070
This is a quick observation after two days on the team that

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.710
because nobody else does it, no need for me to do it.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.110
And these things apply everywhere. Anyway, you've already started

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.190
kind of ish.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.270
So my official start date because of Microsoft

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.590
and the weird things with our compensation model is in order for me

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.950
to get paid by my old team for the last year of work I did.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.990
I can't I can't officially move until June 15th

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.410
with one of the model locks.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.690
So don't give me that word.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.250
Look, I got I got it all checked down.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.490
They charge for check this.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.850
OK, yes. I'm I'm spending probably half to three quarters of my time

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.130
between now and then doing what we should do all the time

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.850
at Microsoft when we change jobs, ramping down on one

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.730
while ramping up on the other. Yep.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.970
So anyway, I'm going to back out of made a point.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.490
Part of the job is just kind of being big on code quality

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.890
and code correctness.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.450
I do believe that quality and care are two sides of the same coin.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.050
So I'm going to help people put more care into code and check ins

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.290
and unit tests, et cetera, and do all the right things at the same time.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.530
Also, I'm going to look big picture at

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.810
when there are people doing perf work, but I'm going to make sure

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.970
are we doing the right perf work?

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.930
Are we doing the right reliability work?

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.730
I'll have some vendors doing some exploratory testing.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.570
I've got a chance to teach some E.T. for a while.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.170
How are you?

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.210
I've been there a day and a half.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.290
Don't ask anything too specific.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.930
I'm making part of this up.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.770
You're you're you're talking about a straight

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.370
strategy that you're going in with.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.370
When you say doing the right work, what's your primary pivot for that?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.240
It's the much of the discussion you talk about is that you you're

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.930
going in as a test centric or quality.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.250
Now, quality centric.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.810
Definitely more than the correctness sort of thing.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.330
I think code correctness is because I have a passion around that

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.250
and I can for a team that hasn't done unit tests before.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.690
Very well, very much unit testing.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.810
And again, somebody I in my intro mail to the team, I mentioned this podcast

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.050
in hopes of picking up two more listeners.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.170
The point is, is there's things that can do better

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.130
and I can help them do better in that area.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.770
I don't think my new manager that's even on his radar of what he wants me to do,

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.210
but I'll do it because I think it's important and I think it will help.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.410
I believe I'll draw I'll draw this with my hands for now, which is useless

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.410
for people out in the audience.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.770
But I've been thinking of this sort of pyramid of software quality

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.690
where this long base at the bottom, I'm going to do it without with my hands

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.250
to see if Brent can understand it without the visuals.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.130
So the measure at the base of this triangle or pyramid

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.610
is sort of the functional correctness, which is where a lot of testing

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.570
when I started 20 years ago, for example, where I spent a lot of my time

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.570
at the base of this triangle up a level from there, you have

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.730
maybe the illities belong there, the non-functional, you know,

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.370
whatever you want to call it, NFI, performance, reliability, security,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.690
making sure you do the right stuff.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.210
But you can actually run a lot of perf tests and run a lot of

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.690
reliability tests, et cetera, and do a lot of work there

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.450
without actually making software that's useful and has value for the customer.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.490
Right. So that that top of that pyramid or the top of that triangle

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.610
is the things I'll probably spend the most of my time, which is in that work,

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.330
I'll look at is this useful?

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.930
Is it solving the right problems?

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.290
Even if the perf tests are passing, is perceived performance

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.370
for the customer good exploratory testing will fit in here.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.010
I'll definitely ask people doing that.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:43.410
And this is where also data analysis as well, both from a qualitative

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.050
and a quantitative aspect will come into play.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.850
Are you officially stating that you are entering into the data analyst scheme?

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.050
I am officially stating that looking at because this is a web app

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.050
that will eventually be used by large numbers of people, that

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.690
knowing how to do effective data analysis and helping the team adapt

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.250
to the insights from that data will be part of my job.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.050
And freaking testing.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.130
So anyway, I'm pretty excited that the breadth of the role was much better

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.570
for me than some of the more in-depth things I've been doing recently.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.130
I don't think I'll say this in my blog, but I'll put it in the podcast.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.490
But I have said before that working on my two years in Xbox

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.050
was the best five years of my career.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.450
Fantastic time. Oh, my God, that I work hard.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.410
My two years in part of the operating systems group at Microsoft

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.510
were Project Astoria, cool project buried under windows somehow.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.150
But my two years in the operating systems group have probably been

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.550
the longest five years of my career.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.390
The direct manager I work for the team I work with.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.510
Absolutely fantastic.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.950
As we build concentric circles out from there, it's like just not.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.750
It doesn't align with my passions, what I'm interested in,

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.550
the way I like to work.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.950
But I didn't want to just go to a job to get out.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.790
I wanted to find something that really like that was the right job for me.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.590
So I took a long time to kind of what I call passively look

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.030
and last two things and.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.820
And if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and tell a quick story how I got this job.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.940
Yeah, I was passively.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.900
I just won a Saturday. It was a Saturday.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.700
But I'm just going to look at the internal job site

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.940
and take a look and see what's around.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.860
And and on a whim, I had emailed Brent like a week before I said, hey,

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.900
I'm thinking of maybe being a manager.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.460
He was like, I'd be a fine manager.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.660
I'm thinking, oh, my God, I want to be.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.860
So anyway, I thought I'd look at manager jobs and I was flipping through.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.820
It's like, no, no, hell no.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.740
And then I see this one which sounds like the hell no.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.900
I don't. OK, it was probably one of my current group.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.460
I don't know. Yeah, current division.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.060
But I saw one. It was interesting.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.220
It was it was a lot about quality.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.580
And it's hard.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.980
One thing about Microsoft now, if I shift to unified engineering,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.900
a lot of teams, it's difficult to figure out who has which teams,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.700
which job descriptions I could kind of leverage my passion for quality

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.900
and experience into. But anyway, this one, I read it.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.140
And it's not like they want someone with a lot of quality experience.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.460
And I didn't see much about actually managing a team in there.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.380
I thought, well, this is interesting.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.420
I'm not sure what they really want. It was manager.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.340
Yes, under manager jobs.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.180
And it was a Saturday.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.780
I sent some mail. I got a reply that day.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.260
Not that people should be working on Saturdays all the time.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.180
It just happened to.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.380
We set up an appointment for the following Thursday.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.760
So several days from then in.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.880
It turns out they wanted he put it as a test manager job

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.880
because he had an experience with the really good test managers of the past

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.720
or that kind of big picture thinking about quality, et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.320
But he didn't mention much about the team in there

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.200
because he didn't want a testing.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.600
He wanted a quality guy who didn't want didn't care about having a big team.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.440
I thought, well, hell, that sounds like me.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.560
So I talked to

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.240
one of their dev managers on Friday.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.350
That was in the three day weekend came up.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.710
And then the following Tuesday, I talked to three more people

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.950
and I had an offer.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.820
Wednesday or Thursday.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.220
I recently we talked about this couple of several podcasts ago about my job change.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.500
And we spent a lot of time talking about my experience of the new interview process.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.980
Do you have a similar?

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.980
Yeah, this is really interesting because I've given a lot of feedback to our team on.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.060
Let's get out of old school interviews.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.300
And and it was great.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.580
The way the interview loop went, it wasn't a loop set up by HR.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.580
The guidance I got from my upcoming new manager was set up one on ones with these people.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.180
And so I did.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.580
I took care of setting up some time on their schedules.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.500
And and I met with everybody and they asked.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.140
This is weird.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:08.380
They asked good questions that I felt like both allowed them to understand what I brought

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.980
to the table that would help their team and help me learn about their team.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.500
And there wasn't a lot of like, why are you asking me how many golf balls could fit in

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.060
a bus or to reverse a linked list or whatever?

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.820
And whole coverage.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:26.000
We actually we actually had conversations about crap that was relevant.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.940
It was refreshing as hell.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.820
You've gone through several other type of experiences.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.460
Were those more old school?

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.820
So one of the things that you guys don't know is that this is something Alan and I

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.260
have been talking about for, I don't know, months.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.120
It feels like right.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.880
Alan has been as he was was doing he.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.590
Alan's a capitalist.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.270
Yeah, he is that good or bad?

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.230
It's good. All right. Great.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.830
I'm yeah, I'll let it be was passively.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.990
He's always interested in exploring a better offer.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.990
And one pattern that he's talked about here on the podcast before

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.750
is he kind of has a preference to sort of change things up

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.590
for himself over a couple of years.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.910
It's certainly come to that.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.590
I've changed even when I've changed jobs in the same group, it's been about

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.270
every two years and he used to tease me about it.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.350
I said, no, it's not like that.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.390
And it's not like I it's weird.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.830
It's not like I change the jobs on purpose.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.510
Like two years I'm getting a new job,

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.070
but I'm always looking for the new challenge.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.110
And it seems like I find the next cool thing about every two years.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.470
I actually think it's just how the world runs now.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.550
It could be. You know, I spent just over four years

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.430
in engineering excellence, but I changed jobs partway through.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.870
I did two years as an IC, then two years as the director over there.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.670
And then I spent 18 months in in link, a little shorter on my on my spin.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.710
Two years, two years in Xbox.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.390
And then I just followed my manager over to Project Astoria.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.790
Two years there.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.750
And I don't know, maybe two years on this team.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.820
I don't know.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.180
I when I went to my last team, I was fairly certain

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.780
I was going to be there five years plus.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.220
But I only did just over two years.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.820
Stuff happens. So anyway, lots more will come up from that.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.100
There's I'm excited about all the sort of the stuff that's in my core.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.500
I get to start doing some new things.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.940
I get to start trying.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.910
I think it'll be a good time.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.910
Yeah, I'm looking forward to.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.710
Oh, hopefully I'll be part of your communication chain.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.030
You start getting into the.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.670
Yeah, you'll have to be. You'll have to be.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.710
And let me plant a seed.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.470
We're not going to hash this out now and bore that and and further bore our

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.430
listeners. But one thing about this job, it's in downtown Bellevue.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.830
So I'm moving about five miles away from branch.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.430
So we got to figure out where and when to get a decent recording in and maybe,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.510
you know, and how to actually meet.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.550
I am not going to Bellevue.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.230
Hell, you're not at 5 p.m.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.990
That's true. I'm just making that super good.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.430
The all right.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:59.710
So I spent time working in Bellevue and and no, I understand completely.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.040
So maybe I was going to say, I was going to say working in

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.000
in in the Bellevue branch of the Bellevue area for the Microsoft stuff.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.080
Best work location I have ever done.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.640
And if nothing else, I am indeed

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.680
incredibly envious of you for just that.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.480
I loved working in Bellevue that much.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.220
But going from Redmond to Bellevue, not cool, not cool.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.460
We'll go back to mornings.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.900
Maybe we'll switch and do like one in.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.860
We'll figure something out.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.060
But you and I can figure that out.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.140
It's closer to your home now, isn't it?

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.460
Yeah, a little bit with traffic.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.860
It's about the same commute.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.500
We'll figure it out over time.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.300
Anyway, yeah. All right. Be fun.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.780
20th floor. Oh, 20th. Yeah, that's cool.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.100
Yeah, good view up there.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.540
Should be great. All right.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.980
Oh, I wrote A.B. testing up there, but for that to tell you what it was about.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.100
We're changing subjects, by the way.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.180
OK, we're moving on.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.100
Is this A.B. testing the blog or is that a slash?

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.740
That's I put a slash there.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.660
Wow. Because guess what?

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.660
Now we're getting contextual.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.740
Do you remember the time?

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.780
Double entendre.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.340
Do you remember that one time where I said I went in bank camp?

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.060
No, sorry. It's a movie quote

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.380
where I said I wasn't going to do as many conferences for a while.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.840
Yes. Well, I got a call. OK.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.560
I got an email. Nobody nobody gets calls anymore.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.120
You get an email or a text.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.160
But inviting like a speaker dropped out of the Better Software Conference next week.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.600
And I'm going to go down and give a talk on A.B. testing. Are you?

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.480
OK, I think.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.560
And are you yet an expert on this topic?

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.320
Oh, actually, I would say I definitely know more than the layperson.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.560
And I thought I haven't finished, you know, it seems like it'll be

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.800
some good research to help prep you.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.600
No, no, no. I'm actually I feel pretty good about what I have.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.960
I'm giving a talk about inside the mind of the 21st century customer at Star Canada.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.120
And I stole some of that.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.960
But it kind of turns out, I think I kind of want to give half the talk on

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.840
houses for an A.B. testing talk.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.520
I should give the talk twice. No, this is not A.B.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.040
This is like a then I don't know how you describe this.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.760
But I think I'm going to give half the talk on how awesome A.B.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.280
testing is and the insights you can get, how much you can learn from it.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.760
And the second half of the talk on how A.B.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.160
testing is impossible to get right.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.080
How you should never do it and trust the results.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.530
And then the A.B. test, maybe we'll see what their takeaway is.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.570
How long do you have an hour?

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:40.210
It's an hour. Yeah, that's it'll be interesting to see if people get it.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.250
What you're doing.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.930
I'm not sure I'm going to do it that way yet, but there is some emphasis.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.250
And I can't tell I have the abstract from the person who was originally scheduled.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.250
So I can't really tell what they were going to do.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.250
But I think it's really important when you talk about A.B.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.250
testing to go into statistical significance and figure out

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.050
what your sample size has to be to make sure you can really understand

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.850
and believe and talk about confidence levels and and Z scores, et cetera,

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.130
to be able to figure that stuff out. Wow.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.410
I know shit, man.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.770
I'm impressed. Hold up the Z score.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.970
Boom. I don't have a memorize.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.150
I have to use the little chart thingy.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.820
Do you know P stat? I don't P stat.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.060
OK, because that needs to be along.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.340
Yeah, that belongs in the equation. You're correct.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.500
The one thing

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.900
that's really critical when it comes to A.B. testing,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.180
crafting your experiment is hard.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.380
Yeah. And that's part of the second part of that second half.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.420
Yeah. You know, your designers are going to come to you and say, all right,

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.100
what we want to do is change the background to a gradient fill,

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.940
reduce the banner and add one more icon to the top row.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.660
And that'll be our experiment.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.620
And your your job is the as the scientists go.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.380
That is not an experiment.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.380
Oh, that's an experiment. Well, yeah. A.B.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.820
No, that's ABCD and Q.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.610
I know it's a slash BCD. Right.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.340
And yeah, it's really hard.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.940
You really want to.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.540
And we'll talk about the null hypothesis and making sure that you like

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.700
really what you want to do, and this is this is true in a lot of analysis.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.500
If you want to prove that I mean, if you go in and look at the data

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.300
with the idea that it's a lot of opportunity for confirmation bias.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.620
If you go and look at the data and go, I want this to show that this treatment

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.660
is better and and maybe if you look and you'll find it a lot of times.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.940
But if you go and I need to prove that there is no difference between these.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:36.380
No, when you can't prove that, that's when you actually maybe have some good interest.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.740
So all those points I'm going to bring up, I'm not an expert.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.090
Biases is is a brilliant topic for that.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.810
Yeah. Last bit.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.930
So it was a yeah, go on.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.090
And there's another story that I'm reminded of.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.810
There's another bias I'm trying to selection bias.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.410
Mm hmm.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.080
Have you ever heard the story about the World War Two airplanes?

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.400
I heard that airplanes.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.840
They did go on.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.600
And because even if I told you I heard it, it probably important

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.360
at this point for you to tell it anyway.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.600
Fair enough.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.560
Then I shall attempt to proceed to do that. Great.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.480
Yeah, I heard that story.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.280
OK, moving on.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.240
We're going to tell me about the airplanes.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Thus airplane story.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.760
Now, so what happened at the NATO Air Forces?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.370
What they what they were finding is that

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.250
the Germany was shooting their planes out of the sky

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.410
because far too many planes kept on coming back

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.800
are far too few planes kept on coming back.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.280
I've heard this. I do know this story.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.600
It's good, though.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.080
And at this point, you kind of have to continue.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.920
So continue. Yeah, I like it.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.040
Well, so do you want me to give away the ending ending?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.000
Spoiler alert.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.560
I'll shut up.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.280
So what they did is they

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.330
analyzed the bullet patterns of the planes that did came back.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.330
Did came back.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.730
They did manage to return.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.090
Did have maybe came back ish.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.860
Go on. I'm sorry.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.220
Planes that returned.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.180
They analyzed the bullet patterns of those planes. OK.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.140
And they reinforced the armor in those sections

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.620
and they they noticed

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.100
that it was having no impact on the rate of decline.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.760
I'm not going to say it.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.720
Yeah. Go on.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.840
I don't remember the name.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.280
Do you remember the name of the guy?

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.240
No.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.240
So there was one guy.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.120
You might have told this story on the podcast before too, but go on.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.720
There was one guy that

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.160
if I had prepared for it today, I would have his name.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.050
We don't prepare that basically analyze what they are.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.930
Are read through what they're doing and basically did a head slap.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.740
You guys are being idiots.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.020
I love saying that.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.620
Because the planes you need to analyze

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.660
are not the ones that returned, but the ones that didn't.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.430
Yeah.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.160
That was my head slap. Yeah.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.280
And there was a there was a recent adventure here locally

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.950
where something very similar happened.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.390
A team, a partner team,

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.270
very much like these guys,

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.710
and they're getting into the data science base and real data science stuff.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.590
And they they've actually several of the seminars.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.430
They've talked about the work that they've done.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.190
I haven't seen the latest results.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.070
I got I got to them before they started doing the initial ones,

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.810
but they were trying to do churn prediction.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.740
OK, and I said, well, that's fantastic.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.420
What are you defining as churn?

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.220
Well, when they stop logging in. OK.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.290
Now, one of the discussions when you talk about churn prediction,

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.970
you talk about these statistics known as precision and recall.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.020
OK, and I'm not going to go into it now, but the important one is precision.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:12.000
And that's basically how well the algorithm predicts the truth.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.560
Correct. OK, so you apply it to the old test data

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.680
and then it tells you how good you did. OK.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.720
And they had a 70 percent precision on their algorithm.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.840
I'm like, that's fantastic.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.760
What features do you use?

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.480
Now, for those who aren't data scientists,

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.360
features in this context don't mean product features,

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.520
but it's essentially a fancy way of saying

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.600
what are the data points you're looking at?

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.080
OK, and he's like, oh, that's easy.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.620
We just looked at logins.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.060
And I'm like, OK, so you're using logins to predict logins.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.090
So let me guess what your churn prediction has determined

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.210
when people stop logging in, they're going to churn.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.610
He's like, yes.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.660
I'm like, that's because that's exactly what you're measuring.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.020
That needs a little bit more than a head slap.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:11.180
Yeah. And I'm like, you need to go up a stack

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:17.200
and determine what are the actions other than login

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.760
that are likely to predict that the next session is they're not going to log in.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.760
And so they have enhanced it.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.490
They're still heavily using login, but they're now pivoting

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:33.330
their their turn prediction more around frequency and recency of logins.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.730
So they've pivoted more towards a time series analysis,

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.810
which makes it a bit more valuable.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.370
Anyway, I'm just like, well, of course.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.250
But then I asked the important question, wait a minute.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.450
How is your precision only 70 percent?

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.680
And they don't know the answer.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.840
They didn't know the answer to that one.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:59.600
Right. And which implies that people make a decision actually to to not come back.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.150
But they're still following a normal login pattern.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.750
Very interesting.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:13.430
That both confirmation bias and selection bias are very seductive.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.670
That they're there.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.190
You want to be right.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:26.840
And the I tell people if you're going to be in a data science space, especially

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.510
being right is what's important.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.020
Credibility, the credibility of your data is what's important.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:43.020
And even one instance of being wrong hurts you.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.980
Yeah, a lot.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.380
This is why communication communicating things in terms of confidence intervals

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.380
and and going through a structured way of designing your experiment

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:02.650
and getting it reviewed with the intent of telling people,

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:08.050
I need to make sure I am explicitly filtering out confirmation and selection bias.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:13.570
This is why I think people rather than what I've seen done on some teams

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.690
where let's take all these people that used to do this thing and make them data

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:22.210
scientists is let's just let the people who know what the hell they're doing

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:28.020
or are committed to learning what the hell to do are doing this.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.590
I think there's this gap between data science and data guessing.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.320
That I want to that just it scares the crap out of me.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.360
Yeah, I don't see a whole lot of data guessing, but if I did, I bet you it would be

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.320
wrapped under the shroud of what I do see, which is data puke reporting.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.520
Yeah, as you see data puke.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.000
But but for data guessing, I'm talking about the decisions made

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.640
with selection bias, confirmation bias.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.640
Like I've I've I've I've I have some data and I made a completely wrong choice

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.480
about it because I didn't look at it objectively or apply some principles

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.760
around confidence, confidence levels, etc.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.680
There's a couple of instance instances where I did.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.160
So it's what's known as EDA.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.920
Have I used that acronym before?

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.720
No, but you've certainly used a lot of weird acronyms.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.920
EDA is exploratory data analysis.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.280
Oh, yeah.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.320
If we were in dev, it would be XDA.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.060
And that's probably what caused confusion.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.420
Long story, not going to repeat it.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:34.860
Yeah.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.580
But it's a good one.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.020
You should go back to that podcast.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:38.820
Go search.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.420
Hey, be testing for.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.380
Hey, Brent.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.380
STFU.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.650
Yeah, I can guess what that means.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.210
I'm moving on.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.570
It's important to do exploratory data analysis.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.930
And I did I did something very recently.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.810
Like I can't talk about it here, but I did something very recently.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:03.820
And I have found what appears to be a significant customer, not only

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:09.780
a significant, but if the data holds true, it would be the single most

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:15.780
significant customer segment for the team that I'm on right now that no one

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:20.700
knew about or it would end up being the single most important customer segment.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.060
But no one talks about it as if no one knows about it.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.850
And it's primarily because how they're looking at the data.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.730
They're not able to observe this.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.060
Now, so when I walk people through the story and I show them the data,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.560
I make it very clear.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:42.770
Now I'm very excited about this and I'm very happy to share it with you, but

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:47.970
you cannot go off and explain it as truth because I have not gone through

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:54.050
yet and validated that this still holds true against the entire population.

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.890
I have a, I have a small sample set.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.130
It holds true here.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:04.900
I now need to test it against the whole sample set to make sure it still holds

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:10.310
true and if it does, then I'm going to start going through and understanding

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:15.940
a little bit more about this customer base because again, no one knows about it.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.740
Would the, um, in this case, would the null hypothesis be to prove that this

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:25.520
customer segment has, is not important as compared to the others?

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:34.710
The whole, the null hypothesis would be, let's say my, the distribution

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.950
that I've drawn together, the distribution of this customer segment.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:44.380
Uh, in essence is not important, is not significant.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:44.620
Right.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:45.460
Right.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.260
I think I kind of said that.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:47.740
You did.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.300
All right.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:48.700
Great.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.940
I was briefly trying to think through the more data science-y way of doing it,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.740
but I failed to do it.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.700
It wouldn't time a lot of it.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.140
Hey, guess what?

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:56.740
Yeah.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.500
Guess what?

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:58.870
Red.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.550
Oh, so close.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.750
The answer is mailbag.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.900
Oh, it feels good.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.700
What has that been two months?

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.660
It's been a while since we've done a mailbag.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.220
Yeah.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:12.860
All right.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.540
We don't really have one.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.180
I just wanted to say that.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.420
I'm kidding.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.300
I'm kidding.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.140
We do.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:17.900
We do.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.180
We do.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.140
Um, a couple of things.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.660
Always appreciate the comments, always appreciate the corrections,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.020
always appreciate the snarkiness.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:28.100
Um, one quick, or the help, like, uh, do you remember episode 22?

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.420
Yeah.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.340
Um, where we,

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.220
Oh, yes, there it is.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:31.580
Yeah.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.860
I did Brent.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.620
I had no idea how to say 22 in German.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.140
Brent gave it a shot.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.700
And fortunately our former colleague Ron Pilgrim corrected.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.540
And I'm not even going to try and say it because my German is horrible.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:47.900
Of course.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.460
So now we know that.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.100
Yeah.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.620
Um, Hey, and then Matt helped us out.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:57.300
We were talking about last time are, you know, people finding episodes.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.420
We're doing a little bit of exploratory analysis on our downloads, et cetera.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:06.330
And then sometimes, uh, there's a face slap comment, like, uh, your RSS feed only

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.290
shows the last 10 episodes and nobody knows the other ones exist.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.930
So I changed the RSS feed to show all the episodes and we'll see if that makes a

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.650
difference, but anyway, great advice.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:20.790
Was he just saying, Hey, this would add value to his life or was he saying,

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.030
he said, or was this a hypothesis for all the bad things we did?

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.110
It was a hypothesis.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.070
Look, I started listening recently and I can only see back 10 episodes.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.790
I didn't know the other ones.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.070
You even have posts anywhere.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.790
And I said, I'm using up all kinds of storage on my server.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.350
Might as well show them all.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.750
So we'll see if it makes a difference.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:41.310
He said, he started listening the most recent and then worked backwards and

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.190
it didn't look like one was available.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.910
Yeah.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:49.460
But if there's only 10, the last 10, but we see one, two, three, four in the

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.580
middle, some five is the bottom.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.780
I'm not saying everybody found them, but look, it doesn't hurt.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.140
No, Matt, you're fantastic.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:58.460
Thank you.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.500
Love it.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:33:59.940
Yeah.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.580
And you can tell Brent to STFU anytime you want.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:09.990
And then, uh, there was a, a thread on Twitter that, uh, brand wanted to

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:11.190
talk about if I could find it.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:12.310
Yeah.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.510
I had made, uh, and I'm going to use this in one of my talks.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:21.670
I forget which one, um, but we've all, many of us in testing.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.030
I don't like to generalize have, uh, adopted the Jerry Weinberg quote

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.830
around quality where quality is value to some person.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.580
Actually it's.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:32.570
So you quoted him.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.610
That is, well, no, no, you did it.

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:36.330
I get it.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:36.890
Would you?

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:37.650
I am.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:38.780
Go ahead.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.180
All right.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.820
Brent, I'm muting you.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.620
So, and I believe that quality is value to some person that makes sense.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.380
And there's all kinds of context around that, et cetera.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.260
So I was thinking about the who owns quality question.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.900
And, and then I thought I would twist that with that and make it my little

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.460
recipe and then Brent liked it.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.740
And then discussion happened.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.100
So if we were to say a quality is value to some person and some person is the

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.660
customer or the user of the software.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:14.300
And, uh, can we ask who owns creating value for the customer quality?

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.140
So quality is value to some person who creates value for the customer.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.300
The answer is the same.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:23.020
It's still the whole team, but it sparked some interesting, uh, discussion.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.860
Well, no, the answer, if you grow up in tests, it's the whole team.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.570
Right.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.730
If you grew up in dev, it's a fundamentally different answer.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:38.260
I guess that's why I loved your, your value add to Weinberg's quote.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.500
It's fantastic.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:46.300
It's essentially a, but I'm not going to go into math, but I can't tell you the

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:51.900
number of times I have had the conversation around who owns quality, or

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.620
it wasn't the, a question mark.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.580
It was an exclamation point and there was a finger shoved in my nose.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:01.440
Right.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:08.260
The, the, because quality from a certain standpoint, particularly this is why

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.020
we were talking about your job, right?

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:16.810
Cause I have now gotten to quality is only the, from the customer point of view.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:17.570
Absolutely.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.010
And, and when, so when we talk about, we used to talk about years ago,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:25.850
then, um, we would talk about engineering quality or code quality.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:26.330
Okay.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.210
I don't use those terms in that context anymore.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.570
If it's code quality, the term I use now is code correctness.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.260
Quality is only the customer subject to point of view.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.660
Now I'm taking back the word.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.300
Ah, interesting.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.980
Yeah, I like that.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.700
That makes sense.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:47.100
Um, the, Oh, by the way, I don't own quality on my new team.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.860
So just in case you were wondering that are good.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.220
Well, so one of the, I'm the quality guy, but I'm just to make sure that

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.300
people understand what it takes to, to create value for the customer.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.540
So Alan, it was actually interesting cause I'm, I am much slower on Twitter

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.220
than Alan is Alan had actually put a period after, after slower.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:06.860
Fair enough.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.860
Or Alan, I am much slower than Alan.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:09.900
Period.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.820
Also fair enough.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.940
Um, so he had posted that like a week before I retweeted it, but me, when

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.260
I retweeted it, it created a tweet storm.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.280
And one of the things that it ended up at one point in time, it was starting

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.120
to become a battle of cliche.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.400
Right.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:33.080
Because the obvious answer is who, well, whoever owns producing value to the

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.960
customer, therefore is the one who owns quality and the answer is the whole team.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.600
And then there's one of my least fricking favorite cliches on the planet.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.900
Well, if everybody owns it, nobody does.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:55.020
And I'm like, no, everyone owns it and they need to be living and breathing

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.020
as if that is the only thing that matters.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.380
And yes.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:05.570
Anyway, I thought that was extremely interesting that the thread did go off

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:13.720
and am morphed into a data science topic where they talk about the D I K W.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.120
Which is actually an old concept.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.160
I don't, I don't like the D I K W.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.240
Uh, would you please decipher?

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:26.720
Uh, it's, it's how to shit or data flows, how data flows.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.800
Yes, exactly.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.680
So D I K W is data information, knowledge and wisdom.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:37.940
See that silent K that's that, that just, it makes, it makes it not work.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.900
The silent K in knowledge.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:41.860
Sure.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.020
If it's going to be silent and knowledge, we should just call it D I W.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:46.580
Actually.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:52.740
So it's, it was interesting because literally yesterday, uh, totally

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.940
different contexts, I was having this discussion with another person who

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.580
was familiar with the D I K W pyramid.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:06.660
The, the current practice is not to have the W it's D I K A.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.680
And what's a action.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:17.650
Oh, that the, the point of any sort of data process.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.570
So I don't know how they define it here.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:24.210
Well, they define wisdom is collective application of knowledge in action.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:28.410
Yeah.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.410
Um, let me, let me read this out loud.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:36.690
Data is decisive objective facts about the event information, a message meant

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.730
to change the receiver's perception.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.010
Yeah.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:45.450
So that's different knowledge, experience, values, context, supply to a message.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.890
And wisdom, collective application of knowledge in action.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:50.290
Yeah.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:57.040
So I like the word action better because the word wisdom is hiding

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.360
actually what you're trying to do.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.000
You're trying to, to change a direction.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.920
You're trying to change someone's behavior.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:10.490
Um, and then the way they frame information is, is weird to me as well.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:14.210
The data is just raw facts, no inherent meaning.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.850
Whereas information is that data.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.990
Contextualize semantic meaning.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.550
You have data puke data, a bunch of data.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.350
You have some insight into that.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:26.670
Yep.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:31.750
Or, or some ways of organizing that data around, uh, uh, business knowledge,

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.700
et cetera, that allows you to get some insight and from that you can take

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.420
some action to paraphrase the pyramid.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:42.280
The, the way I describe, uh, it's not knowledge acquisition and action.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:48.400
The way I describe information versus knowledge is essentially you've heard

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.600
the term street smart versus book smart.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:50.960
Mm-hmm.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:51.480
Okay.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.400
Knowledge is street smart.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.780
Information is book smart.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.300
Yeah.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:01.340
So you know a lot of things, but, um, you don't need to know a lot of things.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.940
You, but you, the things that you do know, you need to know how they can be used.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.220
Knowledge is about the few things you do know.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.220
You know how to achieve a goal just because you know how doesn't mean you

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.390
do, and that's where the action is critical.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.790
Now the nice thing, the nice thing that they put in there in wisdom is

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:26.630
they're actually trying to say, they're trying to combine sort of collaboration

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:32.270
and knowledge sharing along with actionability and that's valuable.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.870
But I think when people read this nowadays, they go, oh, this sounds like

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.630
BS, the soapbox philosophy crap.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.910
How is it valuable to my business?

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:48.510
Whereas if you frame it as the whole goal of a data science team is to,

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:54.630
is to understand relationships between variables for the express purpose of

00:41:54.630 --> 00:42:01.470
accelerating decision-making or actions, whether it be by a human or by an automaton.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:02.430
Gotcha.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.870
Yeah.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:08.710
Anyway, we, we, we, we wandered a bit there, but I, one thing, just to bring

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.710
that back is one thing I do believe that shocking on AB testing.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:12.070
I know.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.950
We wandered.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:17.350
So to bring that back to a point I just remembered I'm making in one of

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:24.540
my, I think my keynote at star is I believe that this sort of this pyramid

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.620
or, or whatever metaphor you want to use for using customer data to gain

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.180
knowledge and take action is sort of reconnecting.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.780
I'm not saying sort of, I'm saying this done, right.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.060
This is how we reconnect the tester or reconnect the engineer with the customer.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.620
So then we lost a little bit through, you know, what we used to do with

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.980
Explorer charter testing and, and, and the STE.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.780
I don't think we did.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:55.020
Uh, maybe we in general, didn't I think, I think in some places it was lost.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.700
Cause it was all about, it was, it was all about functional correctness or code

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.500
correctness, as you call it, and less about usefulness and value for the customer.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.150
And I believe we can get that through data.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.550
I, I wrote a blog several years ago.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:10.790
Back when you used to blog.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:11.990
Yes.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:15.590
I was about to accuse you of that, but suddenly you started posting blogs again.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.720
You went for like four months without anything, but then I realized I had to

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:25.440
get a blog out before I can tell you now that I draw just about everything I

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:31.600
blog about is, uh, drawn from my work or from things I see going on in the world.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.920
I haven't seen a lot, nothing in honestly, no offense to the listeners.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.320
There isn't anything that I haven't said that I look at that, Oh, hum,

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.240
ho, hum, ho, hum.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.560
So I draw from my job.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:46.120
My job wasn't that the things that I thought the things I could write about,

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.640
do you want to know how to, um, really cool crap about pulling a build

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.320
definition from Jason and then pushing it to a TFS through PowerShell.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.760
Not probably for my typical right list readers, not the coolest thing.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.520
So now that I'm kind of moving towards something else, I'm getting a little

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.320
bit more inspired, et cetera, I'll find some cool things to talk about.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.880
Um, I expect, anyway, does you have anything else important to say?

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:16.780
I did, but, but, but I was actively listening to you and it, it, it disappeared.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.580
Hey, guess what?

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:17.980
Yeah.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.780
Uh, I think it's at a time.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.220
Yep.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.100
We're out of time.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.100
Someone's at a time.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.250
Oh, I do remember.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.690
Hold on.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:24.930
Hold.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.010
Oh, we're not out of time.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:28.250
No, we're not out of time.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:32.090
So in that blog, that's how, that's how we got into weeds.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.250
So there's a blog on my site.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:36.570
Worst podcast ever.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:40.580
Yeah.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:40.940
No.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.220
Not going into weeds again.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.140
Uh, titled test doesn't know the customer.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.540
Okay.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:51.580
And, and it talks about an experience I went through with one of my mentors

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:57.260
a while ago, where for those who care, go to my blog test doesn't know the

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.920
customer, read it, you'll see.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:09.420
But one of the conclusions that I came to at the end of it, spoiler, um, is test

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.940
didn't know the customer and actually never did.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.540
I agree completely.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.660
One of the things I bring up a lot is, yeah, I, it kind of pushes my buttons.

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.980
When I see the, uh, um, I'm the customer.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.180
I said, no, you're not, you know, who's the customer, you know, the customer is,

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.300
you know, who the customer is the actual customer, not you.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.580
So I never heard that.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.940
What I heard is I'm the customer advocate.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:36.220
I'm the customer's champion and it, you know, bringing up visions of, of a

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.420
gladiator and I'm going to defend the customer's honor.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.220
And meanwhile, the customer was like, what are you doing?

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:43.820
I don't get a crap about that.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.340
Exactly.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.260
None of that matters to me.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.740
I'm reacting to your comment of reconnecting tests, which I think in your

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.900
audience is probably the right way to phrase it, but here we like to speak

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:01.420
the truth on AB testing and it's really actually connect test with the customer.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.780
Not re not really.

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.390
All right.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.910
Well done.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.710
Okay.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.470
Guess who I'm not.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.530
Brent, which I am.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:19.010
I'm Alan and, um, thank you for listening to episode 23 of AB testing.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:21.090
And we'll be back to talk to you soon.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:22.290
See you guys.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.890
All right.
