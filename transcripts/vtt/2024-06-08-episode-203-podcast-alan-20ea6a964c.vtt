00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.380
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.460
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hello Brent hey Alan hey

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.710
it's podcast Alan more on that later okay it's kind of like Microsoft Alan

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.290
yes so I you know so many things to talk about and as usual Brent has no idea

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.250
what we're going to talk about but yet he is going to find a way to contribute

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.730
because that's what we do it is on my bucket list to master improv so let's go

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.940
yes and okay yes and I gotta address one thing this is the AV testing podcast where

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.180
we talk about a lot of things and occasionally we say something insightful

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.220
and interesting and we discover things about ourselves and we're gonna come

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.460
back to that more later because first I wanted to talk about one other thing and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.510
that's the other thing we do is have tangents on the podcast right it is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.110
since episode one I believe you know and tangent within a tangent tangent

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.870
inception which is also common on a be testing podcast when we went back and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.190
listened to episode one I was surprised I forgot at that point how much we like

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.190
we're setting up canvas of what we were going to do and I think we may have

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.500
even had tangents then it's been part of the soul of the podcast from it is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.050
minute I bet you we haven't tested this but I bet you it's within five

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.730
minutes of episode one yes and it is sometimes we discover the most

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.170
interesting things within the tangents they're not just they're not a non

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.810
sequitur they're a tangent it's we think of something you know what I don't know

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.410
if this is important I need to explore it exploratory testing podcast maybe I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.210
don't know so one of the things that Spotify provides Spotify is technically

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.010
our podcast provider although it's RSS feed it everywhere your podcast live

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.850
originally through anchor it's actually a really good platform I like it I'll stick

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.850
with it but Spotify gives you the opportunity every week I have a little I

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.170
just take the default question that if you go to Spotify it'll say tell me what

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.610
you thought of the podcast and I've had like three replies ever and if so if

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.650
you guys want to reply there and drive up some interest tangent I've always

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.050
wanted more people who weren't we have a lot of people that came up through

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.450
testing and are now doing other things I'm still in testing listening but I

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.930
believe that our content is applicable to a lot lot people in software company

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.050
anyway one thing we're good at because we're good at switching the stack we

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:14.490
come back to the topic so I got a we found a listener who won thank you Simon

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.410
for taking the time to actually reply I appreciate that so much and thank you

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.410
for being part of the discussion I love all people don't agree with us I hope

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.050
that people that don't like us come back and try and find out more but I want to

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.650
I want to share this with the listeners for transparency this is not to pick on

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.650
Simon this is just this is good feedback but you know when you get that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.980
feedback and it's like yeah that's who I am and this is what he says after all

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.540
that built up this is so hard to listen to for every minute of content that's

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.870
actually useful there's five of boring anecdotes and digressions so the first

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.670
thing I do is go oh well yeah that's right but then if I do the math that

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:07.040
means if we do a 45 minute podcast we actually have nine minutes of useful

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.840
content and for that I am truly grateful and happy and excited nine minutes of

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.360
yeah cuz that seems like too high right right right now so you know boring

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.660
anecdotes and useless those are subjective terms yeah and again the only

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.420
the customer can judge quality that's true of our customers find more quality

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.700
and other things and that's cool this is absolutely I can't I can't be mad at

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.900
this cuz it's true and I think for some people getting more I don't know we're

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.860
never gonna be a scripted podcast I thought about it before I thought about

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.860
like I'm gonna have a topic and we kind of started that way a little bit but even

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.050
in the beginning when we had an outline it wasn't really us no no I mean the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.810
con but the compound thing we did in the beginning right was was an attempt to

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.520
constrain ADHD in some regards yeah but you know I think what really in my mind

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:22.930
what really kind of doomed the the idea of of ever even considering it is

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.970
something Alan and I have literally never talked about we have literally never

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:36.850
talked about constraining tangents and I have asked Brett to stop doing about

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.210
50,000 things on the podcast tangents is not one of them no no we have not and

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.370
I don't know a 50,000 seems high but hmm think about it might be 100 episodes it

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:57.820
might be at least 10,000 about about but you know big number the we have never

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.820
talked about ten just and in my mind what really doomed it was one of the

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.580
first pieces of feedback we got which was the vibe of the podcast is two guys

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.620
bullshitting over beer yeah and then you know what that's we accidentally hit a

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.660
vibe we wanted from get go and yeah and today I'm drinking sometimes I have

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.020
coffee in the podcast it's always coffee when we used to record in the

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.460
morning we're in the afternoon here so I'm drinking some water Brent has some

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.700
coffee Brent's cat staring at me it's awesome yeah so look at that face she's

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.940
sad she's like no one's better me anymore I gotta tell you the thing my

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.460
dog's doing and then I got a whole bunch of podcast topic to get into yeah

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.460
so we got some patio furniture and the weather's been getting better my dog now

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.500
insists not on going outside but taking a human outside with her because

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.180
she wants to be outside but she needs company so I was working outside this

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.580
afternoon and she's crashed on a little outdoor couch on the patio it's it's a

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.740
nice 70 degrees and breezy in Seattle anyway I come to go in to go to the

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.580
podcast and she looks at me says I'm not going back inside I'm staying here I

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.180
said fine stay out here don't cry when you can't get in the door and she's

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.660
still out there it's great okay animals are great okay I got um I got an order

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.340
for things in my head you don't know what it is but I think I want to tie up

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.060
some loose ends and talk about stuff I haven't talked about in 15 months okay

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.460
let's do it so you've mentioned this a couple times and I got it I got a figure

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.100
well I'm gonna go this way here's what I'm going to do and by the way I am

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.260
doing the thing where I'm not gonna go back and edit all my bull crap stupid

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.460
comments and mumbling and Brent's coughing out of the podcast just frickin

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.700
deal with it we're gonna go go go I am trying to hit mute whenever I need to

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.340
cough no you're really you're doing great and we're gonna make this work we're

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.460
gonna be live in fact if we get good at this one of the things I was looking at

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.420
was waiting for you to get here yet this is another tangent just shut up is

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.940
our platform gives us the ability to live stream to like four different

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.620
platforms so we should we used to do that a long time ago maybe we can

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.980
live-stream again listeners let us know what you think we record usually at 3

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.500
30 p.m. that's like 11 30 that's like late in Europe but let us know cuz I'm into

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.540
doing that again should be once but no promises I may change my mind because I

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.300
don't remember the last time I shower but it definitely wasn't today and

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:42.770
before you continue with the the random acts of randomness yes I will share with

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:51.810
you that there was a couple of cool events for me yesterday was my eighth

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:57.290
graders last day of school she doesn't graduate for another week but the eighth

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.450
graders get to get off school a whole week earlier than the rest of the class

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:07.220
is it so they can all go to Cancun and party I don't know like right right now

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.260
for the last two hours my daughter has been wandering the neighborhood playing

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.980
Pikmin Bloom which is the new the new fad app in the house yeah some some weirdo

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.500
just sent me an invite that I'm probably going to ignore okay cool well

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:30.620
congratulations but that was yesterday but the day before I got called in to to

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:37.340
answer the I presented to three different classes in in middle school on the

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:48.500
answer of the way the teacher presented it is I often get the question why are we

00:09:48.500 --> 00:10:00.010
learning this I'm never going to use it when I'm older so true not true true not

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:05.170
in middle school it's algebra you still use everybody that I know just I'm just

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.090
giving you a bad time finish it finish it so I got called in to sort of

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:15.330
address that question nice did you pass out a B testing stickers oh I should

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:22.450
have dude blowing it I should have I don't I brought them home I don't even

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.110
know where they are right now it's been a hot minute since I've passed out of

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:32.950
an A B testing sticker I think the last one was my daughter she's like oh

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:43.120
I got a new laptop I need a sticker here heaven but obviously it to the kids it

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.920
was like a career fair but I actually walked them through a very lightweight

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:57.960
data science exercise where I discovered it so this is a tangent ish I

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.000
discovered one thing that's worth sharing that I did not know until I

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.520
started this M&M's they are made they are made out of two factories one of them is

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.080
in Tennessee in the end of the one is in New Jersey okay now that isn't so much

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.160
interesting because lots of places do things like that but what is interesting

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:28.800
is that each factory has a signature distribution of the colors for and it's

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:35.150
fundamentally different and so what I walked them through I had brought bags

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.710
of snack size M&M's which was and I had to break up into in the groups of six

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:45.270
because there's six colors of M&M's and so the smallest color would be roughly

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:51.150
50 M&M's so that everybody has a sense of the scope on the podcast but I

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.790
walked them through a data science exercise where we use data science to

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:05.420
figure out based on the signature which factory these bags came from and I don't

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:10.340
know that they learned anything from that but man I generated energy but you

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.620
know I knew that could have been from the sugar I knew my audience I knew that

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:23.540
you know the potential of free candy would generate energy and it succeeded it

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:29.040
was a lot of fun I did have a couple of kids come back and go wow that was

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.600
really like I got their attention and they were paying attention to what we had

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:43.740
done and and and then I went on and talked about chat GPT and AI and AGI for

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.860
us it's boring for them they're like what what and yeah it got a lot more

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.700
interactive when I was when I was essentially a local expert on the topic

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.100
anyway nice just sharing that we can go back to did they ask if you knew Bill

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.860
Gates no one I didn't even know Bill Gates has anybody I don't think so no

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:12.500
yeah yeah yeah okay so so many questions but I want to go over this because I

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:18.100
think I'm gonna do this order do you remember no you do you do and our

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:27.060
listeners do when I joined unity back in 2017 we did a segment for like every

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.020
almost every episode every other was a common segment for a long time of talk

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:39.570
about what Alan's doing at Unity and because what's interesting is when I

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:48.470
joined unity I told my boss at the time I said hey I have this podcast I do I

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.390
do a lot of blogging goes I know your Europeans are great I love Europeans I

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.980
said do I need to do I need to be careful or sign anything about what goes

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.460
you know I want you to talk about unity all the time we need publicity that's

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.220
why you're freaking here Alan people know who you are I said okay I'll do my

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.820
thing so if that wasn't why I did it but but the job stuff is constantly my

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:23.100
fodder for this podcast for my weekly blog posts for all kinds of things for a

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:29.700
lot of fodder comes from so it's interesting because I joined NBC

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:36.740
Universal for those of you that don't know yeah I think anytime you say NBC I

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.980
think you have to say it that way I don't think I do I do I don't think I do

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:50.700
I'm pretty sure I don't let me check our contract it says no so anyway when I

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.660
started here I didn't ask I was kind of like it was kind of on the down low I

00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:01.060
was kind of checking things out and I never I was told once that HR would

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:07.500
contact me about like it I did have to fill out an NDA for not an NDA and not

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.860
something for because I'm on the board for another software company not important

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.860
all I have to do is promise I'm never gonna make the company by their software

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:23.300
that's fine but I was told that HR would give me a form at some point so I'd

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:30.540
make sure I wasn't talking about what we're doing and so I didn't and also

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:35.660
they never gave me the form so I haven't signed anything but kind of you

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:42.380
know trotting the thin line between should I talk about shouldn't but then

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.710
it's funny my boss who listens to the podcast gave me an interesting bit of

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:52.070
feedback I'll get into why in a minute which boss that boss or current boss

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:58.150
the old boss at unity he's living in Portugal doing he's like he got himself

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:03.070
he is in the perfect position he was legacy enough and smart enough they

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.430
didn't fire him but not good enough to actually do anything important so he has

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.430
this fellow job where he kind of sits at his house in Portugal and tries not to

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.790
cause trouble while his stock vests but it doesn't matter because the unity

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.990
stock is worth about three cents a share but anyway back to our story my current

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:27.430
boss tells me hi Steve Steve says what is not that is a paraphrase he goes I

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:37.050
want podcast Alan to show up to work more and I thought well this this is new

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:44.010
territory so let me but it's but I'm turning now to my microphone which is I

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.530
and you know what I don't disagree with him I'll get to that in a minute but it's

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:54.510
kind of like do I bring do I bring podcast Alan to work or do I bring

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:59.790
work Alan to podcast it's different so and I think what he's coming at here is

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:09.110
here I have an energy a curiosity a a drive to discussion a charisma a Riz as

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.870
the kids call it and it's not that I don't have that at work and I think I

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:18.030
have a lot of that my team would tell you they get podcast Alan a solid 90% of

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.350
the time but let me tell you without going into you know being too career

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:29.390
limiting it is I can probably say this without getting myself in trouble it is

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:36.460
weird working at a non software company so one of my employees jokes were it

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:44.500
for a media company first and a technology company fourth and and you know

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:51.540
it's a big part of my job is to try and raise the level of of engineering okay

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:57.190
the company but both through consolidating tools and practices and they

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:02.270
don't know what good looks like there's not a high bar so that I have an

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:07.150
existential crisis on how good is good enough when the bulk of your software is

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.230
internal facing and the answer is at the very least the min bar is good

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.870
enough people don't get frustrated and quit you have to work on velocity

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:24.030
productivity etc etc so what's weird for me and this is where not pod this is

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:32.590
where the opposite of podcast Alan shows his head is this is going somewhere is so

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:40.830
me there's like beer you cannot imagine the bureaucracy I the quote the quote

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:46.270
guardrails like I can't do that I've done this for I'm not even gonna pick on

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.910
specific things save myself but there are things that I could do in my first

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:55.660
day of Microsoft as a contractor that I do not have access to do at NBC you

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:01.900
because someone is deemed it's not it's private or can't be done so I get it I

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.220
wrote just so I get frustrated because it's so hard to get some things done but

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:12.420
things like that now it's interesting because one of the things that you and

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.020
I have in common is we're both change agents and we're INTPs and we're

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:26.300
frustrated by inefficiency and like someone every single time someone in my

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:36.950
career has told me this can't be done it is correlated to my next promotion

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:45.900
because I like for me can't is a four-letter word I just like what do you

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:51.140
mean it can't it's just freaking code yeah and well it's not even just coded

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.380
it's policy stuff so I don't want to go super deep into it but what he's getting

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:01.940
at is and I go into this talk I gave last week as well is it has been a huge

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:08.540
learning experience for me I think within my little panacea utopia of an

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.500
org that a bunch of hiring we've made some good progress it's I think I get

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:19.700
frustrated with myself a lot because in any other tech job I've been in the last

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:26.460
30 years a lot more would have been done so podcast Alan comes into Mopi

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:36.340
like you know I just some days it's just frickin hard so I don't want to go into

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:42.620
specific examples not worth it but you know what he said the thing I've been

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.570
thinking about don't go back don't don't change something do you know is

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:59.010
transitioning go ahead what podcast Alan is is there a behavior or an approach to

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:03.650
the add any sort of specificity no no and and you know it's it's kind of like

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:09.210
when you recognize Microsoft Alan weird different right and it's a little bit of

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.490
the riz and getting stuff done a lot of times I run into where things don't

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:18.130
want to get done so what I've done it's interesting he brought this up after I

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.330
was I think it was after I went away to give this talk that I'm gonna talk I'm

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:28.350
gonna walk through in just a second is like anything else is like where I think

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.910
I beat myself against the wall was trying to fix things that maybe just

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.750
can't be fixed right now and focusing on what I can fix and we do it there's some

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:43.790
stuff going on my ass more opportunity for that but interestingly just I think

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.950
I can't was that last I can't remember what I talked to maybe last Friday but

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.520
interestingly right before that last week I went to Montreal and I think I

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.400
mentioned this before on the podcast but I was asked way back in 2019 to give

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.880
a talk at this company called Genetec that makes security software and I could

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.440
not go because of this little thing called a global pandemic I was asked to

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.760
go again last year the year before they could do it every two years and I could

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.640
not go for other reasons but finally this year I said you know what I do want

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.300
to go because I know a bunch of people there and I've been the the person who

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.480
invited me is good friends with a colleague I had at Unity and I thought

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.400
and and and and and and there's now a direct flight from Seattle to Montreal

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.520
so I went out and talked to them specifically on the talk was called

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.120
quality catalyst transforming engineering teams for excellence so this

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.240
was a remember at Microsoft we used to have our internal or they called

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.900
engineering days or the little internal software conference at njex Easter

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:54.970
run when I was there yeah it's been replaced by em was so anyway yeah that's

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.530
what they're doing it's just a little internal software conference there they're

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.090
like a thousand engineers so I was talking to them about how do you get

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:07.810
changed to happen because Melissa was there hi Melissa I know you listen she

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.850
walked through the quality culture transition guide last time she was there

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.410
camera was last year at the year before time flies this is this is a

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:22.010
conference internal to internal to the company to NBC okay no no no no no no

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.690
to Genetek I was invited by another company got a got a got a come like I've

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.850
done forever like my favorite by the way I don't know if shmuel he was even around

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.750
the new more of sold in the industry but I was invited to speak at Intel

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.830
and Tel Aviv once and that was probably my favorite invited conference talk ever

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.280
but anyway back on this subject I go talk I'm being a quality catalyst so

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.580
Melissa was there last time she talked about the quality culture transition

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.740
guide but instead of going over the guide I hinted at it gave him a link but

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.780
I talked a lot about how and and this was in the last podcast not gonna recap at

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.020
all those of you that have seen me give talks before know that right before I

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.620
give a talk or write a talk I vetted on the podcast that you knowing so some

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.020
of that's been done I gave a little bit of history about modern testing came

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:14.220
to came to to be but the bulk of the talk was talking about the problem which

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.580
is the how how do you get people to change and it's all my favorite stuff

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.100
disappointing people at a level they can absorb a couple models around change

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.380
management focusing and prioritizing you know balancing the different you know

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:33.820
balancing the work all those things and and also learning to for testers

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:38.280
because they had some testers there emphasizing and they're they're a

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.460
pretty mature functional software organization so they were already doing

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.500
a lot of this so giving them some tips on coaching developers to do better

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:51.260
testing and increasing velocity all that kind of stuff so it's interesting I gave

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:58.620
all that stuff which is kind of what I do day to day but I don't know it's been

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.140
interesting so just a little more context for you Brent before I let you you know

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:10.460
talk about my job for a while is one media company totally weird totally

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.900
interesting the people are generally good there are a few that don't that

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:21.950
that are I'll be nice here there are a few that have interpersonal issues but in

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:29.750
other orgs not mine and yeah but that's everywhere you know no one million

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:36.310
percent yes in fact if like my last podcast sorry this is this is the last

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.470
podcast actual thing my last blog post last week I don't know if you read it

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.870
talked about I've been pondering this like when I was giving this talk I was

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:49.920
thinking about the difference between dysfunctional teams and toxic teams and

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.960
if you read that post when I worked on teams at Microsoft by the time I left

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.680
teams was a toxic team everybody sucked up to Brian it was just this weird it was

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:06.240
just weird we had all kinds of highly toxic behavior I wasn't gonna deal with

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:17.300
it anymore there is zero to almost zero virtually zero percent toxicity I had to

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.590
let my daughter in I'll be right back it was too hard I'm gonna have to edit yeah

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:28.890
that was a very good point Alan thank you could you add more clarity to that

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:34.850
for our listeners yeah all right yeah just in case I forget to cut I'm not

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:42.250
gonna say what I wanted to say so the point was that not toxic at all

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:50.030
dysfunctional yes stuff to fix but yeah I you know transparency I get frustrated

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:56.610
because there is in a little like I'm used to be able to be that to go out and

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.650
make whatever change I want I can't I haven't been able to find that niche

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:07.540
here everything you know any significant change is blocked because you know the

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.660
answer is things are slow so it's been hard for me so I'm learning to deal with

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:17.580
it people here's my question for you yeah ask away give me give me some Brent

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:26.670
therapy what are you doing to start chiseling like again I don't like can't

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:34.620
certainly swallowing can't vicariously is a lot easier but it's still bugs me so

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:44.410
I'm like okay fine I can't yet that's how I want you to phrase it I can't yet

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:50.250
right because it I think it's different I think it's I can't hear god damn it

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.850
Alan you're a change agent I am but I'm a change agent that's sprinting into

00:27:55.850 --> 00:28:02.250
brick walls and I'm a little bloody well so stop sprinting into brick walls maybe

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:10.160
change it to a jog and and start figuring out why that wall is there like

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.320
million percent yes and and the walls they I'll tell you two things one is

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.080
that's what I've been doing is jogging instead of sprinting so I can look

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.080
around what's going out a little better and the wall is there you know why the

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:29.100
wall is there because the walls always been right and so this is where I was

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:34.860
gonna go next is I talked about this before and whether or not it was actually

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:40.660
done it doesn't matter the story is true true like what is the moral of the

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:51.370
monkey's experiment people will always do what's been done before and continue

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:58.810
to doing it they'll know that they can't change but you ask any of them well how

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:05.460
did this start why is it there they have forgotten it they don't know and even

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:10.020
that the ones that do know because they've been there long enough right

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:16.940
when you say okay well why is it so relevant today right you need to start

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.220
having the conversations and in a polite diplomatic way yeah and that's

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:27.970
absolutely doing you know me I'm absolutely doing that but what happens is

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:33.250
I jog and again this is not an unsolvable problem I was letting you know it's

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.640
weird working in it like in a software company where tech was first these

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.360
things wouldn't exist because we focus on we're focusing on building software

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:45.280
for customers that's not our number one priority so I get I get a little

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.680
momentum I get excited and try and move faster and then I get my soul

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.640
crushed no I just run into a wall after a member focus on what I can do don't

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.640
try and move too fast disappoint people it's disappointing people a level they

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.200
can absorb that level is lower than I'm used to I'm getting used to it still

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:10.760
yeah that's that's the right thing to do but I would also be specifically

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:16.600
targeting the part of the wall that seems to have the loosest bricks so

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:24.510
that you can break through like yeah we have some up with a fun thing be the

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:30.750
osh be the tide slamming against the wall sure yeah sure but there's a lot of

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:35.710
what I can do by walking the talk in the orgs that I do have control over or

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:40.870
influence over and that's that's kind of my focus now so it is the cool

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:45.510
thing is I've told you about this is I can get when I go down to the LA office

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.950
I can get a little golf cart and drive around the Universal Studios backlot to

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:55.680
have a self-guided tour things like that are kind of fun does NBC on Universal

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:03.790
yeah it's called NBC Universal oh okay the literal light bulb just when I know

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:09.830
it's completely self-serving light bulb I'm heading to in August I'm going to

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:17.550
Orlando oh you know we get a whopping four tickets a year for Universal Studios

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.390
but I can't give them away I have to be there to use them with three people so

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:29.220
so I can't otherwise I would just give you tickets okay Steve I'm talking to you

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:39.020
Steve I don't I don't know why this executive you've hired has so little

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:51.870
power but you know let me ask you so like he's a listener he seems to be

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:56.990
supportive of you as a podcast I'm curious what does Steve say when you

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:01.230
bring this up obviously if you're willing to talk about it on air you're

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.670
going yeah yeah you know well he's already here and this is yeah no

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:08.270
conversation I don't think we've had in pieces but he reminds me the same

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:13.310
things I remind myself of which it is what it is focus on what you can change

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:17.630
it's the same stuff I've been telling myself for the last 15 months but I

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:23.820
think he probably sees I have to think about this I think he because I'm pretty

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:30.060
sure my team sees podcast Alan almost all the time we have you know one of

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:35.650
you know one of the things I do is I work on building a team and and sorry

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:40.650
it's just up there work on building trust and and communication and all the

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.090
good things that help a team execute versus just crack the whip and get the

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:52.230
work done so to them I with my with my team I'm 100% podcast Alan 99 99%

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:59.620
podcast Alan but what he reminded me of is I don't think he sees podcast on the

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:05.000
time I talked to him I'm letting him know all the things that that all the

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.720
walls I've run into or all the weird things going on and he hears as many as

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.760
I do I won't give you the details just texted me one about a half hour ago it's

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:20.420
like face face palm weird but well yeah so I think it's so I think it's yeah so

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:27.700
yeah anyway these things come up I do I do think EQ right I'm putting on I'm

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.140
putting on my manager hat and going okay Alan's a little frustrated doing a

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:38.780
little EQ to to not get into the depressive stage I mainly want to talk

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.220
about kind of what I do my challenges at work of course I'm doing platform

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.540
engineering stuff that involves getting other people to learn how to run what

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.820
they build and things like that which they're not used to because it's it's new

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:57.620
to them see I like doing like crazy things that move the needles faster like

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:03.260
I would say I would do things like you know what we're taking the day off every

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:09.460
one of us all 250 of us and bring your lunch because we're all just going to

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:14.940
listen to the Phoenix project end-to-end for the first half and then after that

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.860
we're going to have a conversation around what does this mean for our team

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:24.000
what things can we do what things can we not do yeah my team is doing but

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.560
not Phoenix project but my team is doing a book club on accelerator right now

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:36.460
maybe we do Phoenix project next yeah I would just do well yeah I don't know if

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:41.380
one day would do it if you could get that many people to stay silent listen

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.940
to what audiobook right now I couldn't do it and remember we're all remote all

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.500
over the place at least in the US so at least we're in a reasonable number of

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:56.400
time zones but it could get weird not a blocker just not the right approach

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:03.360
right perhaps not I did I have tested it out individually with a couple of my

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.840
people and that had never even heard of it and I just said do the audio book oh

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:16.590
my god do the audiobook and it literally a hundred a hundred percent of

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:22.150
the time even at a company as sophisticated as Microsoft hundred

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:28.150
percent of the time came back with oh my god there are so many things we should

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:34.910
be doing differently yeah and there is a lot of and I remember at Microsoft when

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:40.570
we did those those engineering days I talked about earlier Josh Williams and I

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:45.400
gave a talk on just kind of what was happening outside the walls Microsoft had

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:51.480
a huge non invented here issue in the 2000s I know you I know you remember

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.360
there was such little knowledge into anything happening in the outside world

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.400
whether it was tools or processes or anything that's why even though agile

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.880
have been around for years before Bing moved to it it was just this new magic

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:11.150
thing that nobody had ever heard of right so but that's it turns out you

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.750
know that wasn't true at a startup at Unity people were pretty aware of what

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:20.430
was going on but I think I think maybe it happens with tenure because we have a

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:25.070
lot of folks at NBC you have been there quite a few years like Microsoft and I'm

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.350
not sure what the correlation is but we have a lot of people who don't who I

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:35.330
don't know if it's a variation of Dunning Kruger where you but it's a

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:40.050
level of knowledge where you think you know all you need to know but if you

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.290
learn just a little bit more you would realize how much you don't know

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:49.570
and I think we have a lot of folks that kind of because they've been doing the

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:55.010
same things for a long time working in the same ways they don't know there's a

00:36:55.010 --> 00:37:01.380
better way you you don't know what you don't know the other thing that I would

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:12.190
say is based off my base on my experience right there are I don't think

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:17.290
people want to be in a fixed mindset I've been talking about this a lot so

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.410
this is a conversation I have with my team when we run into people because

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:25.850
there is some of that around and then the question is how do you teach curiosity

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.570
and you just mentioned a minute ago that was rhetorical for now but a real

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.850
question and the answer is you can but you just mentioned you don't know what

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:37.610
you don't know but then when you have to provide according to armor is what a

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:43.340
suitable means to discover what you don't know you don't know right right

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:51.300
and I think a lot of the people who were when the tenure right being old doesn't

00:37:51.300 --> 00:38:00.580
mean you're locked in your ways no I'm super old and and I I cannot stand to be

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:05.500
to stand as is I have to look for new ways to do things you know how much I

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.940
read it's all because I know that I don't know enough to do what I need to do

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.580
so I need to get more information in my head so I can figure it out it's it's

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.900
sickness but it helps me be successful I don't think it's a sickness at all it's a

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:25.000
little bit I actually think it's it's I honestly think it's the example that

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
others need to to to learn from it's well yeah there there there is my approach

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.200
that won't run into a brick wall I want you all to be like me no I would

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.280
propose selling it that way would would not be a good idea I don't think

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:52.000
it would work just a hunch it's this I was telling you off air beef no I just

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.960
said just at the beginning of the podcast Wow memory going right one of the last

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:05.400
things I shared with the kids around around AI right is don't avoid it be

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:12.610
cautious right don't there's certain things like don't be very explicit around

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:17.410
what data you're willing to share I'm like we have the tech today with three

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:22.890
seconds of audio we can completely phone your voice that tech exists but very

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:29.850
scary but that said you can't run away there's no way to run away what you what

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:34.610
you need to do is be very cautious about your data that part you can

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:42.490
protect to some degree right but the future is going to be those people

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:49.730
who have mastered how to work with AI not against it or yeah avoid it right and

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:53.370
we've yes and that's what we've we've preached that on the podcast many times

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.930
and I also told them one of my last statements which is more relevant to what

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:02.970
we're talking about is that I actually believe that the number one skill of

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:11.050
the future is the ability to quickly learn and apply something new yes and

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:16.490
you won't know what that new is absolutely that's why I think and I'm

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:20.450
gonna get on the soapbox again I've been on the podcast and this is if it's a

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:24.690
tangent or logical direction but you know as you know I'm on the board for the

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.450
School of Arts and Humanities at my alma mater I'm sure I've mentioned it

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.570
before you have for like many years and the reason is is they like me

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.650
because you were a you got one of these useless arts degrees and here you

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.670
are kind of doing okay in tech and the thing I learned and the thing I took

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:44.550
away from college was like not a skill if you want to get a skill go to a

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:50.780
frickin vocational school or a boot camp I learned how to learn and a lot of

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.180
college students don't get that and I think you know my experience where I

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.620
went to school the art students got that a lot more but I learned how to

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.060
learn and I learned to love learning I learned how to break down problems I

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.180
learned critical thinking and those things all lead to that you know that

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.260
growth mindset that was talking about before where I have to keep on looking

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:16.220
for information randomly in a hope that I may be able to figure the next thing

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:24.520
out that comes to me but I think that's I think that's missing and I wonder if

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.520
like my son I think I told the story he went to he started off as a computer

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:36.980
science degree and was and unfortunately or fortunately I think it's okay but

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:41.020
not for him the computer science program he was in was a really good program if

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.020
you're actually going to be a computer scientist and not a software developer

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:53.320
oh okay like organic chemistry and advanced physics were required and so

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.960
he did poorly in those and very good in the programming classes and honestly I

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.920
don't think and maybe that's true for the computer scientists of the future

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.520
but for I would say for and that's knowledge work too so it's weird so

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.440
anyway I think for any knowledge work and Dan pink talked about this in a whole

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.960
new mind knowledge workers are the future and it's it comes from exactly what you

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:22.310
talked about the ability to adapt and learn quickly right that's that that's the

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:28.650
superpower to be successful for the next 20 years completely or at least how do

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.850
we prepare people for that how do we get people who aren't doing that to do

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:38.740
that so I was thinking around you know the folks that have been there for a

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:47.620
long time and like to me and I don't know if this wait to me I think of okay

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:53.860
Alan is probably facing some form of monkeys experiment problem some form of

00:42:53.860 --> 00:43:03.190
I I have been here forever I know how everything works I heard that a couple

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:10.210
weeks ago I'll tell you the story offline yeah the I think I think to

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:16.090
start breaking down those walls as number one right you asked the precision

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.850
question well that's interesting tell me the history why was that put in place

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:27.050
right and I have a tendency to do that very informally that's right out of the

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.490
coaching the coaching habit right but then what I will do is once I'm doing

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:36.010
information gathering intelligence gathering I'm like why is this here

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:42.890
like before I go and knock down this wall I better make sure it's not load-bearing

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:48.650
right for sure if it's load-bearing then I need to come up with a different

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:56.570
strategy but right this one a lot of the walls I've been knocking down around

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:03.450
and like in my career it's like no it's been put in place and and everyone's

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:11.110
just accustomed that's the way to do it right and I'm like okay and I've told

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:16.110
on this podcast and no one understands BBT's in them anymore but I remember I

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:22.430
remember those I was on a team that had shipped three products and it's been in

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:34.850
six years never got their BBT's to pass okay and and I I volunteered proactively

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:40.370
to take that project because I was fascinated by that because to me it felt

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:45.170
like like every team I had ever been on had successfully done that it's the

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:50.370
easiest BBT suite and yet this team which I already knew was filled with

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:57.100
smart people could not get it to happen I would I was like I'm just curious as

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:03.120
to what the hell you guys did to even achieve that result like this is this

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:12.760
is hard to have that stat right and turns out it stems I just went around

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:18.480
interviewed people and it probed probed and probed and it turns out it stemmed

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:26.320
from a belief that if we have our in the end tests be our BBT's that our quality

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:32.340
will never go down so it started off with the principle of I'm gonna have the

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:37.780
highest quality bar for a BBT suite so let me let me redefine what a BBT is

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:49.660
right yeah and and when I saw that I'm like oh yeah we're changing that yeah and

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:56.260
and it was one of the things that I did is I went into the room and I was a new

00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:02.940
I don't know if you can use this I you I've used this in my career multiple

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:10.980
times okay if you proactively assert in the right audience if you proactively

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:17.380
assert I have the singular power and authority to make this decision and I am

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:24.160
making it okay if you do that carefully in the right context no one pushes back

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:32.700
and it because no one pushed back guess what just happened you do yeah I went in

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:38.420
I was a metal manager there and I said yeah I'm making this change this is

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:43.210
what's going to happen we're gonna actually have a BBT suite and other

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.890
people came to me and we're like but we got it I'm like I hear what you're

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:52.800
saying and we will get there but we are moving forward with this direction

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.620
right and I'm thinking about your situation I'm like huh I wonder how many

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:04.410
places like if you were to go in and say look I am the VP of super awesome sauce

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:13.750
and as part of my responsibilities that's a title change request even as and as part

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:17.030
of that role I in fact have the authority to make this decision you

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:24.300
cannot tell me no and then see what happens like literally see what happens

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.780
I'm sure someone would call a meeting to discuss some might some might but if you

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:37.380
say yeah no I'm not having a meeting to discuss a power that I have sorry like

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:44.850
you are now wasting my time sorry I'm not doing I don't know I don't know to

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:49.290
what degree that would succeed but I'm willing to bet at least one of the

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:52.650
things that you're doing that trick well I don't know if I can do that but

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:57.810
the way I look at it is this this has been you know I you know me I can do a

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:03.570
lot of things this has been hard but I still look at it is like if I can do

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:11.170
this I can do just about anything so it's been you know it's been super fun

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:16.890
challenging and frustrating at times but super fun and the progress is happening

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:21.730
like I won't even talk about where we were versus where we are there's

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:28.370
definitely definitely you look back a lot of things that were careful with my

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:34.890
words here Alan there are things that weren't as good before that are better now

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:42.210
that are noticeable and especially when you consider how not good they were

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.690
before

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:54.050
like a politician I don't think you cracked a single eggshell in that walk

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:59.890
yeah it was a long walk so anyway I want to give a little bit because of that

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:05.870
comment from you know podcast down I will work on bringing I don't know if I

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:13.780
can do podcast Alan all the time but I can do it here and you know what and the

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.020
main thing was I had wanted to talk a little bit about where I was and what I

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:22.300
was doing is just platform engineering stuff you know fairly small team

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:28.300
compared to what I've done before but lots of you know lots of room to try and

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:33.700
drive change and just figuring out where I can disappoint people at a level they

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:37.980
can absorb all right that's kind of what I'm doing all right okay let's call

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:45.740
