00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now we're recording. Now we're actually recording in the thing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Yes, and I can tell you on my side, I see recording and I see an uploading thingy.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
That problem was between the keyboard and the chair.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.380
Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:32.380
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, Agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.880
Now, on with the show. Hey everybody, we're back.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.880
This is AVE Testing Podcast, or sometimes the AI Testing Podcast, lately more often the AI Testing Podcast.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:52.880
But we are coming to you from a new platform today because we have officially burned Zencaster to the ground.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.910
It's gone.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:03.410
Zencaster doesn't exist. It is dead to us. It has never existed. Any evidence to the other, or to the contrary, is false.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.410
And the cool thing is I can talk about Zencaster and Zencaster's AI won't automatically shoot my stuff.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.410
So, so, so, so, so, so, we're using Riverside FM. It's so far so good.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.910
Listeners won't be able to tell because it's just, it's recording is recording.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.910
All, all the magic happens in the mastering as long as I get audio at the end. I think I'll be happy.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.410
Yeah, we'll see. I do think it's none of the things that we have accustomed to have occurred yet.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.910
Actually, the really cool thing was I, Brent showed up and I could hear him and he could hear me right away,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.910
which has never ever happened with Zencaster. So we're off to a good start.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.410
I will let you know. I think it record either we're not recording or we've been recording ever since I logged in and I can just cut that part off.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.410
And I don't know if when we end, like what happens? Do we, I don't know what happens.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.410
I don't know what happens. It's, it's, it's a whole new platform. What I really want to know is here's a program.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.410
I have nothing by the way on my side that indicates that we're recording.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.910
Well, I have a little red, the tab in Chrome has a little red dot.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.410
Oh, it does. There is a red dot. I don't wish that does feel more.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.410
I had some stuff to talk about.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.760
Nice. I don't know. But what's, what's, what's new with you? Anything new and exciting?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Uh, new, new, new, new Halloween. That was new.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.280
I didn't, I didn't press it. We had, we had three trick or treaters.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.280
Oh, really? Yeah. I figured out why. Cause I had to, I had to drive someplace.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.780
And there was a massive block party about four blocks away, smoke machines and music.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.780
That's where the, that's where it was happening. There was no reason to come to my house.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.780
Oh really? How far away from you district are you?

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.780
You district depends. One train stop, maybe two miles.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.780
Yeah, I don't know. Oh, one thing I have done, uh, since we last talked.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.780
I went and saw a football game at Husky Stadium. I have never done that.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.780
It's a lot to know. I found number one, the Husky Stadium.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.670
We were up in the bleachers and I don't know. I don't know if it's it,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.670
it was scary high and scary steep. I don't know if it's just me getting older,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.670
but I've been up in like in the bleachers for T-Mobile Stadium.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.670
And it didn't bother me as nearly as much as being up in the bleachers on in Husky Stadium.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.670
I'm like, yeah, if I just trip and fall, I'm just going to roll.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.170
My fat ass is going to rolly polly down the stairs and just go over the, the,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.170
that would have been cool. That would have better on the news and everything.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:51.170
But it was fun for me. The, I'm a big fan of marching bands at the college level.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.170
Drumline is one of my favorite movies.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.170
Such a weirdo. Yeah. If you have not seen it, it's a great movie.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.170
So Brent, maybe you don't know this about me,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.170
but I did drum core for about seven years.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.170
So I spent the entirety of my summer for like seven years straight,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.240
doing shows like that across the country.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.800
It's you, high school, outside high school. So this was extracurricular.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.360
Okay. Cause I remember, I remember vaguely some story around,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.860
some, some authority figures say, Hey, Alan, you're, you're in the drum core.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.020
And you at that point in time, knowing the square root of nothing,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.020
but then figuring it out. Cause that's, that's your sort of super power.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.020
I've seen you do this a million times.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.020
You confidently left someone in the, in the eyes and said, yes,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.020
that thing that you don't know, I know nothing about.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.020
I just wanted to be away from my parents all summer.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.020
And hang out with people my age and do things I probably shouldn't be doing.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.020
I've done. So anyway, did you read my, let's,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.020
let's have a podcast so much to talk about in its heart.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.020
So did you read my last blog post? Doesn't matter. Come and talk about it.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.020
Interesting thing happened because it ties into a story today that I want to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.020
go over with you. So I got a comment on a blog post I wrote in 2012.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.520
And I, I had to go look at the blog post and the blog post was the rise of the customer.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.180
And it was all about in 2012 talking about how we could,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.180
it was basically me fanboying Reese and, and from 2012 talking about how

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.180
only the customer can decide quality before we even decided that as a principle.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.180
I was talking about that. It's interesting that came about,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.680
but not probably not surprising. So I wrote more about that.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.980
And honestly, I sat down to write a different post and I didn't like the one

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.980
I was writing. So I wrote that one. Just kind of whipped it out and got,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.980
you know, it's like the less effort I put into one of my weekly blog posts,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.480
the more people like it. So this was just blah, blah, blah.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.480
Here's just read, read some thoughts.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.980
But what happened was one of my old employees from way back when

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:23.840
contacted me and they were, they were at Qualtrics and were laid off recently.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.840
But there said that post, that's what he said. That's what I do now.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.380
I try and help people figure out what to try and help software teams figure out

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.890
what customers want. But what's that role called?

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.890
It's called a modern tester, of course, but it's not.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:45.120
But I'm curious because you from the data science world and you are using

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.620
customer data to understand customers more is and sort of a question for you.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.120
So I feel like a lot of companies pay lip service to putting the customer first.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.620
They wave their arms and go, yeah, we care about the users.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.620
We do things we think we do things that we think will be really cool.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:10.620
There is not a single product or company had that I've ever talked to or observed

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.150
that didn't say they cared about the customer.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.150
Right now, of course, the thing is, it's cheap to care.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.150
It's expensive to act.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:29.150
And so taking action is kind of what I look for.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.210
You know, that could be you can't boil the ocean.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.210
Right. And I would say from a data science point of view,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:49.710
one of my bigger value propositions to my internal customers is that I help them prioritize.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.710
So I was thinking while you were talking, then what is they going to answer my own question.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:02.710
So his question was like, what is that role or is it the role in a good team is the role of everyone?

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:08.210
The role of the one who's looking at the data and figuring out the role that...

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.210
Just making sure you're really customer focused and not fake customer focused.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.310
Like, how do you put it this way?

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.310
What are some heuristics or measurements or things you would look at?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.310
Let's not talk about heuristics.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.340
Principle number five.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.600
Only the customer is able to truly evaluate and paraphrasing the quality of the product.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.600
What would tell you if a team was living that principle?

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:39.010
Like, what are they doing? Is it something everybody does or they have certain people doing certain roles?

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:45.300
How is somebody... How would you know a team is following that principle?

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.460
Well, I'm trying to think through whether... I have an answer to your question.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.460
I'm also trying to think through this in generalize.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:09:02.490
If a team has a weekly... Actually, I'll put it this way.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.490
If the PM in charge of the feature...

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:13.070
And these are all examples of the thing I'm questing for that would actually answer your question.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:19.070
If the feature PM involved... A feature PM involved...

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:28.100
Has produced their own Power BI that is tracking the performance of their feature.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.100
And it's not chock full of entity metrics.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.100
That's a great sign.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.100
If I can have a conversation with the PM and they can actually correctly define...

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:45.100
The PM, anyone, correctly define the difference between an entity metric and an actual metric.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.100
That's a great sign.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:57.580
Other angles... If they come to me and they're saying, hey, we had these hypotheses.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:06.740
And this is what we did to validate it. And this is what we think is the result.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.740
Can you look over and make sure we're okay?

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.740
Seeing visibility of a more formal A-B testing and hypothesis testing type structure.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.740
That's another great sign.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:27.740
Very similar to how... This, for example, one guy I work with a lot at work right now.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:33.740
And what he does... Now, he's specifically focused on the PM org.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:39.740
Part of your conversation reminded me... You started off talking about an old blog post.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.740
I was thinking about an old presentation.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.740
Do you remember the language you used to use around...

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.740
I'm not going to bother to look at the presentation right now, but it essentially was like...

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.740
Data apathetic, data oblivious, data centric, data driven.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.600
That thing... Basically what it says is...

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.600
I forget the categories I finally landed on.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.600
But what it says is, to what degree does leadership make decisions based off of intuition versus data?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:22.670
And as we see that, we should see it become ultimately sort of balanced.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.670
It's essentially people will still drive off of intuition.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:34.670
But they will not come to success until the data also validates that intuition.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:40.670
Because it's more important to be right than to appear right.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:46.670
I have one guy I work with who is doing that for our PM org.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.670
And honestly, it reminds me very much of...

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.760
I'm even forgetting the name of it.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.760
The big events you used to do for tests.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.760
But he does it weekly.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:07.860
What he's trying to do is show examples of how to be data driven, data oriented to others.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:15.180
Because as we know from orders of ignorance, you don't know what you don't know.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.500
Yeah. I have a hunch. I'm just going to pop this out here.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.500
I have a hunch we're not actually recording.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.760
But I'm recording on my back up at least. So that's good.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.820
So I was trying to figure out how I would know what's going on.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:37.820
I saw you distracted and distant. So I figured...

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.820
I was looking...

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.820
I was figuring...

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.820
Well, I honestly figured something happened at work.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.820
No.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.040
But this is more disconcerting.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.040
I'm going to...

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040
You know, we're recording either way.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.040
We're going to see what happens.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.040
I'll figure it out. At least something's happening.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:01.300
Speaking of work, let me tell you why I had a little time this afternoon right before our podcast here.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.300
Oh, okay. Wait, wait.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.300
Confirm that guest tracks are recording and uploading.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.300
Look for a red dot recording indicator in the corner of their video frame.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.300
Ah, crap.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.300
So I'm a guest.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.300
I think I'm a guest too.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.300
So here's what I'm going to do.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.300
So hold on. I'll be right back.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.880
Ah, shit. I'm back.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.880
I joined as a guest. I don't know how, but I did.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.880
But now that I'm a host, I have extra buttons.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.910
So I'm going to go ahead...

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.910
We have to begin there. We're not going to lose that.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.910
But now we're going to record...

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.390
Are you sure?

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.390
Yeah. Now...

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.390
Oh, because you have some secret thing.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.420
Now...

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.540
Oh, look, numbers.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.540
So now we're recording. Now we're actually recording in the thing.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:01.540
Yes. And I can tell you on my side, I see recording and I see an uploading thingy.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.540
That problem was between the keyboard and the chair.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.540
But I was able to fix it. So this is going to be interesting.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.540
I will merge those two together.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.540
So what I'm curious in is I will use my backup recording,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.730
which is going to have just your recording over USB on a separate track.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.730
So I'll use that and then I'll hook this in later.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.730
I'll switch over to this actually recorded track from Riverside later.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.730
I am curious. There may be a little bit of a difference on yours,

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.730
but I'll let the listeners do. I'll master everything the same.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.730
So after I record, quick little behind the scenes.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.730
Behind the scenes. Behind the music.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.730
Not like I'm VH1. Behind the scenes of...

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.730
Sausage Mekeen.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.730
Behind the scenes of the B-testing podcast.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.730
So I do some compression. I do some EQ.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.730
I do some volume normalization.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.730
And then I cut out all the dumb stuff we say.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.730
So I'm trying to make the sound slightly smarter,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.730
which is basically impossible.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.730
Not because we're so smart. Because we're so dumb.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.730
And then I put the front and the back on.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.730
Maybe some sound effects, depending on what we're doing.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.730
I maybe bleep some things out. Maybe not.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.730
And then that gets published.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.730
So I will see after all that if the beginning sounds different from the end.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.730
But I'm so excited. It's actually truly working now.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.730
I'm not going to be distracted anymore.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.730
So this afternoon, I don't talk much about the day job.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.730
And I'm going to abstract it out.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.730
But I can't say I programmed.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.920
I don't get to do that anymore.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.920
But I had a little... Someone asked me a question.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.470
And there is...

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.470
The answer was hard to give.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.470
Not because the answer was hard to give.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.470
They wanted me to get a list of users from a certain enterprise application.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:47.080
So I can look at those users in the application.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.080
But I can't export them.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080
I can do screenshots.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.080
So I thought, huh, this is what we do.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.080
I thought, I wonder if there's an API. And there is.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.080
So I thought, well, I better give myself a little token.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.080
And I made an API call to get the list of things,

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080
which didn't give me the full list.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.080
So I had to jQuery the output of that API call to JSON.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.080
And so I could take a parameter and put it into another API call.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.080
But first, I had to strip the quotes from it.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.080
So I could call the other API to get the actual thing they wanted.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.080
But that's done. And it works. And it's convoluted.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.080
And it reminds me of all the cool things I used to do back in the day.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.080
Just little 15, 20 line shell scripts or batch files to solve a problem

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.200
that probably has been solved 10 million times before.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.200
But I got to do it myself. And it was fun.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.460
I should have used co-pilot.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.460
You had the vague glimmer of the days when you were still using it.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.460
Exactly. Exactly.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.460
That's, there's a lot to that.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.460
Up until I'm definitely much more management overhead these days.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:01.560
But I always like to find the work that was important,

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.680
but not critical or not time bound.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.680
Even going back to teams where I was a little more hands-on,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.680
I would pick up work for the team that didn't have it.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.680
It was important we do it.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.680
I'm not going to do unimportant work because no team should ever do that.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.680
I found things I could do that didn't really have a deadline

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.680
or the deadline was so far off.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.680
If I got stuck and couldn't get to it,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.680
I would have time to pass it off to someone else to finish.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680
So I kind of missed that.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.680
It's important. We should have a way to do this,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.680
should have a way to answer this question they asked me.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.680
There was no deadline on it.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.680
I told them it was hard.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.680
Actually, I replied to them right away.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.680
There's no way to export this.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.680
I'll look at the API and see if there's a way to do it.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.680
I could come back and say, no, it's too hard.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.680
But it's done. So I got the answer they want.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.680
But I felt remotely useful.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.680
And your title is still VP, right?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.680
Well, that's my title.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.680
Yeah. I mean, it's fantastic.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.680
I mean, there's not very many VPs that I.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.680
Oh, there's like, I know.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.680
And I have a lot of Microsoft have like 500.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.680
I remember once in the 90s, I won't call any names out,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.680
but a very well known senior developer at Microsoft called

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.680
out the fact that we had exactly 52 VPs at the time,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.680
one for each card in the deck.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.680
And I think he even had an opinion.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.680
If we got two more, which ones would be the Joker?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.810
Yeah. I remember in terms of what you're talking about,

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.810
the 52 VPs running that I remember way back when,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.810
when I moved to level 64,

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.810
it was in the 90s though.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.810
And I protested.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:45.200
I was upset with my manager around the idea that he was going

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.200
to promote me to level 64.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.420
Nowadays, level 64 is sort of the top end of our senior land.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.420
Same as when I was there.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:58.420
But, but I protested it because I was like, I went to,

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.420
I had gone to career and when I got promoted to that level,

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.420
I went and looked at career.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.420
Career is the internal job.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.420
And they were.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.420
For translation.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.420
Right. Thank you.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.420
And at that time there were only five openings at level 64

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.420
in the company.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.420
Notice I did not say test or dev or PM.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.420
It's because that was not part of the filter.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.420
There were five openings.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.580
And I'm like, I don't know what you're promoting into me.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.580
My point is, is back then the level 64 bar is kind of very

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.610
similar to the bar today,

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.900
except I'm several levels higher now.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.900
And the principal title, it's great.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.900
There's a sort of, um, I don't know what to call it.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.900
Delusion.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.090
I don't know.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.090
Maybe it's just old.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.090
Yes.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.090
True.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.090
Right.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.090
Back in the day, right.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.090
Back in, back in those days, right.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.090
We were also a much smaller company.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.090
Right. So.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.090
Yeah. Interesting.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.090
A quick, quick plug.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.090
If you want to translate those weird Microsoft levels,

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.090
uh, there's a story behind why they're such high numbers.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.090
We, we had a previous leveling system in the old days.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.090
They're actually very similar to a lot of other companies as far as

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.090
numbers go.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:21.090
But, uh, they wanted a new leveling system to break them out a little

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.090
bit farther and to make sure there was no confusion.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.090
They made the numbers significantly higher so I can entry level,

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:32.160
uh, engineer out of college is like a 59 bill was like an 82.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.160
Anyway, that was FYI.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160
I would go there to compare those with companies where you are

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.160
companies where you know, cause it's, it is kind of confusing

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.160
company to company knowing, uh, like those Microsoft numbers sound

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160
weird.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.250
But the thing is around the VP thing, right?

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.250
Getting to level 70 is automatically VP that Microsoft. Yes.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:57.250
So we, we apparently have grown as a company because you know,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:03.600
Microsoft still is very cognizant of, of payroll budget,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.600
particularly at the high levels.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.600
So my current operating belief is that we have still that we

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.600
have grown, uh, so much that we are quite confident at being

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.600
able to support that there's degrees of the 500 plus VPs at Microsoft.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.600
And, and, and I don't actually know the number, but you know,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.600
our, our good friend James Whitaker used to say that anybody at

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.600
those levels, anyone of our senior level people, cause we,

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.600
I know it's better now cause you tell me it's better and other

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.600
people I talked to who I trust more and like more tell me it's

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.600
better and becoming more fair there.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.600
But as you know, when I was there, one of the things that drove me

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.600
out was I was just tired of dealing with the executive egos

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.600
and suck up ary between a lot of those folks.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.600
I just in the last couple of weeks encountered,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.600
encountered the old school, uh, it'll happen.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.600
But the one thing I liked that, that the finished my story

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.600
here, uh, that Whitaker used to say was that everybody at

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.600
those senior levels and above should like every year,

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.600
every two years should have to interview for and get accepted

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.600
to another job. Cause his, his big premise was those folks had

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.600
been Peter principled up and could not get a similar level job

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.600
anywhere else in the industry.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.600
They were only that level cause they're at Microsoft because

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600
they talked to the right people.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.600
I'm not sure if that's a great idea because if you make people,

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.600
that's a weird thing to do.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.600
Like, are you one of those Microsoft people just trying to

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600
prove your worth?

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.600
Uh, but the conceptually though, he was right.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.600
There was, there were people in those roles that my dog is

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.600
really sad cause I didn't feed her dinner before, um, before our

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600
podcast.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.670
So I definitely liked the, I mean, we both know James, right?

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.670
He, he adores hyperbole.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.670
Yeah.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.700
Yeah.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.700
Uh, I mean James without hyperbole would just not be James.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.700
I went and saw his history of beer talk at his, um, uh,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.700
one of his breweries.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.700
Yeah.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.700
Or is this actually another brewery?

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.700
It's a beer shop.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.700
They take a lot.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.700
It's really cool idea in Kirkland.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.700
They have a lot of beers that are, uh, just made by small

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.700
places, but they, they feature them there and they're,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.700
I had two different ones and they're both fricking excellent.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.700
It was very good.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.700
Okay.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.700
We almost, we almost did a team event this week there,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.700
but we chose to go to a tight place and stuff.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.700
If you ever decided to take your team to Capitol Hill for axe

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.700
throwing, that's like five, five, 10 minute walk from my house.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.700
Yeah.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.700
You know, I'm going to kind of wait for the, uh, the fad to end on that one.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.700
Yeah.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.700
Um, anyway, what I was going to say is, you know, I don't know,

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.800
I don't know that I like, like obviously James's stuff is hyperbole,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.800
but the spirit behind what he was saying is, yeah,

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.830
there is a tendency for Peter principle.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:03.830
I do think there needs to be a incentive, right?

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:08.830
People at that level, in some regards we don't want to lose, right?

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.960
Because they have the knowledge, uh,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.960
and the experience to really drive things forward.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:22.150
But we also want to make sure that they are using it and providing ROI

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.150
back to the business constantly.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.150
I don't know that they have,

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.150
I think we talked about this podcast before, uh,

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:34.150
Peter principle is absolutely been proven to be a thing.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:39.150
I think it was, uh, one of the Nobel prize winners,

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:42.150
I think from 2010.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.280
That was one of their things is that they prove Peter principle is

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.280
absolutely a thing,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.280
but most companies have not found a way to deal with it.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.280
Right? It's, it's no, that's rapid.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.280
Let's not really promote them until they're useless and let's get rid of them

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.280
and abandon all of the knowledge, all the experience that they,

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.280
that they can bring to bear.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.280
No, let's, let's, let's not,

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.280
let's figure out a different way to not throw the baby out.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.280
Actually give Microsoft some credit here.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.280
They're actually better than any company I know at dealing with this

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280
at some level,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.280
because they're the only company I know is once you get to partner level

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.280
at Microsoft 68, it is not a permanent promotion.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.280
I know a good number of people who have made it to that level and then

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280
then drop back,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.280
drop back down a level because either they weren't performing or there was no

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.280
business need for them to be at that level.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.280
It's only at a very, very senior level,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.340
but I don't think you can get away with that at like,

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.370
I guess, I guess at what point are you Peter'd, you know, level wise,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.370
is one thing to figure out, then figure out what to do with it.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.500
I think, yeah, that's a tough one.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.500
The other, the other thing too, that I kind of,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.500
I kind of honestly think about is that there needs to be more holistic

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.500
analysis of these folks.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:03.790
Yeah. If you, if you've Peter'd and it's interesting to turn it into a verb,

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.790
but if you Peter'd,

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:12.950
why isn't it a common practice to then move you back down a level

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.490
where you were thriving?

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:21.070
That, that I never quite understood that philosophy like, okay,

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.070
let's, let's, let's promote them up because we think they're going to rock

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.070
star there. Oh, we were wrong. Let's put them back.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.070
Think about the person that that's not an,

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.070
not always an easy thing to do.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:37.070
Think about if you're promoted to level X plus one and you go,

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.070
yes, yes, I got promoted.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.070
And this six months later, you're letting go.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.070
You know what? We're going to put you back down a little.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.070
Do you take, do you take pay away when you do that?

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.160
I think you would have to.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.160
Yeah. That that's a tough pill to sell.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.160
Well, no. And I think it's a, yeah,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.360
I think it's a tough pill to sell right now because it's rare.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.360
Right. And it wouldn't be viewed as, as, as punitive.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360
Yeah. Right.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.360
So I think, I think if we found a way to do it and such that it was

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.360
commonplace, right?

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:16.360
People, people do still have the ability to create predictable lives.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.360
Like if you, if you get promoted and this is hyperbole,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.360
but let's say you make 50 K a year and then suddenly you get promoted

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.840
to something where you're making 500 K a year and you know,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.840
how much time does it take for you to get used to that,

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.870
the spending at that level.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.870
And if you were to lose that, right?

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.870
Because I don't know that I've seen so many people go, whoa,

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.870
I'm super rich right now.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.870
And now I'm going to go buy a $50 million mansion.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.190
And then, you know, the whole thing falls apart.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.320
Yeah. I don't know.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.320
I think if it were more commonplace and everyone knew that, yeah,

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.320
there was a business practice where you,

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.320
you could end up going back down a level and with very little

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.480
friction. I would love to see what,

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.640
how that changes people's behavior.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.640
Yeah. I, I, I don't know.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.640
I would love to hear from listeners.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.640
I don't think anyone's going to like that idea.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.640
I will tell you if it's like for me personally,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.760
if it's a choice between a layoff or a down level,

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.760
I'll take a down level.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.760
100% of the time.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.760
Yeah. I think in this market, especially,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.760
I think in a different market, maybe not.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.800
I don't know. I don't know.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.800
I don't know if I like that, Brandon.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.800
I still think even in a different market,

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.800
I would take the down level and then I would go and explore my

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.800
opportunities in the open market.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:56.180
I, I always prefer my employment choices to be in my hands and not my

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.630
companies.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.630
Yeah. I got to think about that.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.980
And what does chat GPT say about that?

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.980
I no longer have, oh, no, I do have it up. Sorry.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:05.980
What's your question?

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.980
I don't have a question.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.910
Okay. What?

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:17.910
Smart is Brent. That's kind of what you, that's summary.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.390
Okay.

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.390
Not very smart because it decided that what Brent meant was Brent

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.390
crude oil. Yeah.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:35.640
And speaking of, of Brent, I did something this last couple of

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.640
weeks and I'm about to do it again.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.680
Actually, I'm already starting it again.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.680
I think you did this long time ago.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.680
I finished the Phoenix project on audible.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680
Oh my God.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.680
So you know, you know all about Brent now.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680
I do. Right.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.680
It, it, it, every time the leaders like, well, what's causing

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.680
the project to Brent, right?

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.680
I cringe every time.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:09.800
But the other issue is with the, so you, you've read the story or,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.800
or audible. I don't know.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.800
I've read it a couple of times.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.840
Okay.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.840
I'm going through my second time.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.840
And I will say, I don't know.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.840
I don't know why when it came out on the podcast, you didn't

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:30.090
look at me straight in the eyes and say, what you, you, I have

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.090
teased you about being a Brent.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.640
I am not.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.800
For those who haven't read the Phoenix project, the

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800
protagonist, like not the protagonist, maybe he is a

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.800
protagonist, but the, but the bottleneck in the system, the

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800
thing that everything has to go through that makes the book

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.800
is kind of the cornerstone of the book is this buffoon

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.800
named Brent.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.800
He's not okay.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.800
He's not a buffoon.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.800
He's not a buffoon.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.800
He's just, he's an owner.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.800
He's in charge of everything.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.800
He owns everything.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.800
All decisions have to go through him and he's super

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.800
stressed because he owns everything.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.890
No, no, no, no, no.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:03.890
You're talking about though.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:08.890
Brent is the IC who is the hero of the organization.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.890
Who's I thought, I thought Brent was the, are we, are we,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:13.890
we have two different views of the same person.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.890
Who's the bottleneck guy?

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.890
Brent says the bottleneck guy, but he's, he's literally

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.890
the only one who knows everything.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:21.890
Yeah.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.890
He's the individual contributor and the problem.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.890
I think we're just, we're, we're interpreting his role

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.890
in the story in two different ways.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.890
No, but he wasn't, he wasn't one of the leaders.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:34.890
The leader was built.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:35.890
No.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:36.890
Okay.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:37.890
Anyway.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:38.890
You're going to bring leadership or what, anyway, go on.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:39.890
What's your story?

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:40.890
Everyone go, go, go read the Phoenix project.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:46.890
So Brent was trying to, Brent is, is, is one of those

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.890
people who knows everything, cares about the business,

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:54.890
tries his best and gets interrupted a lot because

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.890
he is the bottleneck.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.020
He's the only one that knows a lot of this stuff or even,

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.310
or in some regards, he may not be the only one that knows,

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.310
but he's the fastest at it.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.310
And so Brent gets dedicated to these really important

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:14.310
strategic projects, but he's also the one that gets

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.310
the most interrupted.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.310
And so he's talked about a lot of leadership as,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:23.310
in terms of dropping the ball and leadership has to

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.310
constantly, you know, his leadership has to constantly

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.310
defend him because like, no, you guys are keep interrupting

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.310
him.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:35.340
But then it does come down to the fact that's really,

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.820
the problem doesn't, isn't having to do with Brent.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.820
Brent's just trying to keep his head above water.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.880
The issue is that leadership has not created a process

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.880
to scale knowledge work, which is something we've talked

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.880
about a bajillion times here.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.880
But I got to say, I went through, went through it once.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.880
I'm going through it again.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.590
And I'm just like, yeah, this, this, like, there's a

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.590
character in the book called Eric and Eric is like the

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:14.590
sage con bond distributor, but he hasn't really let them

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.590
know that that's what he's doing.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.590
Dude, I want to take Eric out to dinner, buy him drinks.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.590
Like I'm just like this guy, actually, you know what?

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:27.640
I wonder if they made the character Eric after Eric Reese.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.640
Anyway, I've listed it once.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.640
I'm already going through it the second time.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.680
I am finding it still very relevant, right?

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.680
As you know, I've been certified as an entry coast

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.680
for forever, but did you ever read the goal?

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.510
That is on.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.510
That is the next one up on my list.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.510
And it came straight from the Phoenix project.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:50.510
Right.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.510
Because the Phoenix project is just a mod.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.510
It's a rewrite of the goal.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.510
It's not only it's not just to the theme of the off of

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:02.510
the goal, but they also brought in other other principles.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.510
I have also downloaded the unicorn project.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.800
I have not started behind.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.800
I need you need to join a book club or something and get

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800
caught up.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.800
How do you even function in the world without having read the

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.800
classics of software development?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.800
I don't have time to read, but you know what?

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.800
I'm on audible now and I don't know that I'll ever abandon

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800
that subscription.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.960
Yeah, I am just finally I got a brand new book.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.960
Something I'm really passionate about boring building

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.960
evolutionary architectures by boring McBoreface.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.960
And I'm like, how am I ever going to get through this?

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.960
So I am finally getting caught up on podcasts.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.960
So I don't know that I'll do audible books.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.960
I like to listen to podcasts and read books.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.960
I need something besides alcohol to put me to sleep at night.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.960
You could just listen to our podcast.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.960
Maybe, especially this one after I stitch it together.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.960
I don't know if you ever listen.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.960
You used to listen to our podcast after I published them.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.960
I don't know if you do anymore, but I do magic.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.960
You wouldn't even recognize what I do.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.960
I do listen to it.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.960
As the conversation we had.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960
Yeah.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.960
I will say I'm not as consistent, but the ones where I know.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.050
Okay, that one was really F.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:20.050
Let's see how Alan handles it or the ones where obviously I'm

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.050
I'm concerned.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:27.050
Like I briefly forgot that Alan records everything and this

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:31.050
could show up in the bloopers.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.050
So sometimes I put bloopers after the after the end.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:38.050
So one last thing before we go here, as I mentioned in the

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:43.050
last podcast in my little overdub Zencaster who I don't even

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.050
know what it is.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.050
I can't remember what they make, but it did very badly for us.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.050
Lost a big chunk of our audio.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.050
So we're not using that anymore, but I do want to have

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:57.050
Jason back on sometime and finish that conversation.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:58.050
There's some more we can talk about.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:02.050
It's very much fits in in the AI testing podcast,

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:07.240
but also we are looking at we meaning me because I'm the

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.240
producer editor of this podcast.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.240
Other guests, other guests we can have on.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.240
So if you have suggestions, please let us know.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.240
We still got to get Nicole for us.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.440
Oh, right.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.440
There's a couple other people I'd love to have on, but

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440
we'll figure it out later.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440
I want to throw any names out here.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.440
So if you have to just let us know, we are.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.440
Can't see.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.440
Let's see if we can get Jason.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.440
Let's see if we can get Jason quickly because one of the

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.440
things that we ended it.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:40.440
I would really love to hear him talk about AI and ethics.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.440
Yeah, let's have an AI and ethics discussion because we've

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.440
talked about a little bit.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.440
I like to hear where he's at on that.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.440
I think there's a lot to do there and then we'll get that

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440
going.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.440
Well, we'll get that hooked up here.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.440
We are counting down to episode 200.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.440
This is episode 189.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.440
We're going to get there sometime in the new year.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.440
I believe it.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.440
Yes, it's one in nine.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.440
Brand gave me a look like you can't count.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.440
I did just look on Apple podcast to see you to double

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.440
check the number and I do see that we have we're up

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.440
to 24 ratings with a 4.8.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.440
I'm not sure who didn't give us five, but whatever.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.440
So I'm Apple.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.440
Yeah, it's a lot of the three logging in multiple times.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.440
Oh, it looks like one or two people gave us a one star.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.440
We have all five star or one star ratings.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.850
So nice.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.850
Are the comments on the one star?

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.850
No, probably not.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.850
We just have the three with words.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:40.850
So anyway, if you please give us go to Apple podcast

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:41.850
apple.com.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.850
Give us any rating you want, but especially if you're

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.850
a one star, tell us why and we will make sure we do

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.850
more of that.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.950
Yeah.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.950
If it's something like, oh, these guys are completely

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.950
wrong.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.950
Yeah, we're dumb because we care about quality and not

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:58.950
over testing.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.950
Yeah, that's all right.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.950
Well, let's call that a day.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:03.950
What again?

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:04.950
Episode one to nine.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.950
My dog is crying.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.950
I'm gonna go feed her.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:07.950
I'm Alan.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:10.950
I'm Brent and Brent's typing while he talks and

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:11.950
we'll see you next time.
