WEBVTT

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.530
Hello, buddy. Hello. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. Hey, Brent, what episode is this? 25? 25!

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.800
We're a quarter of a way to 100. Yes. By the way, this is the AAB testing podcast.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.200
Welcome, everybody. And Brent is a little distracted because I have my laptop plugged

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.040
into the TV monitor in this conference room, and Brent can't stop staring at the little

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.270
sound files going by. Yes. So I'm thinking I should unplug this so you can actually

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.470
focus. That would be fantastic. Okay, there we go. Not on the monitor anymore. Back in

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.270
the room. Ah, doesn't exist. Brent's one of those people who just, wait, look at that.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.060
Squirrel! So, gosh, we just got off a long phone call with talking to some folks at FedEx

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.340
IT about adopting Agile. I had fun. Did you have fun? That was a lot of fun. One of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.140
the things just I want to talk about briefly, briefly, is a realization. I saw some, you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.980
know how you see something happen, but it isn't until the fourth or fifth time you see it,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.250
they actually recognize the trend. And when you take a team that has not done just any sort of

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.770
culture change, but in this case, Agile, they haven't done it, they kind of want to know about

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.930
it. And there's a point where you give them just a little bit too much information where

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:43.060
they kind of wet themselves. Did you feel that? Yeah, my filter for avoiding that just

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:52.930
doesn't function. You are, you are as to what? It was a lot of fun. The thing I picked up,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.530
and the thing I picked up is how similar a lot of the questions and the problems that they were

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.850
asking is based on the stuff we've been talking here. They sent ahead sort of a sample of their

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.930
questions and it's like, yep, yep, talked about that, talked about that. So I should send them

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.910
to the podcast and they could learn it slowly. I don't know. Yeah, we can get the fourth listener.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.070
I like that my life is complete when the one of the three hashtag actually trends.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.070
So that's never going to happen. But so my life will never be complete. But

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.630
that's a topic for another day. Did it trend? No. One person had a hashtag one of the three. I thought,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.910
what a great hashtag. So that hashtag will be when we do our AB testing t-shirts

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.150
on the back will be, that's what we'll say, be hashtag one of the three.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.130
One of three? One of the three. Sure. All right. Is it one or spelled out? As you can tell,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.890
these details will work out later. Yeah. Working off the carefully crafted script that we've prepared

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.090
today. Not. We haven't talked in, it's been like maybe three weeks because job, busy stuff,

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.450
and we're, and Brett and I are separated by eight miles now. So it's a little harder.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.330
Yeah, we haven't completely worked out the details. Thank you for coming back to my building again.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.810
Yeah. You'll come to me one of these times. So my new job, just a little checking because

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.210
I haven't had a chance to blog much about it, but it's, I'm still really digging it. As you guys

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.170
know, I have joined a team with no testers. We have about 70 developers and there's me to be the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.050
quality guy, the chief risk officer. Sometimes there's a great McConnell book from one of his

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.250
books where it talks about a product needing a chief risk officer who is part chicken little,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:52.060
the sky is falling and part Eeyore, it'll never work. So I play that role sometimes. And I spend

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.580
a lot of time sort of highlighting the obvious going, Hey, how about this? How about this?

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.340
Work a lot with program management. We have. That's unexpected. Why? Why? Because my job,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.180
I better abstract for a minute. I, what I've done forever in my career at Microsoft is figure

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.260
out what's not, not getting done. That needs to be done and make sure it gets done.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:26.340
Our data we are work item tracking bug tracking, et cetera, is in visual studio online TFS.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.380
And the data is one inaccurate and two not up to date. So maybe that's,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.820
those are the same things. So I put together a lot of massively cool pivot tables.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.060
Um, well actually those are, that's, those, that's an oxymoron, right?

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.060
No. Okay. There are such thing as cool pivot tables. So I made some pivot tables.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.220
I highly doubt it based on the, in your case, based on the content.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:01.140
So what I wanted to do, um, one thing that wasn't getting done was reasonable triage, uh,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.660
uh, to work tracking hygiene, et cetera. People weren't doing the right work in that system.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.340
Eventually I'd like to get rid of most of it, but in the meantime,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.780
we're not tracking our work very well. And so I put together, uh, just like a little,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.970
you know, pivot table spreadsheet, pulling data from TFS that, uh, just sort of grabs things like,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.970
like what, from the teams we have, what are their, what bugs do they have? Do they have old

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.300
bugs? Cause old bugs pissed me off. Um, yeah, yeah. They pissed Brent off too. He just made a

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:46.500
grunting sound. Yeah. So, um, I really wanted, and again, it's about pro culture change process

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.380
change. It's about boiling frogs. You turn the heat up a little at a time. The first thing I need to

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.540
do is kind of highlight what is actually happening on the team. And I say, and I'm going to track

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.780
this and I'm going to assign colors to these things. And you don't want to be red because

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.580
red means I chase, I, you know, I do whatever it makes do. People don't want to be red. They're

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.620
going to yell that by other people. So teams bought off on this. I, I, I put together these

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.180
metrics. I said, Hey, here is, uh, what I think we should drive for. And those numbers are going

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.740
to change over time. I'm going to drive the team down to very low bug numbers that they carry

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.420
right now. They're carrying way too many. Also at the same time, the data is invalid. Like we

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.700
have N number of bugs across the product. I think the actual number of known product bugs is

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.300
less than half of that because the team has done such a horrible job, uh, following up and closing

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.340
bugs as things change, et cetera, et cetera. Same with, you know, not marking work items is done so

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.060
that the data is untrustworthy. But the fact that it shows up as red on my screen.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.580
Means what? It means that there's work to do there and they can get rid of it. If you have,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.620
like if you have 42 bugs in your area, that could either mean you have 42 bugs in your

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.700
way in debt or oh yeah, these, none of these 35 of these aren't valid anymore. So, uh, I can

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.780
go take care of those really easily. Well, this is going to drive initially something like this

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.860
as an example, we'll drive is getting the data cleaned up and then I can drive the proper

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:22.100
engineering behavior to happen. So as one example, what's your goal? The goal is to ship, uh,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.860
initially it's to clean up. And then I, as we mentioned in the last hour in our other call,

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:34.500
I'm a big fan of having that product ready to ship within a day or two days ready to ship,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.020
ship. And you can't do that when you're carrying a large bug, a large bug debt. One thing we do

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.020
right now is other thing. One of the other things I'm in charge of, I kind of took over is, uh,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.100
daily quality. We have, we don't have a production environment yet, but we have a continuous

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:55.780
integration environment and a dog food environment. And I, we have some very minimal gates on our

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:02.860
CI environment. Um, we have a set of automated tests that have to pass and then we have some

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.660
additional tests, including some, uh, exploratory verification that has to happen before we go to

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:15.630
our dog food environment. And we're at a point now where at least once a day, there will be,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.350
not at least once, but at least once a day, there's a break in the CI environment,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.550
which could have been prevented by someone running those tests, uh, beforehand. They were lazy. And

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.110
couple of times a week, we have a break in trying to promote to our dog food environment

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:36.030
because somebody, again, things that are preventable farther upstream. So, uh, one example,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:42.430
what I'm doing there is one shifting that right. I hate that term. I should have said that. Uh,

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:48.110
I want to get all those preventable bugs, uh, taken care of, but at the same time,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:55.070
I want to over time raise those quality bars. I think the bars that currently we have on getting

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.830
through our CI environment and up through to our dog food environment are too low. They're

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.870
bare minimums. I want to raise those while updating the frequency. When should we update

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:11.230
our dog food environment? For example, when I joined the team, they were updating. The goal

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:17.310
was to update their dog food environment once a week. I'm sorry. Sorry. Once a day. And for a

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.830
lot of people on that team who come from other teams, I was like, they didn't want to do that.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:28.610
That was too much. And my goal is to get to twice a day, uh, until we raise those bars and make that

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:34.370
whole process, uh, very easy to go through. We're not going to get there. So, so what is the KPI

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:43.490
that you're judging this thing by? What's this thing? So you guys can't see it. Um,

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:54.210
Alan's got his spreadsheet chart. It is a beautiful pivot table. Um, but I hate everything

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.930
about it. Yeah, I figured you would. We could talk more about it later. I brought it up so you

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:05.490
could, you could, uh, yell at me about it later. No, this is temporary. I'll, that's what I assume.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:12.270
Excel is great for tracking. Uh, this, I put you this, I just want to be able to track this data.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.870
Not even track. I want to be able to show the accurate data based on the current state of what

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.750
our, uh, database showed about our product. Eventually, this will move to some sort of

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.230
reporting site. So I can at one, make it look a little better to get trends, which I think are

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:32.510
really important, et cetera, et cetera. I think you're missing the one key goal from this though.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:39.840
And which I don't think is, I don't think you went to this team to, to become their

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:47.680
glorified release manager. Oh no, no. Right. So do you envision some period in time,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:54.900
which I hope is relatively soon, um, where this table just goes away? Absolutely. This is basically

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.340
the highlight where we're are and to, and to use it to drive behavior change.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:06.130
So what is the behavior you want? I want us to be able to trust our data and to see how,

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:12.430
and for the one trust our data, but to the eventual behavior is, uh, some transparency

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:18.320
across the team to know where we are, what we have to do. That's a good step. I think,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.720
I think there's another one there as well. Like you mentioned that you want to be, um,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.140
much more near real time in terms of your deployment model. So I'm wondering,

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:37.700
have you considered using this as an opportunity for that? Um, in other words, rewarding individual

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:52.320
teams for, uh, the teams that are able to get to the highest number of zero or end days without a

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:59.460
bug in the database. Right. Cause what you want to encourage is them being much more near real time

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:05.780
when they're, and that just goes to a philosophical thing around, uh, carrots and sticks around

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:12.900
metrics. And I rarely, um, especially not in a large group individually, I may give you a stick

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:20.260
meaning, Hey buddy, you gotta clean this up below a block, but publicly I'm all about the carrots.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:27.220
Meaning, uh, as T as teams are doing really well at something going to celebrate that loud and

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:33.300
transparent. Now, when I look at this and the behaviors that I've seen from traditional dev teams,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.460
right? This looks like every or any, it's much prettier than, than others I've seen, but

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:48.460
every team has an RM that pulls together a bug chart similar to this. Um, I don't think

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.460
in terms of you wanting to achieve your goals, I don't think you're going to do that. If this

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:59.740
turns into another facility that, that your dev teams used to that creates that co-dependency

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:07.180
between an RM and dev teams. Like you want to have a goal where you're celebrating those teams

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:14.300
that are, this is a bootstrapping table. All right. This says our current assets, we got to

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:23.740
pay down this technical debt, but the ultimate goal is the teams that are able to RTM their

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:32.380
component on a daily basis. When yes. Right. And if, if this creates that co-dependency where

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.940
they're not paying attention to their bugs because they know Allen is you'll not get there.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.740
Yeah, that, that is not the plan at all. Yeah. I don't even, I won't even own this. This was just

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.490
as an example, something not being done through together. So here we're going to use this to,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:58.430
there has to be a way to get each individual team to care. Yes. Right. Um,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:07.920
do you guys have a stabilization period? No, I almost, um, I almost used a bad word there.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:17.200
I almost up the rating of, uh, AB pot, AB podcast rating. If there is one, uh, no, I don't like,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.420
um, on one note, not a plan stabilization period. Eventually I talked about that dog food and

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:32.500
CI environments. We will add a prod environment at some point soon, um, which will update at first

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:40.700
and probably for a while, less frequently than dog food. Uh, because we'll want to bake

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.300
something a little bit longer, look for more edge cases, things that, because right now with

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:50.060
our dog food environment, for example, with our dog food environment updating every day, uh,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:56.140
we actually don't know what it's like to run on one server and one, one server and one client

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:04.380
for longer than a day. The going back to your table, one of the things that I was thinking

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:15.070
through, if you were to measure the, the average age in which each individual teams

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:23.200
knocks out a bug and then say, we're not done until everybody here consistently,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:35.020
every bug that needs to be fixed is fixed within 48 hours of identification. So measure their team

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:42.930
on their turnaround time, not on their account. Again, one step at a time. I, I hate counting

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:53.060
things, uh, but the snapshot is helpful. One thing for context on this team, um, and it's just so,

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.340
uh, we're all on the same page. I actually unplugged the monitor again. So Brandon can

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:02.830
no longer see the pretty spreadsheet. This team didn't exist or just turn over when they formed

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:09.520
three months ago. Uh, brand new product from scratch. You've been there a month, a month now.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:17.900
Okay. So a lot of this is, uh, they did the thing where you're a brand new team and you

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:24.060
kind of start off a little cowboy style and nothing wrong with cowboy completely. But, uh,

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:29.520
time to, uh, I thought he's a bad metaphor about putting a saddle on the horse, but I don't know.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:38.220
Stormin Norman Foreman performing. Okay. Uh, so anyway, other than that, uh,

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:44.510
one other thing I did right off the bat was, uh, we did just as I was joining the team,

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:50.030
they did a demo for a former executive Microsoft and he really liked it and, and some other,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.950
uh, executing our CEO and was there and they said, Oh, we want to use this. So, uh, one of the

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:02.210
things was the first things he had to do was, Hey, Alan, a couple of really important people

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:07.920
want to start using our product. Uh, can you, can you make sure we have the right quality

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.400
for whatever we're going to give them, figure out what features they need,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.150
what level of quality we need and take care of that. And, uh, as of last week, uh,

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:23.950
they are invited and, uh, and we have very important people using our product and liking

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:30.190
it, which is really cool. So I'm excited about that. Uh, and we'll get more on board soon. So,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:36.620
uh, it's kind of fun. When, when do, uh, lowly people like me get to use, you know,

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.820
I could tell you, but then I would have to kill you. Not because you, you would know him,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:48.540
but I, I, I probably not allowed to, uh, to tell people. So I'm going to, I'm going to defer that,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:55.020
but let's just say very soon, every, every bit of feedback we've gotten, we've received gotten

00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:02.140
who the hell says gotten every bit of feedback we've received. I just did, uh, has been not about,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.020
Oh, you need to do feature X. Oh, you need to be feature Y. It's like, how can you reel this in?

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:13.460
How can you get this done? Polish and, and get it out sooner. So I like that. Uh,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:23.150
I like that direction. So soon. The answer is soon. What problem is itself? Are you allowed to

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:28.350
communicate? Let's talk about that later. Okay. All right. Uh, just to be, just to be safe here.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:36.580
It's, I think you'll dig it. So in addition to pulling together bug charts and such,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:47.010
we've been there a month. Yeah. What are you finding as, as big challenges or, or what are the

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:53.410
unexpected challenges that you're finding that you didn't expect or things that you expected

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:59.060
that are much easier? Well, I'm going to answer a different question because, uh,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.900
I don't know if anything was totally unexpected. This is a team of, I mentioned 70 developers.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.220
There are exactly three of us that came from a test background and the other two guys work mostly on

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.260
build pipeline and including some of the, getting some of the automated tests into the CI, things

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:23.420
like that, uh, building that quality culture among developers and getting them to understand.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.980
This is going to tie right into another question I want to talk about today, but getting developers

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:35.380
to understand what it means to own quality and for your feature and test it. And, uh, one of

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.180
the things to talk a lot about with my new manager is, is how do we build that quality culture?

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:47.980
How do we build us? People get like, so they get the idea that, um, they need to really own

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.580
not breaking crap. There's a great threat as an example, great threat I had last week with one

00:19:53.580 --> 00:20:00.540
of the developers on the team around. He came into work and said, Hey, our CI build hasn't updated

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.580
in eight hours. This is supposed to have the latest and greatest all the time. And I tell him,

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:13.650
well, the tests haven't passed. He says, why should that block CI? I want the features in there.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:20.880
We can fix those tests later. And part of me, there's the part of me who wants to go.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.920
But, and then, and then part of me wants to like go grab Martin Fowler's article from

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:37.040
15 years ago on CI, explain how CI includes a rich set of tests, tests passing. We have this

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.840
minimal set. And then when I realized those are the first two thoughts went through my head,

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:49.380
like in five seconds. And then I realized there's really just a lack of education and

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.420
education is the wrong word there. Maybe it's, uh, awareness, transparency, like what exactly

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.820
do these things mean? And like, there isn't a shared understanding of what our CI environment

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:05.060
is for. Uh, and we're not talking about unexpected. Um, I'm probably most surprised

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.420
by so many things that I find, you know, some transparency around definitions of what things

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:16.100
mean. That is when a team is fairly small, there's not a lot of shared understanding

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:21.860
of like what environments are for what things mean, what, uh, how, you know, some

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.260
given that they're highly cowboy, I guess that isn't unexpected just yet.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.860
Yeah. And they're not real. And again, I think the cowboy has been reeled in mostly. There was

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.820
a big push to get this minimum viable product out there. And I don't know if it's what you

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:41.680
intended to say, but one of the things that you said that I found very interesting is no,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:51.410
the CI should have happened. Um, this, this code base is supposed to have the latest and greatest,

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:57.810
but what you said was we can fix the tests later. I didn't say that. That's what, that's what I

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:05.300
heard. In other words, Oh, yeah. And then the, the, the features work. If the tests are failing,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:12.750
it's because the tests are wrong. In some cases, yes. But the tests are wrong

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:17.310
because the developer changed a feature that in a way that required a test update that they own.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.800
It's been years since I've had to deal with this particular product.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:31.060
For me, it's been about three days. Yeah. Um, so yeah, interesting. So,

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:40.180
so a lot of, uh, you're doing a, uh, cool new sexy product, right. Uh, modern age product.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:49.070
With what? 2003 execution model. Hey, are you even that high?

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:55.790
Uh, considering the last team I was on was about 1993 execution model. I'm pretty ecstatic and I

00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:01.710
figure with this size of a team and my, and my, I'm confident I can bring this team up to the right

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:06.670
decade within the next, even within the next couple of months. That'd be great. So that's,

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.750
I'm, I'm totally confident on that. Uh, part of it is, you know, you just don't,

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:16.030
again, I've talked a lot about with my manager around building that quality culture and you can

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:23.390
just demand it from the top, but you need, but that's really risky and you want to find ways to,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:28.350
in my experience, finding ways to kind of find pockets, you know, celebrate things are going well,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.430
promote it organically. There's all kinds of low hanging fruit that I think will help,

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.710
uh, each one of these could bring the team forward a full year. And it's,

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.310
and it's a practice, but I think we can get there. So the key thing is to,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:49.540
is to measure what the business wants and not necessarily measure the symptoms. Correct.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:58.990
The behavior of the business wants in this particular case is, I think that, that developer

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:09.340
freaking out around the test failing and, um, his response isn't, uh, Oh, Alan, we can,

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:16.060
silly Alan, we can fix the test later. Right. Uh, his response should be, Oh crap. Really?

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:22.940
To me, it's, it really comes down to, uh, this is a more junior developer, but a very vocal one,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:28.300
uh, really comes down to lack of that lack of shared understanding what the environment was for.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:35.660
He, uh, it became very clear in our conversation, the, he was using the CI build as his private

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.820
test bed rather than actually building and running it locally on his machine for that.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.660
He wanted to be able to go to someone and say, Hey, check out this feature. What do you think?

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:54.420
And use CI for that. I don't, I don't see a problem with that. As long as you, well,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.080
as long as you understand what it's for, go ahead and do it. Um,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:09.460
um, this is something my, my dear old dad used to say is, uh, not going to condone any sort of, uh,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:18.830
behavior. You, you make up your own mind in terms of your, your, what you want to do and why you

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:29.250
want to do it, but you must always be willing to pay the Piper. So if you're going to do something

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:36.770
that sort of is leapfrogging over the, the rationale for the existence of the system,

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:45.490
go ahead. Maybe you'll find some innovative way to, uh, move things forward. But if it fails,

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:50.270
you need to be the one accountable for making that, that decision. Um,

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:58.290
All right, you're done. I am. So one thing, uh, that we touched on that I want to talk about is

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:03.650
last week, no earlier in the month, two weeks ago, there was an article on SD times, um,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:10.100
by a Martin Mudge and I'm not going to read the whole article, but the title is why developers

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:16.020
shouldn't perform software testing. And the article was about, you know, it's a lot of these,

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.580
what I call myths I've heard before. And I had a prominent software test for Tommy. It's not a

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.650
myth. It's true. So the, the concept is, is like, I, you wrote this code. You couldn't

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:31.760
possibly write a test for it. And there's a summary of the article. Uh, and to me,

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:39.280
I think because you wrote that code, you absolutely should know how to test it because

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.520
you, you know better than anyone, how it works. I think where, let me finish for you,

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:51.200
for you to make that, uh, that judge there, that, that jump there is in a profession where

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:58.350
software testing where people value themselves on their critical thinking. I'm sort of blown away

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:04.670
again by this, uh, black and white binary view on developer testing. Developer testing doesn't

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:12.590
mean that they do absolutely every bit end to end 100% of, of all the testing needed for that

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:17.550
component and how it fits into the product, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Uh, that is a little

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:24.140
crazy. And although I, I, after saying that there are, there are places where that is absolutely

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:29.180
correct where you can do that and then get everything else you need from, uh, telemetry,

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:37.180
et cetera, et cetera. But I think in the bulk of cases, we absolutely, I, as a tester,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:44.460
as the only sort of quality test guy on this team of 70 absolutely need every single developer to own,

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:50.780
uh, unit functional integration tests for their component. I think they're highly capable and

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.420
there is, it's absolutely not a myth that they absolutely are the, maybe not even capable of

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.980
doing that, but in many cases, the best people to do that. And if not, we could help them get

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:05.260
better at that. But the, the, uh, well, I'm still up on my soapbox. This binary view of

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:10.780
either developers do no testing or every single bit of testing is ridiculous. And even last time we

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.620
talked about this role of the functional tester going away. And by functional tester, I mean the

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:19.020
guy that writes all those unit and functional integration tests for the developer, uh, that

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:24.540
absolutely, those tests absolutely need to live on the developer's plate as far as making sure

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:29.020
the product works and making sure the screen doesn't turn pink and doing exploratory testing.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:36.060
Absolutely. Probably not the right people. We inspired actually our last, uh, podcast

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:44.880
inspired a, uh, blog. Yeah, Josh. Yeah. Although right now it's not, uh, his message seemed to be

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.860
aligned with kind of both points of view. Anyway, back to your, your system test.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:58.320
It seems like it's an important thing. Great. So with, with my data scientists hat on,

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:08.560
like why wouldn't we want devs, um, testing their own code? Uh, and it's, uh, in a nutshell, it's, it's,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.000
um, confirmation bias would be the main reason why we wouldn't want them doing that. Right.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:20.020
As they wrote their code, they had certain assumptions in their mind and their tests are

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:25.540
going to carry those same assumptions. But then the, so I, I see where those folks are coming

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:32.430
from. I don't agree with it, but I see where they're coming from. Well, again, I'm going to

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:37.230
throw out the, the, the critical thinking card here for a moment and use a technique. Uh, I'm

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:41.710
sure it's a name for this that I'm going to get lambasted for not knowing, but whenever I look

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.830
at a problem that someone treats as binary, whether it's waterfall versus agile, whether it's,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:52.750
you know, developer testing versus no developer testing, take a moment to examine both sides

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:58.270
of that, uh, argument. Cause the answer is usually in the middle, right? So what would happen if the

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:02.270
developer was in charge of every single bit of testing? Well, some user experience stuff may,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.550
may get through and you could brainstorm about, you know, you know, there's some integration

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:11.950
points that automated tests can't find all fine, all valid points. So then think what about the

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:16.670
other extreme? What about the test? The developer does no testing. What happens? Well, the tester

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:21.790
spends most of his time finding functional bugs. Uh, you know, it's, you'd spend a lot of time

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.550
going back and forth between bug fix and fix for the bug fix and fix for that bug fix and

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:31.390
the emaggressions and related things. So that's not super ha super great either. So for that point,

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:37.630
you have to, you have to realize the answer is somewhere in the middle. Yes. And, uh, I think

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:44.670
it's very, and again, my exercises, when you think, when you see a binary argument is look at both

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.710
extremes, think about what the middle looks like and think about, it doesn't have to be

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:53.580
exactly in the middle. In my case, it's as far as that functional side. And I've used, uh,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.980
you familiar with, uh, the agile quadrants that are in, uh, Lisa and Janet's agile testing book

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:02.140
that they took from Brian. Yeah. I'm familiar with them. I don't have them memorized. Look them

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.180
up. I'm not going to draw them on the table here, but when I look at, uh, the agile quadrants,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.740
I think you did a blog on this. I did, but no, but no, actually I think more people now listen

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:18.780
to our podcasts and read my blog. But that left side of the quadrant is all about the developer

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.620
things. The developers should be doing unit testing. Those are their functional integration

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:28.380
all the way up to even using, uh, tools like, um, uh, static analysis tools, dynamic analysis tools,

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:33.500
all on the developers, uh, the developers should own that testing. Traditionally test has done

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.380
a lot of that, um, if not all, but the right side where those user facing things,

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.780
where you're doing exploratory testing, performance security, again, some of those can be done by the

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:50.380
developer be really those things often fall in that testing world. But again, they'll vary from

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.300
product to product, context to context, team to team, where you may have specialists on the development

00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:02.450
team that own those things. But the key thing is, is I think it's just ridiculous beyond like,

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:06.290
uh, an oversight, but ridiculous things that developers can't own any testing at all.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:11.330
So let me give you another, let me get up in my soapbox. No, I completely agree. The person

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:16.850
that argued with me, I don't think he, as he often does, he sort of, uh, I think jumped on

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.170
my tweet out of context a little bit, which is fine. Um, I do that all the time as well.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:28.530
So no, no big deal there. But he, um, made a comparison of having someone proofreader edit

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:33.280
your work. Like here's, you know, Brent, if I give you a paper I've written and I want

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.360
feedback on it, that's sort of the exploratory testing of my, of my document. You're going to

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.080
give me sort of that I don't, I've done what I can, but I can't find everything. I, because I'm,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.880
I'm too close to that work. Totally get that. But in the meantime, I have heavily edited my

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:55.680
doc by hand. I've run spell check. I've run grammar check. I've, uh, you know, done a massive

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.160
amount of, I haven't just done a stream of thoughts spit and said here, Brent, would you

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.010
review this for my, for whatever, you know, I wouldn't, I would do that work beforehand.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.930
So that's a, uh, for me, that's a parallel. Like when I write a paper for, uh, whether it's a

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:15.170
chapter for a book or a article for a magazine or a paper for a technical journal, I do a heavy

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:20.210
amount of editing before I give it to that editor. So that is to me, the equivalent of,

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:26.690
uh, the developer owning a lot of quality of that paper, but at some point passing it off

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:31.570
for that second set of eyes to kind of get, to get it over that, uh, over that next hump.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:41.070
One of the, so again, going back to the developer contest or not, right. One of the key principles

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:48.020
that they bring this up is again, they want to defeat confirmation bias. So then the question is,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:55.700
is there, if that's true or, or it's actually two reasons. You would want someone else to

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:01.300
do the testing for you in order to defeat confirmation bias, right? Um, I can't tell you

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:09.460
when I do a blog, um, I will post it immediately, but then I will, I will reread it over the

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:15.780
course of the next month. And I'm generally doing edits every single time, because when I first

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:22.110
read through it, there are things that I didn't, there are things that I don't see as flaws in,

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:27.390
in what I've written. That's kind of an example of using, uh, uh, MVP for your blog. Like here's

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:31.230
the basic concepts out there and whether it's reaction to feedback, your own editing, you're

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:36.350
going to tweak that as you go along. Sure. Honestly, cause I don't have Alan's talent.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:43.550
Alan can write up a brilliant blog posts within around 20 minutes to a half hour. Um,

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.830
me, it takes closer to four hours. So usually when I post it, I'm just

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:53.470
done with that for today. What I've, this is an interesting anecdotal metric. I find that the,

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.660
the less time I spend writing a blog post, the more feedback and hits it gets.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:05.340
I've noticed that as well. Every time I posted a blog and I'm like, uh, that is the worst one

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.940
ever. That's the one I get all the, the five star comments and, and, and I'm like,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:17.020
okay, I, I just don't understand how to do this blog thing. Anyway, confirmation bias is one of

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:24.610
the things. The other one is that there's a specific domain of knowledge that, that the

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:32.290
developer doesn't have. Okay. Now that second one is often broadened into well, testing is a specific

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:41.440
domain of knowledge and it freaking is not right. Perf that's a specific domain of knowledge,

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.040
uh, security. That's a specific domain of knowledge. Uh, now this will sound odd, but

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:53.810
even doing integration across multiple components is a specific domain of knowledge, even though it's

00:35:53.810 --> 00:36:00.050
sort of global scope, it takes a lot of work to sort of understand the business context around

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:07.170
how everything should integrate on a sufficiently complex system. Now the question is, is can we

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:18.720
develop a testing strategy that involves devs only or mostly devs that removes the, the dependency

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:26.000
or removes the need to avoid confirmation bias and, or specific domain of knowledge.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:33.460
And the domain of knowledge, I don't really know of a very good strategy for that one. Uh, uh,

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:42.100
you could hire a couple people, vendor it out. If you have a sufficient deployment system,

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:47.700
you can even do, you know, fighting with exposure rings. Um, on security testing,

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:54.660
you probably don't want to do that. Right. Um, but to defeat confirmation bias,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:02.620
right, at the folks that go, well, much like the editor example, um, the problem with that

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:11.020
is that there is a assumption around how stuff gets done editing. You can't do pre writing,

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:22.620
but testing, you can do pre writing. If, if there was a way for me to edit your blog post before

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:29.820
you've written the blog post, then we could probably get rid of your editor as well,

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.940
because if you could do it, you could be your own editor before the blog

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:40.830
and then, um, start writing the blog. Um, does that make sense? You're staring at me like, um,

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:47.310
yeah, I get again babbling on endlessly. Well, that's just how I look at you, Brent. Ah, gotcha.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.440
Hey, um, one of the thing I want to get up in my soapbox about, and then I want to go on to the,

00:37:53.440 --> 00:38:01.360
um, the, the, the fun item is, uh, you're talking about testing. What was your comment? So testing

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:09.390
is not, um, uh, shoot, it's not a domain expertise. So he said, most of it. No. Oh,

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:19.520
it's, it's, in other words, um, it's not a deep domain expert. Yeah. And, and to be clear, it's,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.720
uh, uh, people go, oh, well, my testing was important. Absolutely. Testing skills. Very important.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:35.600
One thing that really, uh, uh, just kind of pushes my buttons is, uh, I see tweets on this blog posts

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:42.980
on this subject at least once a week. Uh, and I, again, this comes from a history of testing being

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:48.020
very much sort of thought of as sort of this factory process. Like you go to the testers,

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.300
go through it and the bug finders go through it and they find the bugs and they get fixed.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.780
It's a very factories. And there's this, there's this sort of inferiority complex

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.980
almost that comes out of a lot of testers around trying to show that their work is, you know, uh,

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.260
brain engaged and require, and with that, they're absolutely right. It is brain

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:11.060
engaged. And requires critical thinking absolutely does. But the, the, the posts I see almost imply

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:20.400
that, uh, like they, I'm not getting to my point very well, but they'll say some very insightful

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.760
thing, not even insightful, it's very truistic thing about what testing is, which is really

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.440
true for any sort of knowledge work. So I, and I dunno, I guess I shouldn't let it bug me,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:38.480
but yes, the world, we get it testing software testing is not a mindless activity that is like

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:44.240
putting bottle caps on bottles in a factory. Uh, it actually requires thinking as does most

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.360
knowledge work. If you don't know what knowledge work is, go read, uh, uh, like Dan Pink's a

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.120
whole new mind or search on knowledge work on the internet. Cause everything you find there will

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.680
be true of testing as well as anything that isn't working in a factory. Thank you very much

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.280
off of myself. Box just, just, just had to, your, your comment made me think of that. I go, you know

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.360
what? That pisses me off and things that piss me off somehow find their way into

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:12.560
Alan's rants on AB testing. We have talked about this on numerous occasions that we have the

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:19.760
similar opinion that the best testers are ones that have a strong suit in systems thinking.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.760
Yeah. Absolutely. And the big picture, the forest for the trees,

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:29.200
et cetera, et cetera. What with that in mind, like the, the, I don't know that this is what bothers

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:36.320
you, but it does bother me when I see a tester and I expect them to be strong in system thinking,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:44.000
but they can't apply it to the system of testing. It were, where it's this myopic view of

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.120
I have spent the last 15 years convincing myself that this is the single most important job in

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:59.550
on the planet. And I will defend it vigorously, but with out really any sort of consideration

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:06.690
around the alternatives. That goes back to critical thinking. The factory model, you brought it up like

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:15.950
one of the techniques that modern factories do is that they know how to control quality

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:25.940
in line. For example, let's say you have a FUBAR, FUBAR widget, and your job is to apply four

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.820
screws to the FUBAR widget, and then you let it pass that further down into the chain.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:38.500
One of the techniques that one of the factory workers will do is they will actually,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:43.780
the first step is they will take four screws, put it in a little box right in front of them.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:52.300
Okay. And then from that box, they put it, they apply the screws to the FUBAR widget. Okay. Now,

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:59.070
if that FUBAR widget goes down and the person goes put four more screws into their little box and

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:05.460
they realize there is a screw already there, they're going to stop the chain right there and then,

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:13.550
because there's a defect already moving down. Whereas the versus the old model, where

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.920
they don't do that intermediary step, which I argue is the equivalent of TDD,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.860
they don't do that immediate step. They just go screw one, screw, screw. They screw the four

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:31.820
screws directly to the thing without any intermediary step, and they don't have a signal to tell them

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:37.420
that they screwed up. And so that model, you require a QC engineer.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.500
Is that the origin of the term screwed up?

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:41.540
Yes.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.100
We'll call that a-

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.860
I don't actually know.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:49.700
I doubt it is, but for now, today, hey, that's where screwed up came from. I'm forgetting a screw

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.220
on the FUBAR widget factory line.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.100
Yes.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:52.900
All right.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.700
They failed to screw down, therefore it was screwed up.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.170
Oh, God.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.370
All right. I'm going to shut you up. You know why?

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.410
Why, Alan?

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:02.050
You know why?

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.030
Why, Alan?

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:09.780
Mailbag.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.620
All right, Brent. It's time for the mailbag.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.780
Yes. And what's on the mailbag today?

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.660
Hey, I'm going to pronounce the name wrong, but on Twitter, pairs of ABBA,

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.120
pairs.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.520
P-E-R-Z-E, pairs.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.200
I'm going to need him to send a sound byte with his name pronounced correctly. I apologize.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.040
But he had a question about tension metrics. And in one of Brent's blabs,

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.280
maybe it was the last episode? I don't know.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:39.920
I think so.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:45.840
He talked about tension metrics. And the question is, WTF? What the hell are tension metrics?

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.680
So, Brent, WTF, what the hell are tension metrics?

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:58.940
Tension metrics, in essence, are groups of metrics that check and balance each other

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:06.900
with the intent of trang- I'm being too verby- with the intent of-

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.980
Use fewer, smaller words.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.350
You use multiple metrics that work with each other

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:27.150
such that not only do you have metrics that are all intended to say light up green or light up red,

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:33.390
but also to encourage the correct behavior for the entire organization.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:43.680
A common example is several services nowadays are talking about their service reliability.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:53.840
Reliability, in essence, is the rate at which people use it and have a failed transaction.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:01.200
So, reliability typically is measured as successful transactions divided by total transactions.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.120
Remarkably similar to test pass rate from the old days.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:13.420
Now, the problem with just using reliability as a metric is there is a way to game it.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:24.580
You could have, first and foremost, you can have your success transactions

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:30.880
be calculated much more rapidly.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.240
You could over-publicize success.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.440
Or, for example, a common, just a much more simple way of dealing with success transactions

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:53.820
is if you see a transaction that's en route to fail, stop it mid-flight and issue a retry.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.940
Just retrying it until it succeeds.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:05.180
That would allow people, if you had a dev team that implemented a retry facility to that degree,

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.580
the reliability metric would be 100% reliable.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.460
We never fail.

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:19.620
The problem with that one, of course, is the latency perception of your customers is that

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:24.740
okay, when it goes into one of these retry storms, the latency is extremely slow.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:32.080
There is a metric that combines these two, latency and reliability, called availability,

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:38.160
where it's around the time on a transaction that you're spending failing.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.760
An example, if you had success transactions take about 100 milliseconds

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:50.960
and a failure transaction take 10 seconds, this is a real-world example,

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:58.610
and you only fail one at every 10 times, that means you would be spending,

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:08.400
you would have 90% of your time, 90% reliable service, but 7% of your time is spent succeeding.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.590
Now, if you've dealt with any services along those lines, hey, it works, but it takes a half hour,

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:20.190
it doesn't feel like a functioning service.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:36.370
Availability enhances reliability, but you can, again, game it by multiple different facets,

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:43.730
and you create an additional metric that locks down how that prior metric can be gained.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:52.690
So, you could give a team a retry, or the easiest one is every retry you just count as a failure.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:04.320
Anytime a transaction takes a particular too long of a time, you count that as a failure as well,

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:10.420
regardless of whether it was originally tracked as a success or failure.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:18.500
A easier way of processing this, I think, is another example. A lot of teams in the Agile space today

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:30.450
are trying to deploy faster. Now, one of the old-school techniques, particularly in testing,

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:38.500
a lot of the preventative testing blocks us from being able to deploy faster, and as we get more

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:44.260
and more of our test suite and the preventative suite, what I mean is the suite we run before we

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:49.620
check in or release, that makes deployment times slower. In this new world, we don't want

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:57.060
slower deployment times. One of the metrics that I've started flooding on my particular team is

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:03.860
something I call time to block. So, I don't want to validate that the product is working, I want to

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:13.300
validate that the product is crap, which is easier. So, I'm calculating how long it takes for me to

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:27.700
block that release, but I don't want that slowing down my ability to get to stable production code.

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:36.800
So, I have something known as a production cycle time. What that means is, if I'm going to reduce

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.690
the time it takes for me to block, that's likely going to mean I'm going to be focusing on the most

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:52.560
important test cases, and unimportant test cases aren't necessarily going to be run. I'm going to

00:49:52.560 --> 00:50:01.410
release the friction to getting the deployment out. But, my goal is to measure the distance between

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:07.970
when the dev started writing code and when the code was in production and considered stable.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:17.260
So, if I have an easier time getting through the preventative side of the cycle, then I need to

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.580
then account for the fact that I'm likely going to be doing QFEs or things along those lines.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:30.110
And, I need to measure, I need to be able to go which more successful, investing in the

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:36.590
preventative side or investing in flighting and quickly reacting, because my goal is the length

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:46.700
of time it takes to get from initial deployment to when it's stable. And then, the last metric is

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:53.330
the rate at which, oh, that's actually the one I just talked about, that's deployment throughput,

00:50:53.330 --> 00:51:00.270
and then production cycle time is the delta between the stage start time and the product.

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.790
Oh, how long is it?

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:05.550
I think this is what happens when Brent prepares notes for an A-B testing podcast.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.790
We work much better kind of off the cuff.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:14.110
I'm going to close this. So, in a nutshell, and we're out of time, in a nutshell, what you want

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:19.230
to do, attention metric, is you start with what you think is your initial metric. Earlier in the

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:24.910
podcast, Alan was talking about bug counts, right? His initial metric is probably going to be bug

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:30.750
counts per team or something along those lines. Then, you start thinking through, it's like testing,

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:39.150
how can this metric cause the wrong behavior? What behaviors are going to be common with this metric?

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:44.350
Hawthorne's principle, once this is published, it's going to change people's behavior. How is

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:50.770
it going to change it in the way you don't want? What is a new metric to add that also judges

00:51:51.760 --> 00:52:03.890
the system such that there's no way for both of these metrics to pass and not get the behavior you

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:09.520
want? If that's not sufficient, then you add a third or a fourth.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.520
Or tweak the metrics as needed.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.440
If Brent, that chain's going on and on and on and on, you probably just didn't design very

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.920
good measurements in the first place. Once you get to around four,

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.980
then four is sort of my boundary line where I go, okay, we need to rethink of this whole new thing.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:33.060
Eric Ries talks about a topic called the one metric that matters. Once I get to around four

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:38.900
metrics, I rethink those four metrics and try to figure out a way to combine them into a single

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.460
one that gets me the behavior that I want.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.180
All right. Very cool. Thanks, talking about tension metrics, Brent. But you're right, we're

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:49.860
out of time. I got to run to a meeting and we got to get going. I got to pack my stuff.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.740
Okay. All right. I am Alan.

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.340
And I am not.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:00.740
All right. We'll see you next time for episode 26. All right. Bye, guys.
