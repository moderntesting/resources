Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.940
Hey Alan, oh wow that was loud

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.830
So this is the I have a string

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.750
for

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.030
You probably have noticed if you unless this is your first episode

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.030
I have a string of going on three episodes now where I've had something

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.870
Go haywire with the audio quality of this podcast on the positive note

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.710
Like your setup time today is probably the fastest has been since you've got the new gear. Yeah. Well, I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.030
Actually, I'm getting caught up on my sleep. Maybe I don't know anyway today is the day that I hope the audio is good

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030
So if it is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.270
Send me a thumb send me a taco

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.400
you can go to you can go to modern testing org or the podcast hosting this website and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.800
There's a link there to join our slack group

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.110
Yes, and in there you can send tacos that you can send tacos. You can also order stickers. I'm behind the sticker

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.110
Just remember it. I'll send that out today. Sorry. I

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.730
Did know how's the house the house is good. I'm slowly moved in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.470
People I used to have my bookshelves behind me

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.710
I do a lot of video calls and my bookshelves used to be behind me and people were upset the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.750
Bookshelves they do my new office configuration that don't work there

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.630
But I do have the dog behind me now the dog sleeps on the couch behind me all day

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.860
That's pretty our place replace the bookshelves of the dog, which I think is an upgrade

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.900
You still doing mostly work from home?

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.780
Three days a week right now, but two to three days a week

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.560
Actually, it's two days. It was two days this week and I don't plan and it's like oh I'm working from home today

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.900
It's like oh I've had meetings since

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.180
530 a.m. And now it's noon. I'm not gonna bother going into work. I need that window to drive to work

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.120
and sometimes I said meetings back to back and I start early because of Europe and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.280
Sometimes there's some making in but I always go in on

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.720
Tuesdays and Fridays and usually there's one sometimes another day I go in this I work. Yes. I work from the office yesterday

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.900
Yeah, I got a pretty sweet home office gig at home, but I find

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.900
That I can't get work done

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.380
Number one

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.880
I'm easily distractible in the first place

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.900
Number two there are a lot of distractions at home

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.630
Yeah, it took me a while. I think it took me a long time of having days working from get used to it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.470
Definitely in the new house. I have a new

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.410
An elevated compared to my old house level of production. I'm not sure why I'm getting a lot more done there

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.590
especially when the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.550
Media room as we call it with the TV of my Xbox literally across the hall from my home office and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040
Borderlands 3 is begging me to come play

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.240
Yeah, I haven't I haven't even I haven't I so far I have not played Borderlands

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.360
Dear before like six or seven at night. So and I have to say

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.010
The game is a little buggy. I haven't even I haven't even downloaded it

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.050
It's like the first sort of noticeably buggy game I played and I've had since I've started playing it a week or so ago

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.310
It's had I feel like a dozen little updates. So it is getting better. I haven't even launched

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.030
X

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.310
Hell, I haven't even gone into my media room in about a month. Yeah, we want to go dust it. Okay

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.710
Anything interesting last thing from my end is

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.990
still

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.990
We've wrapped up now. I've the modern testing course on ministry of test

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.830
It'll be another few weeks to a month before it appears on the dojo

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.390
Brent was marveling over my dojo instructor sticker on my laptop. Oh, there you go. So that's why I have that

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.030
So excited about that anything with you before we get started

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.440
Took advantage of

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640
The

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.360
Appliance sales that happens on the last 3d weekend I can I can never remember if it's Memorial or Labor Day

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.480
Oh, would you buy I bought a

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.840
killer

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.280
Samsung

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.110
new stove a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.460
New Samsung refrigerator as well as a new Bosch dishwasher

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.820
Oh

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.920
We have a Bosch dishwasher and I have and and this is the appliance portion of the a Bt

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.960
Because now I have opinion. So which boss did you get?

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.090
The expensive one. I don't right we have an expensive Bosch in our new house. It's nice. It's silent 44 decibels

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:32.610
But it is nothing compared is a downgrade from the melee we had in our old house. Oh, sorry. You should have moved it

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.490
I I thought about I I thought about going back to get it

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.490
We and I took advantage of a appliance sale a while back I have become

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.250
Maybe I'm not sure at what stage of having teenagers has happened probably to everyone

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.570
But I have become one of those people that has a second refrigerator in their garage. Oh

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.780
I've been in that place since

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.440
In that place since I had a you know shortly after I purchased a house

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.700
Yeah, it is great. It is actually it's not even full but it's good just to have it

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.500
But the drama this time around is I for for a period of an hour. I had three

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:22.940
But I sweet talked the guys who delivered the last refrigerator to take the the lesser of the three away

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.620
So I didn't have to pay, you know

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.810
some random person to

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.530
Either two hundred dollars if you pay some random person to come and pick it up

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.690
They're gonna charge you an arm and a leg these guys did it for free

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.040
My reef my raising a refrigerator. Yeah

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.660
So is it the time where you can knock on the outside shows to us inside?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.960
It's gonna knock on the outside. I can show you on the inside of my refrigerator

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.580
right now

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:02.030
The internet oh, yeah, cuz I put my washer and dryer my new washer and dryer on on our internet a few weeks ago

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.030
So it can tell me what loads are done

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:11.590
Yeah, it's weird and it's it's kind of like high-tech meets old people because we're talking about appliances here on a yeah

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.930
I there you can organize that a lot better. Oh, and here's the thing. Here's one thing that's cool

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.930
Doesn't really work well for the podcast

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.510
But for say like this thing. Yes this thing. Oh

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Damn it. I can't do it on this one

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.360
Brent's pointing at his phone

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.130
All right. I sought to work through it. But there is a there is one of these damn apps a lot

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.470
allows me to bring crosshairs and say that thing I

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.720
either needed order a new one of these or

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.340
that one expires in end days or

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.610
All sorts of things this hooks up to to Google home

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.910
And then once you get up to Google home, obviously you can use

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.040
IFFT or

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.840
FTT or my FTT is the property. Yeah that one or Zapier. We're not we're not married either

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.440
in recently I dropped about

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.080
$400 on

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.080
Phillips hue

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.080
lighting for the media room

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.150
That you haven't been in in a month that I yeah, but

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.590
Literally, I I

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.310
Finished that purchase and installed it all like a week before

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.350
School started that's the main reason why I haven't got a mini room. I don't have the time

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:43.390
But at first when I thought I'm like why why everyone into this Phillips hue thing it's who cares

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.800
Hey, oh, it's cool

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.510
Alright, when you hook it up. Yeah, yeah to Xbox streaming and you can have whatever is on your Xbox

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.830
Have your room match the colors

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:04.140
It's cool when you're playing minecraft and you go underwater. The whole room is underwater. Not just the screen. Yeah

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:13.020
That may happen. I'm digging. I don't play a lot of minecraft, but whatever I'm digging I'm digging the IOT world

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.820
Okay, you need IPV6 for your house to get enough personal addresses through stuff

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.440
Just saying yeah, not yet. Yeah, so should we have something about?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.560
Oh

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.930
Software, I guess we kind of a software. How about we talk about that not yet. So the other we're not ready

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.850
Okay mesh network. Do you have was pressing 30 seconds 30 seconds faster?

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.370
Come on you guys get there

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:45.910
Realize that I have gone through and in the last two months. I have seriously upgraded

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:51.760
The electronics of my house so mesh networking mesh network. Do you have one of those course? Okay?

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.420
Which one do you have Evo? Okay, I have the deco

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.840
and

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.160
OMG

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.640
Those things are awesome. Yes. All right now I'm done

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:11.040
Yeah, so and I thought I would hate like I've had the traditional router forever where I can go in and control and tweak everything

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.240
And on my deco the TP link echo for those of you looking it up

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.880
Just get an app with a handful of those settings, but actually it's everything I need to do

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.280
I can assign static IPs. I can it has some built-in stuff so I can I use the parental controls

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.600
Mm-hmm, that shut off my kids internet at a particular time

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.900
Question I get at least once a week dad. Can I have 15 more minutes of internet? I need to do some work

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.920
Oh really? What is it you need to do?

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.820
Research what research video

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.060
Good night. Good night

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.820
Beat it kid. Oh

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.500
Yeah, so

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.780
Been there done that we should have been there done

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.220
We have an all tangent episode once where we never actually got to anything, but that's not today. No, don't shut it off

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:08.360
Yeah, we have things I might have I might have the only episode in the last three months where there's not awful sound

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.640
Yeah, the the parental controls

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:21.110
So my daughter doesn't have anything I'm worried about yet and she's still too young my oldest

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.430
Has finally gotten through the hump

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.730
but there was times where

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.990
Not only was the internet

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.630
I

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.270
Did so many things number one?

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:44.580
Most most of the wireless routers offer the ability to do a guest network. Okay, I

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.950
I

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.910
Dedicated the guest network to him

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.710
gave a separate

00:11:54.170 --> 00:12:01.170
Account and it's because my router at that time allowed me to remotely turn off and on the guest network

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:09.530
So anytime my wife sent me a text going oh my god, this kid's driving me nuts. My response was off

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.880
And

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.680
But that kid is a smart kid

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.640
and

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:24.880
And he's kind of has a hacker mentality like his dad and he'll find a way to work around it. So it

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.850
at

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:33.690
Some point in time I was creating mechanisms and chasing. Okay. How is he connecting the internet this time?

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.450
Okay, that one's gone. How about this time? Okay, that one's gone. How about this?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.050
Yeah, but that's over

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.710
Okay, cool

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.220
So is this an all-male bank show?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.000
Yeah, no, we just spent half hour doing tendons

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.960
By the time I edit it, it'll only be 10 minutes. Yeah. Yeah

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.060
Okay, should we have some mailbag questions? Is that correct? We do

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.730
I'll start while Brett looks up his phone. No, I got it. Oh, you got it. Okay. Go ahead

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.090
One of our listeners on the slack channel asked

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.440
This is kind of connected to a question. I wanted to ask

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.840
Oh, yeah out of context. I think Alan's gonna bring us bring the context in

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.840
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just bored. I'm playing some video games over here. Let me know you know

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.800
This was the okay. Go on from what brain was saying

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.640
I got the impression that all Microsoft teams to move moved to the unified engineering work model

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.460
But from what I hear not you

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.560
Yeah, not true

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.960
him

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.120
We've talked about this before we have yeah

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:54.480
But what I hear from my friends working in Microsoft in Prague that developer tester model is still there and they are

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.320
Even unaware that in USA you work differently

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.480
When I pointed them to your article on the subject. It was the first time they had learned about it

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:10.310
So my question is is what is the adoption rate of unified engineering model in Microsoft?

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:18.070
Well, if you go by and this is by three coming up on three-year-old data if you go by address book information, it's 100%

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.010
Well, no, I'm not percent what I what I what I left

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.130
if you looked in the

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.170
They ever replace head tracks anything better

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.860
So you looked in the the employee tracking the employee HR system

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:40.040
There were I think I saw two or three people with the the word test in their title. Mm-hmm

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.960
out of

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.880
at the time

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.880
25,000 30,000 engineers care member here here in Redmond

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.880
The only teams that I know of that still have a

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.400
QA

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.790
element

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:04.030
Similar to what we would have done in the traditional world are those in the hardware space

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.990
and what a little different yes, and what they're validating is

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.310
essentially the

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.170
That the hardware that we were just delivered

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.400
is

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.760
Meeting standards before we start applying but but but but but let me let you all in on a little secret

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.280
Facebook even years before Microsoft made this move or that we don't have testers were able to test our own stuff and

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.560
Facebook like Microsoft

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.960
employees a whole lot of

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.960
Contract testers and not full-time in the address book, but there are

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760
thousands and thousands of

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.120
testers dedicated to testing Microsoft products paid as contract employees not as full-time employees

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.600
Yes, but the unified

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.400
engineering adoption and again, I'll say in in in Redmond

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:09.020
By payroll cost by headcount by any of those measures is not only the dominant situation

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.220
It is by far the dominant situation. Yeah, it's odd to me

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:20.360
I'm not sure about the teams in Prague or I'm not sure how they're set up or how they could be

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.560
So separated they would not have heard of this before. It seems weird

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:31.440
Here I think the three years time difference has made you forget one of the more common things

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.630
that is rampant in Microsoft and that is not invented here and

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.870
one of the

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.870
easiest ways to

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.150
To continue to support a culture of not invented here is

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.300
To make sure you don't talk to any other team

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:59.690
True, but those satellite teams tend to work with other teams like my like when I was on teams

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.850
It had a chunk of the team based in Prague

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:11.470
Did they yep? Okay, cuz I was about to say I don't even I didn't even know we had a development sub in Prague

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:16.910
This leads into I think I don't know this shows up in the mailbag or not

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:22.230
This leads into a video that came out in the last couple of weeks by a youtuber

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.870
slash

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:30.630
Former Microsoft employer named barnacles. That's not his real name. I don't know what his real name doesn't matter

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.270
Where and Brett hasn't watched the video

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.790
I watched it because I had a bunch of people point me to and say Alan

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:43.630
What do you think of this and the gist of the article is this guy is a pretty good speaker

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.230
yeah, he has a reasonable following on YouTube and

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.750
he's

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.910
as I mentioned former Microsoft tester on the Windows team and

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.580
his basic premise is

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.560
Windows 10

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.800
These is getting buggier and buggier and every release is like we're stepping over a

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.640
minefield of bugs and

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.240
this is because Microsoft laid off all their testers for Windows and

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.420
they should hire a test team back to bring back quality and

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.940
One of those statements is true and two of those statements are false

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.920
I would say one is half true. Maybe one is half true

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.040
Well, and and even in its explanation of the and it's hard because I've been away for a while

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.040
So I have to make stuff up

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.140
Let's kind of go through that I can bring I can bring in some details to catch you up

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.380
You'll feel like you've watched the video. So let's start with the first question

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.350
And this has been a great one to have Steve Rowe here, but I think you would have hand waved a little bit

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.350
I don't know Steve. Let us know chime in on slack

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.310
is

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.310
Windows 10

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:58.320
Buggier is it does it have a bug or a quality problem and you don't work on Windows?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.080
I know you probably don't want to answer in case any hi in case soft you listen to our podcast, right?

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.540
So I don't know the answer to that question

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.240
Steve Rowe definitely

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.980
would

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.180
And again, I'm not certain that he would

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:21.420
share it. I do think that that there is a

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.620
So I mentioned half I do think it's a half truth, right so

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.500
It did absolutely start when Microsoft got rid of their testers

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.590
What that organization did not do? Oh

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:46.710
Did you want to leave there? No, no, no, I know I know where you're going. Okay, you went right where I thought you would which is great, right?

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.850
What they did not do is something that Alan and I have

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.990
Talked about a lot of times Alan said told or shared this guidance

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.590
I don't know 30,000 times on stage

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.990
what the

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.990
You know the underwear gnomes

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.390
No, have you heard of the underwear? No, okay

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.090
so South Park

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:24.230
They they have these characters called the underwear gnomes and the problem that the underwear gnomes have

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:32.490
Is everyone goes to Amazon and others to get their shoes so they don't need gnomes to make magical shoes anymore

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:38.130
So they realized that they need to come up with a new business proposition

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.690
Okay. Now what they learned is

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.920
They have a three-step plan

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:53.150
Okay, and they had an idea and the first step is they're gonna go steal everyone's underwear

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.900
Okay, and they have the last step of the plan

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.170
Massive profit, so they're gonna start by stealing everyone's underwear

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.450
And that's gonna deliver massive profit now. The problem is

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:15.060
They don't know what step two is and even on their advertising the step two is a question mark

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:21.180
but this is actually a very good analogy it is metaphor go on but

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.960
Even without knowing what step two is that they have a clear step one

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.800
So they can start executing that while you know the the brain ear gnomes I guess figure out

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.770
What step two is that connects the dots between ceiling underwear and massive profit?

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.330
to me I

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.110
Use the underwear gnome metaphor a lot

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.880
It's not just at Microsoft

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.740
Microsoft because it's a pattern of behavior I see all of the time

00:21:54.010 --> 00:22:01.530
It's just a huge amount of confidence that oh, yeah once we start this we'll figure out a way to connect the dots to to the goal

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.040
Some of those situations in fact succeed

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.150
Some of those situations don't and

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:19.150
And I would say with because I was there for the transition in Windows and I want to correct a bunch of

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.470
misstatements in the video

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:28.670
I'm sure we'll have a fraction of the listeners a tiny fraction of the listeners is this podcast has have watched the video but

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.390
so what I saw being on the front lines as transition to Windows was

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.590
One they did not lay off all the testers they

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.550
There was a time when they merged Xbox Windows phone and Windows into one big org

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.550
And there was some redundant people that were laid off

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.190
And there's some good people laid off there. I I

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.110
Fully on board that did out lay off the whole testing

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.830
but what they did was took the whole test team and said you're the data and

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.790
Quality team or something they put people into new rules or your developers

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.310
so they dissolved the testing more than laid them all off and then

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:07.250
The sort of the question mark happened and you could say there's a strategy that and I kept on going back and forth between thinking

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.420
there's no plan here big just a question mark and

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:18.620
maybe there's just letting a thousand flowers bloom and this is where I saw to his credit Steve Rowe just latch on to data science and

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.620
then go from someone who was

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.660
Definitely where there was a point in time where I think I knew more

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.220
About data science and Steve Rowe it lasted about a minute

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.060
And then he got excited about it, and then now is full-on like figured out how to make this work

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.850
so the thousand flowers blooming thing happened, but I feel like

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:43.130
There was a plan missing there as well, so I'm not sure quite the balance there, but anyway go on

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:47.490
Oh, so what I saw what I saw over and over again at Microsoft at that time

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.740
was

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.430
You could completely remove the test team

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.780
But then there was a complete assumption

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.620
well, then of course dev is gonna do the right thing and pick up the slack and

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.500
That was the assumption that I saw over and over again as

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.700
false

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.980
because

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:19.140
As many people want to call it a point point out when we bring up MT

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:26.500
But Alan and Bryn dev doesn't want a test. Yeah, that is absolutely true and

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:32.270
That is why we pulled in principle seven as part of MT is

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.310
It's the right thing for the business

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.110
We need to figure out strategies

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.750
to to succeed

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.070
Even though they don't want to

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:50.780
So I've yes, and now I want to get into the points of the barnacles video

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.020
Which are I hope go not only disagree with butter, but I flat out wrong

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.100
So I think he does have an argument that

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:04.100
There is more buggy behavior in the recent builds of Windows than maybe they were in the past. I

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.880
Disagree completely that having bringing back a test team to be test buddies

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.900
Is the right way to do it? In fact, let me talk about a few things. He says from my memory, which as no is bad

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.570
He said believe it or not

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:26.410
Testing needs to be there to be the gatekeepers. In fact, we called ourselves that we were the gatekeepers of quality

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.410
Oh my god, that triggered you

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.050
That's pretty much that might be a slight paraphrase pretty much

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.730
He did say we were called the gate we called ourselves the gatekeepers that well, that's the wrong way to do it

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.930
so he went off a few different times on dump files and and

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:49.740
I feel like he didn't understand them completely but he talked eloquently about them

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:55.420
But he said we get these mini dumps which we do from crashes and they don't have all the information

00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:01.180
So what I do is a tester is I would look at the mini dump and I would debug it and make sure I figured

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.860
I'd make sure I get the developer at all the information they needed to figure out the right way to fix the bug and

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:12.800
They need someone to do that and I'm thinking do you did they also need someone to bring them their coffee in the morning

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.580
And lunch in the afternoon

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:19.140
It's like why are they unable to do that? He went off

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:26.330
for a while on these this codependency we've talked about how but it's weird because

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:31.010
Is it centering for me because these things we talked about as being inefficient?

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.850
he saw as

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:41.450
Necessary in order to generate quality and I use the word generate there purposely because it's really a big story about how

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:48.530
This video still with things about how the test team is necessary in order to test quality into developers crappy code

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.810
That was essentially his

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.810
So the story went from Windows 10 is buggy

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.580
The right way to do that is to have a bunch of people who do developers work for them

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.980
So it's less buggy. He even brought back the fact of you to bring back all the UI automation that

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.580
Windows 10 had

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.100
It's really like that and

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:19.180
And it's the one of these things like let's harken back to the old days when things were much simpler and easier

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:26.140
and so the solution to if a new problem pops up because of moving forward the answer is

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.390
Not always or rarely I wouldn't say never

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.890
Rarely to move backward if I deploy a bug to production

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.230
Yes

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.630
I want to roll back if I make a process change if I make a bet on doing things

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:46.910
Differently because I think it'll help my business proud principal one our priorities for the business and I screw it up

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.310
I may want to fix forward versus roll back and in this case

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:58.490
Yeah, I'm as you can tell I am one million percent against the idea that

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.270
Hiring a test team is the right way to

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.860
Fix any perceived or real bugs in Windows quality

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.780
Now and so in generic advice, right is

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.430
if

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.820
You realize you pulled the trigger too soon, right?

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:24.340
And and I'm not saying if Windows did or did not but there are multiple teams that I have observed

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.900
And were involved in where I felt oh

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.780
That team absolutely pulled the trigger too soon

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.090
Sure. Do you solve?

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.250
critical quality

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.650
Issues with the dollar sign

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.470
absolutely

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:49.550
Were I in a strategic role on those teams? Sure. I would go I would spend

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.950
The necessary money on vendor dollars to bring things up to speed

00:28:55.550 --> 00:29:00.470
But now without a plan that was proactively communicated

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:06.510
around when these guys are going away and my expectations of the of

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:10.530
The people who will be left behind

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.400
See you would start with why I?

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:21.560
Absolutely. Yeah, and that's that's super important organizational change and I and that I don't want to I I don't want to be yet another

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.960
Microsoft employee harping on why Microsoft sucks and

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.160
You do that well already

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.680
I do want to mention that the issues with updating from build to build on

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.280
Windows are what drove me away from using Windows

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.880
Sure. So it there are issues there

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:48.670
And I think the end in my experience was you know being at Microsoft my bills were updated much more often

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.150
my experience was that

00:29:51.770 --> 00:30:01.400
It's been over a year since I've used Windows, but my personal experience was yes quality did go down. I have I

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.840
have similar

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.920
similar

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.670
complaints on a broad aspect

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.630
I have no proof of this

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:23.870
But I do except for this is the thing that drives me the most nuts nowadays and I do feel like

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.950
UI design has taken a hit

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.420
right at the

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.930
Teams your your old product. Yep. Okay, it does weird things

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.490
with microphones

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:47.350
Like it didn't just pick up the default OS microphone

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.520
And apparently the only time I can go and change the microphone is when I'm on a call

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.160
And I'm like what the hell?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.160
Right in you it has a settings button and

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.670
That you go to that one you click the settings button and it takes you to oh

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.390
Here's a whole bunch of apps you can install for teams. I'm like

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.020
Why is that not a downloads apps button?

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.140
How is that settings?

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.640
No, where do I change the goddamn microphone for this product?

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:30.120
The because I happen to have one of I got a new computer and the new computer

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:39.080
Is a desktop, but it's I don't know why companies still build these but it's one where the desktop has an integrated microphone

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:45.380
Who the hell uses that what the hell who the hell uses that nobody? No, no, buddy

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.600
That well, let me tell you the challenges

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.360
Of course that I guess they want to add it because it's ten cents

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.960
But I hate to do this in the context this conversation

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:04.640
But the integrated microphone on my MacBook is actually very very good. I use the one

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.200
shocking

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.760
Very shocking. It's the the MacBook microphones are very very good. I have a Lenovo

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.880
And I do conference calls and I'd say no one complains

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.520
Yeah

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.120
In fact if you I was on the test and code podcast maybe three months ago

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.560
Yep, if you listen to that my entire audio is recorded off of my MacBook microphone

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.600
Yeah, so just saying anyway go on

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.130
Where were we when it occurred and

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.080
Like I don't know when that article came out

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:50.420
The the one with the video that you're talking about. Oh just within the last few weeks. Yeah, okay

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.800
So that would be the latest example

00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:02.160
When they were going through the transition I heard all sorts of dev and testers fighting it

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:09.860
Three years later I'm aware of devs devs coming to insane we need to do this

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.090
And I would say

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.330
to

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:19.230
Microsoft's credit most of those teams those requests have been denied

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:32.050
In in steel to bring back testers, yeah, okay, and I had a good finish then I want to build on that story the

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.290
Steve would do would do a much more detailed

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.340
job I

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.220
Guess the nice thing though is the fact that you and I are not on the teams

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.140
And don't know much about it except for the people we talked to it

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.660
Reduces our risk of or at least my risk of exposing an NDA

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.620
right and and to be fair an operating system is very complex and

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.750
It's the hardware ecosystem the fact that that PCs can contain a

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:09.270
Virtually infinite or combinatorial infinite number of

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:13.410
Combination of devices makes things difficult. I know how I said that right but

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:17.750
And if you look at Microsoft's main customers, which are corporations

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:23.370
They tend to buy a lot of the same PCs for all their employees. They get a much higher success rate

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:27.860
It's I think it's tough on the home user though. Well, and the other thing so I

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.290
Will say I am

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.650
Pro Satya I

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:39.490
Very say I'm too. I'm very supportive of the direction. I like I didn't leave because of him. I

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.960
Like that. He is taking a proactive

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.120
stance I felt

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.320
Bomber spent most of his time trying to defend a position and

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.980
When you when you need do that

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.830
It

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:06.270
Makes it just so much easier for a small upstart to come from nowhere and take your market, right?

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.530
I

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.530
Told this story before

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.850
Ten years ago or so. I was having discussions with a manager of mine and

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.010
They were like, oh

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.130
We own the OS market and we will forever

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.450
because we have

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:29.650
18 quadrillion lines of code and it is so complex and

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:37.220
Company like Android OS is my favorite example here. It came from nowhere

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.580
to dominance and it's because of

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.980
They took a service service mentality to deploy it

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.660
so

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.020
Barna Cleese or whatever the guy's name is

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:56.010
If we want to go back in time, there is one point in time where I'll agree

00:35:56.010 --> 00:36:02.860
If we're gonna go back in time, we need to go back in the time before services existed and

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:11.490
Never create service and never create services and then everything he's saying is correct. But until then there's going to be

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.330
companies

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:19.110
Like that that were that that approaches ludicrous so I have two stories to tell

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.110
One is I was in a

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
some leadership training at Microsoft

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.940
15 years ago and there was a since retired air quote retired VP of

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.460
In I think he was in networking

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.980
But he was talking about this same thing as OS dominance and dad

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.740
I did it up and this is just the time the Chromebook was announced but not out yet

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.060
But I asked I said my question was pretty much along the lines of

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.220
The way I work today given the fact that

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:55.170
An information worker can work largely in a browser all day long

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.370
Do you see a need for Microsoft to compete with a lighter weight OS that?

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:09.010
Focuses on the browser experience basically I said should we have a Chrome should we have a Chrome OS competitor and his answer was

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:16.230
It's like the spinal tap answer, but our apps go to 11 says but why would you want that when you couldn't have windows and play games, too?

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:22.840
So that's not the point and they just kind of double down on well, I can play games in the browser

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:29.680
His whole line of questioning this whole line of answers to me were but we can do more with Windows

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.840
Yes, it's true, but you can

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:39.360
When you're trying to increase market share you have two options you can go after someone else's market share or

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.360
Like the smart people do go grab market share that hasn't been grabbed yet

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.750
Or create a new market or create a new market. Yes, which is kind of the same thing

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:55.250
the the other so that that happened that was yet another brick in the wall of my

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.230
my long exit

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:03.670
But the interesting story is now I don't fast-forward this to last week

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:11.180
When I had a conversation, maybe it was this Monday. I had a conversation with someone on my in my org

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.970
at Unity

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.140
Where we have I

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.580
Wouldn't call him a tester

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:25.920
I have someone who is a sort of a test coach testing quality coach for an entire half of the team

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.480
I think I want to hire someone else to do the other half of the team

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.360
I think it actually works out really well to have someone float and help and coach and not do all the work

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.340
And I think that's a right way. I think it's like it aligns MT very well

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.120
I need that coach there

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:44.720
But anyway, they said their question was I think we need to hire a test team and they thought I would be oh great

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.800
I can build my empire and hire testers and I told them why they were wrong

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:56.920
They said but but but but but and which is gonna dovetail into our next question a little bit maybe

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:05.480
But my answer the answer was no and then it was no and they said but but what about we have to

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.530
For this particular part. We need to test across

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:15.230
60 different phones and this and I said great

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.900
We have

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.140
Bit bar we can use for that. It goes no, no, no we can use for something. Okay. Okay

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.340
There's a little bit of stuff

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.180
We need to spot check on each of the phones and make sure things we have to do we need eyeballs on it

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:32.580
I'm not against eyeball testing and not I'm not in the automate everything camp. So it's okay. Cool. Cool

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:40.880
That's the perfect thing to hire out. I would not hire a test team a full-time tester to come in and check

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.400
the not to

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.400
degrade

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.960
Offshore teams or even even near store teams that do this manual verification

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:57.400
I would even give them narratives and do some exploratory testing for us, but I would definitely contract that workout and

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.680
They didn't once I kind of explained that view

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.400
there was

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:10.560
Right now this is just Monday. There's the the reaction was somewhere between yeah, of course you write Alan and and

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.640
Well, let me ponder that a little bit. They're sort of thinking about that

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:20.520
I think that makes sense to them. But anyway, that just happened. So I am NOT hiring a test team

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.720
However, I'll probably hire one kind of senior coachable tester in San Francisco. Hey three

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.540
At some point in the next few months. But anyway

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.480
Did you have more on barnacles? Did you want to dovetail this into the next mail bed question?

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.120
Yeah, look we can we can go in the next mail

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.320
Like and I if I remember I'll link the video it should be easy to find

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.720
I think it was shared a whole bunch of times. He makes a joke about the video going viral

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.720
I think it actually did sort of go viral

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.360
But

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.360
Yeah, it's worth checking out

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.280
Only to get your own only to build your own opinion versus the one I've created for either

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.750
It it is human nature

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.870
to resist

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.470
change

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:13.400
The the thing like as you talked about right a long term

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.760
long term

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.000
I mean, I'm this is not the prediction episode

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.400
No that comes up in another few months, but as you talked about right

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.170
You can do a lot with just the browser alone

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:36.210
Will there be a concept of a universal cloud OS?

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:42.920
Where maybe whatever limitations browsers have get fixed

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:48.490
The cloud is growing the cloud is not gonna go away and

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.650
Well what we're observing is

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.250
What people want is compute?

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:06.360
Not anything underneath it. Why do I even need to know there is hardware in today's world?

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.760
Right in what we're finding is is that so you can play games friends

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:19.540
I don't need to know that so it for those who have studied object oriented design

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.860
Right what we're seeing is is

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.390
Encapsulation even in the compute space and it continues to grow right

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.090
Microservices everywhere is going to be a thing that happens

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:41.090
Right, and then you hook that up to IOT or right? I am more worried about

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:48.110
Things just magically happen and no one knows why anymore

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.920
because they we

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.560
Humans just don't have the ability to pay that much attention to the complexity

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:03.560
And if we have individual teams deploying these small little widgets and and we have millions of teams and millions of widgets

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:09.670
Right it just to me feels like it gets a little bit closer to

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:14.850
Magic I was talking with my daughter just yesterday and

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.810
She's super excited about her having her phone

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:24.610
And she was asking about laptops and phones and right now Samsung 10 are actually

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:30.350
They're making a statement that their phones can be used

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.280
in a place of a laptop and viable a

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.410
Make a

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.450
phone with a terabyte of storage

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.530
I'll essentially

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:43.570
in memory

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:48.940
Right, that's I mean if you can deal with the the small form factor

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.860
You're good to go. Yeah, and interesting

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:57.460
I do want to get to the next question in our last 10 minutes or so here, but I built a new

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.420
home computer maybe coming up on three years right when I left Microsoft and

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.490
on your recommendation I got

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:10.670
The what do they call the m1 m2 m2 drive? Isn't that thing cool? It's cool

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.150
I've also got an SSD. I figured okay, I should I feel like I need a gig of

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.520
Storage a gig a terabyte. Thanks

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.520
512 m2 and a 512

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.680
SSD I

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.920
Forget I have the SSD because the 512 m2 is more than enough

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.920
I just don't have enough stuff that I store and this is I started syncing my Google drives

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:46.160
To my box as well. I just don't store that much stuff on I don't keep them any artifacts locally

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.570
Right because you have it, you know used to be

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.890
You're adding

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.570
You have your computer for a year you add another hard drive to it

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:02.170
You keep on adding storage till you have this massive storage and I remember doing this for years

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:06.610
I just don't need as much anymore. The only reason why I have

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.350
storage on my box at home because I do the same thing I'm like

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:15.580
Hey, if I just load it up to to one drive

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:19.870
I have a lot more confidence

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.860
that

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:27.020
That's gonna be protected and secured and backed up than I do if I did it manually

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:32.460
Yeah, because I hate doing it and I'm lazy. Yeah, I have rule of three for backups. So we have a

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:38.020
server at home a NAS server which is backed up continuously to

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:44.210
Actually Amazon I pay for carbonate

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:48.950
so Amazon is Prime members at 60 bucks a year for a terabyte and that's

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.350
I say just under that because photos are free

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:57.550
Then first stuff I have my entire CD collection over CDs

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:03.510
Ripped to flak which is lossless audio and that's all backed up to Glacier storage. I pay a dollar a month for that

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:06.050
dollar 50 maybe

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:10.730
Yeah, it's just there for like I don't want to re-rip them all again, but I want so it's I spend

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:19.960
$15 a year just to make sure never have to re-rip my entire CD collection. So I have about

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:27.220
Three thousand CDs in boxes sitting underneath my bed and I have

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.700
No idea what I'm gonna do with these things. Yeah, I mean

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:36.830
The hundred dollar a year Spotify subscription. I'm good. Yeah, it is

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:44.330
Shall we call not ripping these things I'm not playing them. I don't know what to do

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:50.280
All right. We'll do go to the next time. So I do want to get into the second question. Let's do it briefly here

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.960
So can you read the question?

00:46:53.480 --> 00:47:00.160
The questions long we have 10 minutes. I'll summarize it. That's that's what I hoped. Okay, can you summarize the question? I meant to say hi

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.040
Alan. Hey, how's it going? I am fine. Thank you. I

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:13.730
Work for a QA agency. I'm all aboard on MT

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:19.240
But ultimately I go to my clients and they say that's great

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.360
Here's a bunch of test cases. Please go automate them

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.120
So the question is is how do I apply MT in that scenario?

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:35.890
That's an excellent question. It is so anyway, we're out of time

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:44.530
It'll generate more questions we can talk about yeah, no, let's let's do it. I'm kidding

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:48.730
Yeah, no, I think it's it's tough because you're getting paid

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.790
In a situation like that you're getting paid to do what?

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:57.510
The customer wants you to do if they tell you that you need your job is to go

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:02.010
Clean their bathroom. I guess you do it or you quit the same thing with

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:07.730
Please run all these test cases reminds me again going back to my first day at Microsoft when

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:12.570
My manager gave me an Excel spreadsheet full of these UI test case these test cases

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.650
I said great when you need these automated because oh, no, we don't have time to automate

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.290
You just need to run these every day. So I automated them anyway

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:25.120
My first act of defiance at Microsoft took about two days and I never stopped but in this situation

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.280
I think it's tough because on one hand

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:34.040
There's what the customer wants versus what they need and obviously you can't go in there and say no

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.440
I'm not gonna run your test cases. I'm going to transform your organization into the 21st century

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.440
That's not what they want to hear

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:48.230
But I would say and I sure you have some ideas as well is sure you go you go do that testing

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:51.310
But you start doing some things that enable

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:57.350
The growth of the quality culture and maybe that may be quality culture is where you start with principle

00:48:57.350 --> 00:49:02.310
Number four is where you start in a row click. This is you do the testing but you talk when you go

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:10.670
Deliver the bug to the developer as barnaclay's is talking about as with some huge awesome thing

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.070
You have a conversation about so cool. Do you want to?

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:20.470
Do you want to pair up on fixing it? Do you want to pair up on testing it when you have the fix ready?

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.630
Can we talk about how we could have prevented this? What do you think we should do differently?

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.510
Think we could add tools and see I should we have a CI system?

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:33.870
That'll make my job easier because then you guys would find these bugs what test Oh my favorite question ask the developers

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:40.420
When they say like you please test this for me if they were to say that to me, they're not that stupid. I would say

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:47.360
What tests have you already run and just to get those conversations going say no, it's your job

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.880
Well, actually no, my job is different. I would say it's even as a QA agency is look I

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.120
Can't come in here and find all your bugs for you. It's not gonna scale that way

00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:02.020
I'm gonna find the bugs that you can't find. So let's look at this as a bandpass filter

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:06.360
So there's a bunch of bugs that you are more suitable and more able to find

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.080
I'm not gonna be your safety net. I'm not gonna be your

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.040
It's we're gonna be more efficient. We're gonna have a better relationship

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:18.080
We're gonna deliver higher quality software together if you find the bugs that you're capable of finding and over time as we work together

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.440
You're gonna get better at that

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.240
But for now

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:25.640
Let's talk about what testing you're going to do and then I can figure out how to build on that and make sure we deliver

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:29.600
A high quality product together. I would have a conversation kind of like that and see

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.620
Where that builds to and obviously it's gonna go in one of ten thousand different directions

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:38.160
it is interesting given like the

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.760
They're in a contract position

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.550
but

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:43.870
the

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:49.190
Specific scenario I think is actually something we spent a good amount of time in the same episode talking about

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:52.830
in cases of crises, that's that's

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.870
appropriate so

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.270
this particular person said

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:01.250
Their scenario. I don't know if this is real or just

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.940
Hypothetical but their scenario was

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.660
Their company or him were being hired

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.530
To convert manual test cases to automate

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:19.470
All right, that is one of the levels of hell I think

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.400
It is

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.390
But let's let's do it this way

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.620
startup company

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:36.260
Right it the the the role of a startup is to find a stable business plan before the money runs out

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.530
Right and so one of the first things

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:44.850
Why I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but one of the first things that's going to be abandoned in

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.850
In a situation like that if you're out of time

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:54.400
You're gonna go the quick path. You're not gonna not gonna invest in automating the test cases. You'll run them

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:57.290
But you're not going to invest in automating them

00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:59.850
the

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.690
and again

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.690
Probably the wrong thing to do

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.850
But it seems like a time-saving cost at that moment

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:17.010
And it's primarily because people don't really pay attention to all the missed bugs that they're now having to fund

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:19.570
instead of writing new features I

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:27.200
Am perfectly okay that once you realize you have that as technical debt and that is actually bottle necking you

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.840
I'm perfectly okay spending money to buy it down

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:37.100
There's a technique to I mean my read my my

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:44.410
Hell reactions because not all air quote manual tests can be air quote automated

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.640
That's it's a different is a test design problem

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.120
There may be a bunch of tests set. Yes, we could automate these

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.340
There may be a bunch of tests like no actually it makes sense to have eyeballs on these

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.160
we should not we should make sure we just do a little sanity walkthrough or

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.480
Realize it's never going to break and not run those tests at all

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.880
And there's another group of tests like maybe we need just write a diagnostic tool that will tell us what's going on

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.240
that would highlight issues that happen like this, but take a list of

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:22.080
Test cases that are scripted and to automate them is I think more often than not a fool's errand

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.040
Here's or at least approached blindly. Here's what I would do

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:31.820
Here's my answer to that question in what I would do in that person's shoes and

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.990
Generalizing what you just said, okay?

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:43.440
So I'm being hired and being paid to do a job. I will do that job. Okay, but I

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:46.250
Will write up

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.290
at some point when I have sufficient knowledge I

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.120
Will write up a

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.810
proposal that would very much align with MT

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:00.210
Titled

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:05.920
Here's the things that in in the process of doing work that I learned and

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:08.390
and I'm now going to give you as

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:11.670
Recommendations because you're my client

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:20.650
For the explicit purpose to making it harder for you to have to make the decision to hire me or someone like me

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:27.330
It's a tough thing to do as a consultant because or as a contractor because you're coming in you're hired to solve

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:34.010
Earlier I said how I'd use contractors to solve a short-term problem, but you're coming in to solve a short-term problem

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.010
But you want to also give them a long-term solution

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.490
and

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:42.090
In this particular case, even if you were in a QA agency

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:44.930
I

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:51.690
Would do that because it would positively impact my brand with that company or every other client I have

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:59.040
They go so they I would officially turn myself into the Mary Poppins of QA

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:03.800
That might even be the name of the company if it's not trademarked. I'm sure it's trademark

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.620
Alright, so we will we will we will dig into this later as more questions come up

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.680
But hopefully I can get this released and the sound doesn't suck

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.520
All right. Good chatting with you Brent and you Alan. All right
