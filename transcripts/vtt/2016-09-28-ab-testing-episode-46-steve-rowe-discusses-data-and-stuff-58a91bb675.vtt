WEBVTT

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.080
Hey everybody. Howdy. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're back for AAB testing episode 46.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:24.550
Hey Brent. Yes, I don't think we're alone now. We are not. Today we have a special guest.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.580
Is he special or just a guest? He's a special guest. A special guest. Steve Rowe is a data

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:42.300
scientist manager in the Windows team. His journey has been much like myself. Why don't

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.870
you say a few words, Steve, about how you got here?

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.910
Sure. So I'm Steve Rowe. I came through the same similar channel to Brent and perhaps Alan.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.570
I was a test developer for a long time in the Windows team. I did multimedia for a long

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.870
time and then I did some developer service stuff and then made a changeover to data science

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.230
as I saw things moving and changing and I thought that there was a lot more power in

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.950
figuring out whether we were doing the right thing or not and bringing quality through

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.320
data rather than quality through repeating testing over and over and over and over again.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.670
What's wrong with that? People are now worried for their jobs. Don't freak them out.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.180
There is, yes, there's some of that. There's going to be, what was it called, creative

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.820
destruction. I think would be Schumpeter's turn that is going on in some of this. So

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.700
I don't think you'll get rid of testers but I think that there's definitely a reduction

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.300
in the need for raw testers as they were replaced by data. Just the same way that there was kind

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.940
of a reduction in the need for manual testers as test development picked up.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.660
You'll see if you follow Steve Rowe's blogs, you'll definitely see that he's cut from

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.980
the same cloth as most of the three. Actually, it occurs to me. We have two of the three

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.760
in the room today.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.760
Wait.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760
Yeah.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760
I think I'm one.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.520
Yeah, but Alan doesn't listen to the podcast.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520
I do.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520
I have multiple personalities.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520
Those guys are smart.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520
Oh, God.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.400
Brent, Brent, Brent. So I have a question. I've been waiting to have a guest to do this because

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.520
like testing, if you ask two testers what they do, there's a lot of overlap Venn diagram

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.960
but there's differences. I think I bet my hunch is it's the same thing in the data

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.720
science world. So you've listened, you know Brent really well, you know what he does.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.400
What are some things that maybe differ in what your approach and what you do and then

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.200
what Brent does?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800
I don't quite know what Brent does well enough to tell you exactly what.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.120
Yeah, Brent doesn't do anything well.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.520
Well, then I do things well. So there's the difference.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.120
I do perception management really well, apparently.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.600
So my team is kind of a split team. Half my team is what I would call a data engineering

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.280
team and the other half is a data science team. And so we spend some of our time

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.160
figuring out how to move data and process data at volume and then some of our time

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.000
trying to actually analyze data and figure out what the insights are.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I think the big difference is organizationally we're probably at different

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.800
spots in an organization. Windows is still trying to figure out how to use data.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.640
And so as you guys have been talking the last few times about the process through

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.640
data, we're clearly past the data oblivious phase. We know no data exists but we're

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.960
still in this phase that I don't think you quite mentioned but kind of a

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.640
confirmatory data stage where half the time we want to use data but only if it

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.680
confirms our intuition. And we don't really want to be challenged by the data.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.400
I've heard some people around me say, you know, I only want this result if it's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.360
going to show me what I want because if it's not what I think is true, then I

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.880
know that the data is wrong, which is clearly an interesting stage to be in.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.760
So a lot of our job is spent trying to get the organization to pay attention

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.080
to data, to become more data literate and more understanding of what data

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.120
should be used for. So we have less opinions and more data-driven decisions.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.840
That's actually very interesting. There's something we talked about that data aware

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.120
stage, which was interesting and maybe it's somewhere in there. I think you're

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.310
much farther along than my org, for example. But there's a data trustworthy.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.630
Remember we used to deal with, used to, like last week with test trustworthiness.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.830
Can I trust that this test failure is a product failure? Or can I trust that

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.430
this test passing means the product's working correctly? We kind of, not kind

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.590
of, there's a huge parallel with data. Can I, is this data telling me, do I

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.590
believe this data? Do I not believe this data? Right. And I think that's, that's

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.390
accurately a question people ask because the one thing I keep telling my team

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.470
is when you're writing programs and you get them wrong, oftentimes they crash

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.270
or they go clearly incorrect. If you're using math, it doesn't generally crash.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.710
You can divide by zero. You can get some imaginary numbers, but not in

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.270
numbers, but otherwise it doesn't crash. It will happily tell you that the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.910
average house price is $2 billion. And if you believe it, you know, that's the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.830
case, right? It won't tell you, sorry, you gave me the wrong input. It'll just

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.910
tell you the average house price and value is $2 billion, which is off by at

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.570
least one zero. At least yeah. So I just had this happen yesterday. I, I got the

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:14.700
phone call, the IM, summoning me to the boss's rooms, the VP's room. And yeah,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.740
we looked at the bug data and some just going back a decade looking at bug data

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.340
and incoming rate was dropping way down. We're at the part of our product, right?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.170
Where it should and he looked, I don't believe it's dropped down that far. I said,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.850
well, that's what the data says. I'm gonna go take a look at it. I, that it

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.970
is a little bit too good to be true, but I think we're over that corner. And

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.570
sure enough, I go back to the data. Someone had mucked with a query

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:50.260
underneath me and got the, and screwed it up and they're off by about half. So

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:58.060
the numbers were not good, but it's like, I think anytime what my lesson learned

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.060
there was trust, but verify just, I think with, yeah, I think that was the

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.420
wise wisdom from way back. I've definitely seen it happen both ways. It's still

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.820
true here. People find data that they want to believe and they, they believe it

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.740
to be true. I remember years and years ago, somebody did some analysis, not like

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.220
data analysis, but some analysis of a, we had this big system called WTT windows

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.700
test technology or whatever. And there's all these jobs that ran tests, like

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.100
thousands and thousands of jobs that ran tests. And somebody came in one day to

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.100
a develop directors meeting and they said, half of these jobs don't work. I

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.500
ran my tool and I found out that half of them don't work. They just can't run

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.170
it all. And they were beating us up because we were all idiots for not

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.170
having working jobs. And we go back and we're like, well, they actually do

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.410
work. So what was going on? Well, their tool had forgotten how to parse or

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.810
they hadn't built it, how to parse variables. And so there might be a

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.930
directory like, you know, SQL and back just windows. And then we would say

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.290
winder in as a variable and it wouldn't parse the directory and go, well,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.650
there's no directory called winder. So therefore this can't possibly be

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.170
accessing anything on the system. They were happily trusting their data

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.130
instead of verifying it. And they were, you know, and that happens both

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.890
what happens that way, or it happens on the dev side or the PM side

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.170
sometimes where they don't want the data to tell them something wrong.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.490
Like I don't trust it no matter what, because it's not matching my

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.450
intuition. You do have a lot of those problems in, in the data science

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.770
space. I'll give you an example. Just yesterday, we have a new data

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.090
scientist that ramped up he's come from office, where they have a much

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:32.570
more well documented curated list of data sets. And he's like, Hey, I

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.010
want to do is essentially, hey, I want to do data science. Can you

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.800
point me to the documentation for our data sources? And I'm like, okay,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.440
dude, you and I need to meet. Because there are literally hundreds of

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.840
them, none documented. Right, we have, we have this one system that

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:04.130
does kind of automate away all the data movement for us. And they

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.850
able to use reflection to get essentially a reflection to get the

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:14.490
schema and publish the schema. But you have you have things like a

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.250
widget, goo it in a widget ID. Are these things the same thing? Or

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:24.330
are they not, right? We you have a lot of exceptions in the data

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.170
because the data doesn't come to us clean. You have a lot of

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.850
people who go to the raw data directly directly operate under the

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.490
belief that they do actually understand everything about the

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.330
data that they need to, which is I think similar to what Steve was

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.050
talking about, but they don't. So part of the things I do now is, hey,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:50.870
I'll point you to the data. If you present any analyses you do

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.750
without vetting it through me to make sure you've got the tribal

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.020
knowledge, right, dude, you're on your own. And when someone

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.380
comes to me and says, hey, your numbers don't line up with

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.980
Brent's. I'm telling you upfront, you're the one that's

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.020
going to do the the the digging to figure out why. So what do

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.780
you think is the right level of documentation to do on data

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.740
sources? Like I've seen people that want a white pages of data,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.860
right? I want to be able to like point you at every single data

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.540
source. I want to have them all fully documented. And then I've

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.060
seen teams that operate more like what you're talking about

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.460
where it's there's a bunch of data and you can kind of tell

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.460
the names, but you can't tell anything else. Where's the

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.300
right balance? Because you can get it right. You can easily

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.500
over index. So I'll tell you the approach that my team's

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:39.600
taking now. We are building what we call the CDW, which is a

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.160
common data warehouse. And it's initially we had planned it to

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.800
be something more directive where we would build it up and

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.260
then democratize it. Now what we are doing because I so I

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.940
flatted that as a proposal. And what it turns out is my own

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.150
team, Dev and PM, they're at the phase of Yeah, that could be

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.780
really useful as long as we don't have to build it. And so I

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:13.220
think the ROI of us doing that upfront is rather low, because

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.340
it's uncertain who who are going to be my customers if I

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:22.540
build it. But I need the data curated for I need a subset of

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.380
it for my purposes. So what my team is going to do is every

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.180
time we ingest a new data set, we'll curate it and then

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.180
we'll document it and we'll do it one at a time. I'd say right

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.900
now, most of 80% of what I'm working with is against 20

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.900
different data sets. That's easy enough to document. There's

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.700
there's a lot of asks for a lot more. But it's not high in my

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.820
backlog today. So when it becomes when it becomes it and I

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.500
then I pull the data in, I'll document it. In the meantime, what

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.300
I will do is document and police standards of practice. So

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.060
those those others who want a different data set, I'll say,

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.100
Hey, you're welcome to add to the CDW turn it into sort of a

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.260
shared source type project. And but you need to you will follow

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
these rules. Because if you don't, and I discover it, I

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.220
will remove your data from the CDW. Right? So I turned it

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.180
into much more of a shared source, but moderated to

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.540
prevent broken window theory.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.020
So you have a few sources, a limited number of sources that

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.180
are commonly used, they're all documented, and then everything

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.700
else is kind of still the wild west.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.700
Absolutely.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.820
What are some examples of data sources you use for data sets?

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.210
You can you can generify for the external audience.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.850
Until right now, I'm spending a large portion of my time

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.690
focused on availability concerns and reliability

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:56.360
concerns. So we have a transaction feed for the

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:03.110
heartbeat of VMs is the VM up or down. We have a ton of

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.470
metadata feeds, we have another transaction feed that that we use

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.500
quite often, which is our we call it our control plane. It's

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.540
essentially, hey, how many times the customer says create a VM?

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.220
Do we actually create a VM? Because now those two together,

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:28.540
we can then come up with new insights like hey, if a if a VM

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.660
goes down, can we determine if it was because the customer

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.500
asked for it to be down, which the heartbeat feed won't

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.290
necessarily tell you, but the control plane feed will. And

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.690
then we have a just a crap ton of dimension feeds, which is

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.770
essentially metadata about the nouns that we see in the

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:54.050
transaction feeds. So we'll have a VM dimension, it tells us

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.690
everything about where that VM lived and who it belongs to, we

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.810
have customer dimensions that say, hey, this customer is

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.530
Walmart, for example, and their headquarters are over and

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.210
wherever.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.770
Isn't that personally identifiable information?

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:17.380
It is not. That is tenant, what's known as tenant identifiable

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.020
information. And that is fine.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.820
I said that because we've had the same discussion often in my

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.740
team. So what about you, Steve, what data sets is your team

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.460
primarily working?

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.100
So we have quite a I work in the developer space. So I work

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.780
with a lot of application development and application

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.940
lifecycle kind of data. So we have a lot of streams that

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.730
show us like what applications this is for people that send us

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.810
data or in the beta program, not the general machines out

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.290
there. But we have data that tells us like what applications

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.210
were installed or attempted to install and which ones

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.610
succeeded or didn't succeed what the application lifecycles

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.290
were, was it launched? Did it go into suspend? When was it

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.450
killed? Or was it closed down? That kind of stuff. And so we

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.490
can see whether or not applications are successful or

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.490
not. We also have interesting data, we can watch what API's

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.730
various apps call. And so we can use that data to do cool

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.210
things like figure out whether or not the build of the

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.810
operating system regressed an app. So let's say that maybe

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.250
the Facebook app calls this networking API 40 times in the

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.050
first minute or whatever. If I can actually watch that over

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.530
time and say, Oh, on this day, it dropped down to 20, we

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.810
probably just broke that application. What we do wrong,

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.330
I don't know yet, we'll go figure it out. But we can

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.450
actually see in the data that that application broke on a

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.010
given build of Windows because that it behaves very

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.970
differently than it used to behave.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:30.940
That's cool.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.940
Wasn't Windows recently in the news on this data thing?

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.420
Isn't it wasn't at Windows, the where we announced or

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.940
where it was announced that we are following all of you?

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.300
I don't think so. No, there was some news. I don't

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.060
actually follow the news. We don't follow everybody. We

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.460
certainly don't. We have very strict restrictions on

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.500
pride, personally identifiable information and all

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.620
kinds of stuff that we do to make sure that we can't

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.860
track people. You can also turn it off. And, you know,

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.820
that kind of stuff. So if you're in the beta program, we

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.980
tend to watch more because it'll check boxes that tend to

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.140
be on by default. But a typical person using Windows has

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.940
a lot more control over it. And we don't do anything

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.540
that we would identify you as anything. So

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.940
so you do not have the ability to see what websites

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.900
Alan is looking at.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.220
We go out of our way not to be.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.770
Just mostly I shop on Amazon. Just total tangent

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.970
because that's part of the show. I was talking to

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.760
neighbor my works at Amazon and I said, man, if I

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.000
got a discount there, oh, it says we get a discount.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.560
And but it's like, it's not really much they get

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.480
like 10 percent up to a thousand dollars.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.390
Yeah. So they get one hundred dollars a year.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.070
Yeah. So basically they get a hundred. It's not much.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.110
And you worked there for two years. So really you

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.990
got about two hundred dollars as you.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.710
It's more than that. But it's like a really when

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.710
you do the math, he's really excited about it.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.670
The math. I go, wait a minute.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.190
Yeah, it is something like that. I've heard friends

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:00.630
talk about it.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.430
So that's their equivalent of the company store

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.950
program.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:10.400
I guess because yeah, I'm I don't like shopping in

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.800
stores. So I'll buy clothes in stores. And

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.480
obviously I don't buy clothes very often, but

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.680
everything else I buy. Eventually they wear out.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.650
Well, you don't have to stop wearing them when

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.650
they wear out. That is a common misconception.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.850
You can just keep on wearing them. This T-shirt I

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.090
bought in 1998. Still little colors falling off.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.730
Windows 95 on it or something.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.170
No, I was wearing this when I was working on

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:34.970
Windows 95.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.500
And that's the nice thing, right? With with if

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.620
he just waits long enough, he'll have his team

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.380
feed him new clothes.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.650
Although no one commonly gives out T-shirts or

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.210
common, but no one's doing pants.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.170
No, I haven't. I don't know that I've ever

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.770
gotten pants.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.610
I have me neither. No, I'm I'm kind of upset.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.080
I think I saw a pair of shorts once.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.480
That's an oversight. I don't nothing shirt.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.360
Lots of T-shirts.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.920
Jackets. I just got to meet yet another jacket.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.360
I've got two jackets on this team, a sweatshirt

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:09.960
and a jacket.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.400
So maybe you should propose when your when your

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.160
product finally ships, you get a pair of sweat

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.800
pants with the product name right on the butt.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.400
Like those pink ones.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.960
Right. Yeah. Juicy.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.100
That's the name of our product.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.900
They just take things for a leak in our product

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.700
game. Microsoft Juicy for business.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.660
Actually, I saw PR for your product recently.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.980
So you guys are announced now.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.660
No, we're not.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.340
I didn't see anything.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.380
Nothing. Nothing.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.740
Nothing. I saw something.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.900
There's nothing nothing condoned by our

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.660
organization has been released on the interwebs.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.220
Gotcha.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.340
And that's where we're going to keep that one.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.030
So I've done enough things to piss off management.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.590
I'm not going to go there.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.350
So Steve's here.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.430
Yeah. Hey.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.300
So back to Steve.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.180
What are we going to say?

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.140
How about now?

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.020
Sabre.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.430
Go ahead.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.430
So Steve.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.990
Yes, Brad.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.170
Um, I anxiously await your question.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.450
I anxiously wait his question too.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.690
So I've, I've gone through and sort of walk

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.370
through how I got to the position I'm in right now.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:25.160
Uh, a lot of our listeners are, I'll say data

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.640
curious, right?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.440
Um, and it's very, very clear that they are

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.220
operating in worlds that are behind us in some

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.100
degree, very similar to us, uh, 10, 15 years ago.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.980
Or three years ago.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.700
How would you, how would you guide from, from your

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.940
experience, how would you guide people, uh, making

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.740
this transition?

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.300
I think it depends on what course you're going

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:53.540
to take.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.580
So there's two courses to try to get your team

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.580
to be more data driven.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.140
Uh, one is a top down approach and the other one

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.460
is kind of a bottoms up approach.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.570
Um, so you can either try to find or convince

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.890
management that this is a good thing.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.690
And then management can create the edict that we

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.600
will go do this and, uh, then started building up

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.040
the organizational skills from there.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.600
Or you can try to make your little section of

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.640
the world more data driven and do that in a way

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.680
that also gets your other jobs done and try to

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.680
become a center of excellence.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.000
And people might mock, might follow you, uh, over

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.200
time and emulate you.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.520
And those are both possible routes.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.760
Um, I suspect most of our readers, listeners,

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.040
whatever, uh, we'll have to be in the second

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.000
bucket because probably most of them are not

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.520
directors or, you know, CEOs or whatever, and

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.000
they don't get to come down with the, with

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.720
the edict, they can try to convince management,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.920
but it's not always easy to convince management

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.320
to do anything new and different because it's

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.400
scary and dangerous.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.720
Um, and so I think that the pattern is to try

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.600
to start at the bottom.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.800
Uh, a lot of times as unfortunate as that is,

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.640
I think it's a harder road to go, but it's

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.920
also the only road available a lot of times.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.800
Um, and I think the right way to do that is

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.870
to figure out where, where you can replace

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.870
current functionality with this data or

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.030
supplement it with data.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.510
I don't think that you can just say, we're

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.350
not going to test anymore.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.150
We're going to use data.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.670
Cause I don't think anybody's going to believe

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.550
that that is effective enough in order to

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.870
let you spend the time doing that.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.470
They're going to still expect their test passes,

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.990
but you can start running data analysis on

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.670
the test passes.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.390
You can start running data.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.390
You can try to get some instrumentation into

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.790
the builds.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.430
A lot of people have at least logs or

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.790
something along those lines, convince the

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.510
devs or go at it yourself, depending on

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.830
where you are organizationally and

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.910
what's allowed, and then use that to

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.430
try to understand, uh, whether, um, your,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.550
the quality is high or not.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.590
I think there's two major uses of

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.310
data, um, in an organization.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.630
One use is to understand the health of

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.750
the product and the other one is to

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.550
understand what I call the success of

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.030
the product.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.230
So the first one is to figure out whether

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.870
or not what you built is doing what you

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:45.870
expected it to do.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.670
And the other one is figuring out, figure

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.510
out whether or not the users are

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.830
appreciating what you built.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.350
Um, and I think it's much easier to bootstrap

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.070
the first one, the health metrics than

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.110
it is the other ones, because it's

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.270
more of a drop in replacement for, or

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.270
a supplement for traditional testing.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.910
And, uh, I have a couple of blog posts

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.150
from way back talking about data

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.350
driven quality and kind of moving in

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.230
that direction, which focused mostly on

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.230
those health metrics.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.990
And so I think one thing you can do is

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.510
you can start monitoring the percentage

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.950
of time that your test passes fit, pass

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.430
or fail.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.030
You can start monitoring data about

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.150
the machines or the builds or the, the

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.630
environments that they're in and try

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.150
to tease out data from there.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.710
Um, and then you can over time, maybe

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.470
start getting data from real instances

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.910
of the application, either through logs

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.350
or through some kind of, uh, you

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.750
know, data API that you have.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.710
If you're in a server, you can do

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.790
it much more easily than if you're,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.270
you're running distributed software.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.870
Um, and then figure out whether or not

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.150
I can give you some sense for the

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.030
quality of your product, uh, for the,

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.150
the health of your product.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.710
And then maybe you can turn down

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.950
the dial on testing and turn up the

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:45.590
dial on data.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.830
What about your journey personally?

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.690
So how long ago were you in a, a,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.650
let's just say a pure traditional

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.410
test manager role?

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.370
About three years ago.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.290
It was the fall, about three years

00:21:59.290 --> 00:21:59.610
ago, right?

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.850
When we started the work on, on

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.530
windows 10 that I moved from a

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.770
traditional test developer job to,

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.130
uh, a data science job.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.830
When, when, uh, so windows was

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.470
essentially the first of your two

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.510
ways to get there.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.590
If I, if I recall correctly, you, in

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.790
other words, it wasn't a bunch of

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.470
small satellite teams trying to

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.110
convince upper management upper

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.830
men, as this is my perception from

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.990
outside of windows, it was upper

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.350
management said, no, we're doing.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.830
It was definitely a, a, a student

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.830
body left movement.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.950
Like everybody, uh, has to go this

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:33.270
direction.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.070
We took what was a standard test

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.390
developer role and said that role

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.390
no longer exists.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.110
We now have a quality role, which is

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.510
not the same as a data science role,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.470
but this thing we call the quality

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.670
role, which is just a label we put

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.470
on it, um, was all about using data

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.790
to understand the quality of our

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.110
product.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.430
So we had in that group, we have

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.830
people that are more traditional

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.310
developers whose job it is to

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.870
instrument the builds and then do

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.830
basic analysis on those builds and,

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.310
and understand the area very well.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.470
And then we have data scientists

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.510
whose job it is to help bring actual

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.270
math to the, to the problems, um,

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.470
in, in non-basic ways.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.790
Um, I'd like to think of, there's

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.990
a Venn diagram that's pretty

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.950
popular out there that says data

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.190
science is kind of a combination

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.590
of area knowledge, programming

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.590
knowledge, and statistics or

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.990
math.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.390
And I tend to think that no one

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.110
person really has all of those.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.070
And so we've almost ended up in

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.750
a world where the area knowledge

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.790
and the programming knowledge are

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.190
owned by one group of people.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.590
That's the quality teams.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.430
And then the, the data science

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.030
knowledge or the, the statistics

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.990
knowledge, and then maybe some of

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.430
the programming knowledge as well is

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.910
owned by the data science teams.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.670
And so the combination ends up with

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.830
a sweet spot in the middle.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.040
So when, when they pulled this

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.320
trigger, were you anxious or

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.120
excited about it?

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.440
I was personally excited about it.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.520
I'd thought about it for a while.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.760
I'd actually been looking for ways

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.400
to try to go do this in my, my old job.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.920
The difficulty that I had as I was

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.200
on the team that was developing

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.320
what was called Windows runtime,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.600
which is the API model for all

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.640
of the, the Windows apps, uh, the

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.600
app store apps, the hard part

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.560
about that is trying to use

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.000
data in something that has a very

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.760
long pipeline is super difficult.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.600
You can't exactly A B test an API.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.680
You can't send it out, you know,

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.960
one version of the API to it, to

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.160
developer a and one version of

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.240
developer B and see which one

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:08.840
works better.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.440
You know, you can't really watch

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.960
for applications to be submitted to

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.760
a store somewhere six months after

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.840
you introduce the API and then

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.720
start gathering data.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.320
So it was the, one of the more

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.840
difficult places to go use data.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.920
And so I hadn't figured out yet

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.640
the right way to go use it in

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.880
that space until the edict came

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.720
down. Um, and then we moved, but

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.080
even there we ended up in a world

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.080
where although upper management

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.200
said, go do this upper management

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.320
didn't really know exactly what

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:31.960
they wanted to do with it.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.880
Either they knew they wanted to

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.160
get there, but they didn't know

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.160
they'd never done it before.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.120
And so they didn't know what

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.160
parts to appreciate or not

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.040
appreciate. And there was a lot

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.000
of, of trying and failing and

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.440
learning that happened along the

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.560
way. And so we had a lot of

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.100
we're getting much better, but

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.540
we had a lot of, uh, early

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.620
pressure from the top to go do

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.180
this. And then various teams

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.260
tried different things. And so

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.020
you ended up with kind of

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.020
this hybrid model where there

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.820
was a lot of local, uh, idea

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.660
development and talent

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.580
development and, and ways to

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.940
use stuff that was developed and

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.700
then kind of pushed out to

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.500
other people as centers of

00:24:59.500 --> 00:24:59.940
excellence.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.660
So it was a couple of things on

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.700
you, uh, touch on that you

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.340
talked about one was, uh, going

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.700
way back the, um, this is why I

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.870
edit. You were talking about,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.790
uh, you can either have an edict

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.150
from top or sort of, you know,

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.230
grassroots and, you know, try

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.990
stuff and do it gradually. Uh,

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.830
generally that latter approach

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.230
in my experience sticks more. If

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.950
it's harder to do driving from

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.550
the bottom up, but it, in my

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.430
experience in any sort of

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.390
organizational changes sort of

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.670
sticks more, um, edicts are

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.430
interesting and they can often

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:37.480
work. They're often difficult to

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.360
get, you know, all the time I

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.920
see people, they go to a VP or

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.240
somebody high up and go, you

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.400
should demand that the whole

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.520
org does this. And they rarely

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.960
ever do that because they,

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.840
it's not always a good thing to

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.420
make an edict. Uh, but one

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.380
thing was interesting, glad you

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:52.940
touched on it with the

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.140
windows one is, is they said

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.970
we're making this change and

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.050
the, how does it happen and

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.130
what does it mean was all left

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.090
in the air. So was why, no, no,

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.130
why was there? Why was not

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.650
partially there. I'll go more

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.570
than what or how. So there was

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.450
this and either it was, and

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.730
Steve and I may be on two sides

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.970
of this, but it may be either

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.730
genius or idiocy of this. Just

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.210
let a thousand flowers bloom.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.890
And the end of worked out.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:26.850
All right. Regardless of the

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.930
how it got there, let a

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.210
thousand flowers bloom and the

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.960
strong flowers will guide the

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.520
way for the slash and burn all

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.760
the white ones, keep the red

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.160
ones. Is that you describe it

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.320
like we were sitting on a hill

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.440
and we, they showed us this

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.720
picture across the valley of

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.800
another city on another hill.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.480
And he said, we want to get

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.560
there. And you have this

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.840
valley laid out in front of

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.360
you covered with clouds, you

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.840
know, and fog. And they said,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.760
go over to that other hill.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.280
And you're like, well, what

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.320
do I need? Do I need like a

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.360
camel? Do I need a parka? Do

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.600
I need a boat? Like, how am

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.320
I getting there? Like, we

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.960
don't know, just go, you

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.000
know. And so we all tried. And

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.680
those of us that chose

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.680
camels, you know, ended up

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.800
poor in the, in the, you

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.040
know, middle of the Arctic or

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.570
and you get halfway there. And

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.410
some people say, let's turn

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.530
back. This isn't working.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:06.530
We're not all the way to the

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.610
city yet. Let's turn back. And

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:08.610
so we had those people that

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.890
said, let's go back to the

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:10.890
traditional ways of doing

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.170
things. I miss this part

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.530
that I had before. And then

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.930
some of us pushed on and

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:15.690
we're still in the process.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.290
We haven't gotten all the

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.130
way to the city. Maybe a

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:17.890
few. I think that's true

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.090
across a lot of Microsoft.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.050
I think a lot of people

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.010
have made it to the city.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.610
There are a ton of people

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.410
who just want to go back

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.330
to their old comfortable

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.710
city that that comfortable

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.190
city that's it's now been

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.230
raised to the ground.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.670
No, it's full. It's full

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.510
of great 90s grunge music

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.270
and other things from the

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.660
90s, many other things from

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.260
the 90s.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.820
Yes. The problem is that

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.740
people don't realize that

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.820
the old way was just not

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.540
fast enough. You're

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.740
guaranteed to be beaten by

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.780
your competition. That's

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.660
what I was saying. All the

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.220
old ways. That's what I

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.740
was saying when when this

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.850
first rolled out, like, I

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.010
think we were still doing

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.570
a we we were doing the

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.530
podcast then one of the

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.410
biggest things that both

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:57.650
Alan and I discovered during

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.090
those phases, explaining to

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.810
people why from a business

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.290
context, because the

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.050
number one question we got,

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.130
at least I got from from

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.330
individuals in the

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.290
Windows org was no one's

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.370
explaining why the old

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.650
system is broken today.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.630
Right. It's kind of a

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.870
precursor towards these

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.880
folks who if if they're

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.920
forced to journey are

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.360
likely to want to go

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:25.880
back.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.760
Right. I think that

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.800
they're there. We could

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.520
have been better about

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.640
that. If you go back,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.360
there's some blog posts I

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.200
have on kind of the

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.040
development of tests or the

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.000
evolution of testing and

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.200
we kind of walk through. I

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.920
think the important thing

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.920
to recognize is that the

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.600
people who have made it

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.960
to data science, you know,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.200
Island or Hill or

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.280
whatever, sometimes look

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.280
back and go, we were all

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.240
idiots. That was a terrible

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:43.960
way to do things. It was

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.240
never a good way. You

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.840
know, and I think that's

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.680
wrong. I think there was

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.440
certainly a point in

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.920
time and certain

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.230
requirements in the in

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.550
the environment and around

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.870
the ecosystem that made

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.670
that the right way to go

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.710
do things and still to

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:57.510
this day makes it the

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.470
right way way to do

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.830
certain kinds of work. I

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.430
think you can't say

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.870
that data science and

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.870
data driven quality is the

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.350
only possible way to

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.350
handle quality and it's

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.270
probably not the end way

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.030
that will handle quality.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.630
There are probably other

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.070
ways that will be

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.030
invented later that will

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.510
replace those a lot of it.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.710
But to say that manual

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:14.750
testing was always a bad

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.110
idea or that S-net work

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.230
was always a bad idea is

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.270
to ignore what was

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.510
actually happening in the

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.350
industry at the time. And

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.830
I think those were

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:21.830
actually very good

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.830
things to happen at

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.270
points in time when you

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.310
had certain requirements

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.950
from the ecosystem. If

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:27.590
you don't have the

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.190
ability to quickly push

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.390
new software out, if you

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.470
have to get it into a box

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.190
and get it onto somebody's

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.870
desk, you can't use the

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.630
data driven world that

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.190
we have. If you're not

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.150
connected, you can't use a

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.430
data driven system. And

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.150
so there was a point in

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.190
time when that was exactly

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.510
the right solution. We've

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.390
just moved past that

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.510
time. Right. I think I

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:47.050
totally agree. And one bit

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.010
of advice for pretty much

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.370
anything you're doing is

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:51.650
look for efficiency and

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.810
don't fall into that.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:53.850
That's the way we've

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.650
always done it. Trap. And

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.290
don't fall into that.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.050
That's the new way to

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:57.890
do a trap either.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:58.850
Sometimes it's the new

00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:59.970
shiny way. And so

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:00.890
everything has to be

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.530
rewritten or redone to be

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.370
the new shiny way. And

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.410
it doesn't always apply to

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.170
every part of every

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.010
industry, right? If

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.570
you're working on

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.890
healthcare equipment, I'm

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.090
not sure that data driven

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:09.970
stuff is the best way to

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:10.890
go. Like, oh, we killed

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.490
three people. We should

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.610
probably change that. It

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.570
depends on the area of

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.690
health, right? If it's

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.610
in some areas, yeah, but

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.050
there may be some, uh,

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.330
I'm trying to think while

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.250
I talk here, but, uh,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.930
some more preventative

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:24.610
things. Maybe there's a

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.810
better way to measure your

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.850
blood pressure. I always

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.530
see every time I go to

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:28.170
the doctor, they have

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.290
like some better device

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.330
measure my blood pressure

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.290
and, and they have like

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.730
scales that are networked.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.130
And there's a lot of, there

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.450
is room for, I think even

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.570
in healthcare to have more

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.810
data science and to learn

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.970
how doctors are using

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:42.890
things and to make tweaks

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:43.530
in the equipment. Yeah,

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.010
you got to figure out

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.650
where the places are. I

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:46.290
think it's always a

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.290
question of, of how long

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.050
the damage is going to be

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.050
sustained and how big the

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.210
damage is. Right. And

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:51.850
that's how you figure

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.730
out whether you need,

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:53.410
whether you need to

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.490
scale things. And so if I,

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.810
if I, the advantage of

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.010
using data is that I can

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:57.690
release something into

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:58.650
the wild for a little

00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.770
while, and I can quickly

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:00.890
fix it, which means that

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:01.930
the data is the damage

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:02.570
that is doing, if it's

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.610
wrong, isn't sustained

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:04.930
very long in the old

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:05.450
world, it had to be

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.370
sustained for months or

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.250
years because of the

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.250
release cycles. Now you

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.050
can have it out there for

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.410
a day or half a day and

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.610
fix it, which is all

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.770
awesome until you have

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.370
an infinite cost, right?

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.770
If, if one second of

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:16.570
damage or one split

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.690
second of damage, it

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:18.810
causes a death or causes

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:19.690
major harm and you

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:20.490
can't afford to let that

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.090
go. And you have to

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.850
fix it before you

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.130
possibly, or even

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:23.970
worse breaks the

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.370
Facebook app. Yes. Yeah.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.010
That's, that's

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:27.810
unconscionable. We are

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.210
definitely, we are

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.250
definitely in a world

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.610
where we have a lot more

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:34.770
options than we did

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.730
back in the day. I do,

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.770
to your point, like there

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.290
is a lot of revisionism

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:43.690
in a lot of the people

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.210
that I talked to, right?

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.770
It's easy to predict the

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.050
future in hindsight.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:48.730
Yeah. Especially to

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.500
create it. Right. The

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.960
lot of the world and

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.720
back in those days, a

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.440
lot of the world and in

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.480
a lot of our listeners, I

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.120
think I still are still in

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.560
what we refer to as the

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.360
old days. Yeah, I think

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.160
they are. They're, they're

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.800
missing knowledge. They're

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.760
missing assets that we've

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.160
built up over, over the

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.310
years. Um, the, the

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.790
positive thing though,

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.650
is in today's world,

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.850
there's a lot of other

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.890
examples to learn from.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.650
You don't have to treat

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.890
it as theoretical. I know

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.130
back in the windows 95

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.970
days, if I had brought up

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.570
anything along the lines

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:37.170
of what I do today, they

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.330
would look at me like I

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.690
had three heads. Right. And

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.510
it's just because the

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.150
ideas of this type of

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.150
work that we do and the

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.030
benefits of it were sort

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.310
of academic theoretical at

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.270
that point in time.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:53.830
Well, at that point,

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:54.190
that would have been

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.150
impossible to carry out.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:55.870
But even if assuming it

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:56.550
was possible, you're

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.470
right. They would have

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.230
looked at you like, this

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.990
doesn't make any sense

00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.630
because they were just

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:00.710
moving to a large test

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.150
organization at that

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.830
point in time. Like that

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.190
was kind of when a lot of

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.990
the independent test

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.750
organizations are starting

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.190
to spin up. Um, I think

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.870
around that time, maybe

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.110
today, just been up not

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.110
too long before that.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.760
Now back to your personal

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.390
journey. So you've been,

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:16.230
you've been doing this

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.270
for three years.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:17.630
Correct.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.390
What did you do to

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.870
prepare yourself to be

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.470
the head of a, of a

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.230
data science that

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.270
engineering team, did you

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.150
have that skillset

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:27.630
beforehand?

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.790
No, I didn't at all. I,

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:29.590
in fact, I've never even

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.470
taken a statistics course

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.470
when I was in college. So

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.230
I was uniquely on

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.630
skilled in this particular,

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:35.550
in this particular thing.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.670
So what I did is what I

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.630
always do. And I started

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.750
reading, I started

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.910
reading blogs, I started

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.110
reading books, I started

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.470
reading papers. Um, and

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.950
then around that time,

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.510
all the, the MOOCs, the

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.470
Massly online open

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:47.790
courses, like Coursera and

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.230
edX, et cetera, uh,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.270
started existing. And so

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:50.870
I took a lot of the

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.430
courses. There's a whole

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.030
series of, of almost

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:54.910
collegiate level courses

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:55.750
that you can take for,

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.950
for free or almost for

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.430
free. Um, and so I went

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:59.470
through a lot of those,

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.230
um, over time, I had to

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.230
learn a lot of the

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.990
techniques that I had to

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.710
go learn. So you have to

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.630
kind of become rigorous

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:05.150
and go back to

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.430
fundamentals and learn

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.190
the basics so you can

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:08.430
figure out what to apply.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.830
Um, and then you have to

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.910
read, you have to figure

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:11.550
out where it applies and

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.110
where it doesn't apply.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:12.670
But a lot of it, you

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.430
have to understand enough

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:14.150
techniques in order to

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:14.910
go back and be able to

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:15.550
figure out which ones to

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.310
apply and not apply.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.430
Is there one thing if

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:20.390
you were to say, if you

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.830
only do one to start

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:22.950
from your experience,

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:24.390
what is the one concrete

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:25.510
thing you would suggest?

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.630
If you're trying to,

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.270
is there a data scientist?

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.070
Right. Yeah. So there's

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:30.750
there's a series of

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.790
MOOCs, about nine, eight

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:32.590
or nine of them, depending

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.390
on the take the caps in

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.190
from, uh, Johns Hopkins

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.630
University, um, which is

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.750
called, I think like data

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.110
science or whatever. Um,

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.150
it's on Coursera and

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:40.870
there's a series of,

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:41.710
of they're offered every

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:42.710
month or one per month.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.350
And I would suggest going

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:43.830
through that set of

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:44.750
courses. It's a very good

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.990
set of courses. Most of

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.630
them aren't too hard.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:47.310
There's a few of them

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.150
that are quite rigorous.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:49.390
Um, but when you get

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:49.990
to the end of it, you'll

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.110
have a very good sense

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:51.710
for things. You won't

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.190
be a PhD by any stretch

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.270
of the imagination, but

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.950
you will have a very

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:55.910
strong sense of things.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.710
And how often have you

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.790
been finding yourself

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.110
using what you've

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.510
learned in your job?

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.390
Daily, probably. Right.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:04.510
So my job today is as

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.550
a manager. So I don't do

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.190
a lot of the direct, uh,

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:08.590
data analysis, but I

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.510
overview a lot of with

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:10.270
the data analysis. And

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.390
so I will oftentimes meet

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.910
with my teams and

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:12.310
they'll say, we're going

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.030
to go report this. And

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.030
I'm like, well, what

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.870
about that? You've

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:15.710
missed this corner over

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.630
here. Maybe you should

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.750
use this technique. And

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.510
so those all become

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.550
useful to ask questions

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.870
to make suggestions, um,

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:22.670
and to understand what

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.430
is possible and what's

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.550
not a lot of data science

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.030
can feel like magic and

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.870
but it can't do

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.790
everything. And so you

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:29.470
have to understand where

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.430
the constraints are in

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.950
order to be able to

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:31.910
figure out what to tell

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:32.950
your teams to go do or

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:34.430
to try to go do. Um,

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.070
one of the things I

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:35.750
think is important is

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.430
to realize that you

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:37.350
also need to be

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.590
willing to make mistakes

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.430
and willing to fail. And

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.030
so there's definitely

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.470
times when I have sent

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:42.350
my team off to go do

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.390
something and it turned

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:44.190
out it wasn't possible

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.110
to do like we went and

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:45.950
tried really hard and

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:46.870
then realized, you

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:47.910
know, PhDs in the

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.790
corners of universities

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.430
haven't yet figured

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.030
out how to go do this

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.430
thing. So it's

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.550
probably not possible.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.630
And then it's your

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.310
reaction to that.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:53.950
That's important. You

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:54.630
have to go like, okay,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.990
cool. Now we know and

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.590
we'll go down a different

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.750
path. No way they

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:58.390
can't figure out you

00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:59.310
fire them all. Get some

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.230
smarter people in the

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.790
room. That is sometimes

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:02.990
the management strategy.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.590
That's not the one

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.470
that I recommend. Um,

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:06.550
just just throwing

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.670
spitballs. I think

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:08.470
we're very much in a

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.870
world. Uh, one thing

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:10.430
that I've noticed is

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.990
the world of, of test

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.150
development and to some

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.750
extent, the world of

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:14.750
development is a much

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.390
more constrained world,

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:17.430
meaning you generally

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.270
don't send people to go

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.910
do something that you

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:19.910
don't know is possible

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.110
to go do. It does

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.990
happen. Um, and you

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.670
can go read like show

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.350
stopper about the

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.270
building of NT and there

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.870
were people that were

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:26.950
sent off to go build a

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:27.830
graphic system that they

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:28.470
didn't even know was

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.430
possible. And they went

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.030
off and I think lived on

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.790
a boat for like three

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.830
months and came back

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.390
with a, with, with GDI

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.670
or whatever, uh, out of

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.350
the system. But, um,

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:37.870
that's rare. Most of

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:38.350
the time you're sent

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:38.830
to go do something

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:39.510
that everybody knows

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.230
is doable. It's just a

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.550
question of how long it

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.390
takes. When you're in

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.990
the world of data

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.870
science, you don't know

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.310
if there's enough

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.750
signal among all the

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.350
noise in order to be

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.390
able to generate what

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.910
you need. You

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:48.710
sometimes will go,

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:49.430
we'll get something and

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.630
realize all I can tell

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:51.350
you is there's no

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.020
conclusive answer and

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.980
that has to be okay.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.020
There's another

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.220
tangent. This is my job

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.060
to make tangents today

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.180
cause I don't know

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.100
nothing about no data

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.210
science. I know a little

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.250
just enough to freak

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.290
Brent out, but for the

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:06.490
younger of the three

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.090
listeners, there's only

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:08.890
one left of two are

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.010
here. Um, one thing I

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.810
wanted to call out, it

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:12.450
wasn't just that the

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.290
guys went off and

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.770
built GDI, but it, you

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:16.970
know, in seclusion, but

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.810
imagine if you will

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.490
building complex

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.690
software without the

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.980
internet. Yeah. Without

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.820
stack overflow, without

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.740
Google or Bing, you can't

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.500
just ask somebody how to

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.840
go do it. Uh, what an

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.320
archaic world. My job

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.480
today, trees that will

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.360
give you a hint. Yeah.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.560
My job today would,

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.680
would have been so much

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.280
harder to get to. And,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.670
um, I'll double quote

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.270
master without the

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.030
internet for sure. One

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.710
thing. And yeah,

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.990
everything is faster. Uh,

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.070
the reason that we're

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.870
data science as a role

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:56.670
is cause we're moving so

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.430
much faster, both for

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:58.550
necessity and for, and

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.750
because, uh, possibility.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.230
One of the great moves

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.070
about moving to a lot more

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.150
open source at Microsoft

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.150
using things like Git

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.750
for source control is

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.590
all of a sudden, uh, we

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.030
used to have like

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.870
horrible internal

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:10.830
documentation for our

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.670
internal tools, if

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.390
they were documented at

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.230
all. But now that we're

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.190
using a lot more stuff,

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.910
open source answers are

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.150
on stack overflow answers

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.150
are documented in blog

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.870
posts. It's, it's, it's

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.350
been, it's accelerated.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.310
At least one fantastic

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.310
thing our team does, I

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.030
pick on our lack of

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.390
data science, but, uh,

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:27.190
we have a very good

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.110
modern engineering

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.310
system. It's all builds

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.270
in Azure. I find them

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:32.990
red. Woo hoo. Use a

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.310
lot of VSTS get first

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.670
source control, uh, the

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.630
whole crap ton of open

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:39.830
source and enables us

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:40.630
to move pretty fast

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.550
despite ourselves.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.460
Yeah. It's, it's

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.100
interesting to leverage

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.620
the new world, but

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.820
it's also changed the

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.660
way that people learn.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.460
It used to be, you went

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.420
and you got a book and

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.500
you read and you got,

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.100
and that kind of

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.020
forced you to get an

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:51.940
overview of the whole

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.860
area and kind of get

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.700
deep and realize how

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.100
the pieces are

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.260
connected. And now you

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.900
almost have, um, a

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.580
paging system where you

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.820
don't even have the data

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.660
until you need it. And

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.300
then you go to stack

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.500
overflow or you go to a

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.260
search engine and you

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.340
find it. And so you

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.340
kind of piecemeal build

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:06.900
this thing up in your

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.500
head, but you don't

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.220
understand the big

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.300
picture sometimes

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.540
almost ever. You just

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.140
learn the pieces you

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.780
absolutely need to

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.660
learn. And then you

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.540
move on and that's

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.180
good and bad.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.540
Yeah, I agree too. I

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.700
call it just in time

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.380
learning the, actually

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.580
to that point. So you've

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.660
been here at least 15

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.180
years, right?

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.160
About 19. Okay. So

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.880
almost catching up with

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.240
you guys.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.030
The, the, the situation

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.790
you went through three

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:35.910
years ago, where you

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.310
were, um, told to go

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.270
into this space, which

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.030
was fine. Cause that's

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.670
where you wanted to go

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.250
anyway. If that had

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.130
happened 15 years ago,

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.450
what do you think would

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.090
have happened to you?

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:49.310
It would have been

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.950
different, right? It

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:50.750
would have been, you

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:51.870
know, go find books and

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:52.790
read a lot of books

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:53.550
and then, and then

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.470
figure out how to go

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.590
do it from there. Um,

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.350
which is a lot harder.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.350
The hardest part

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.430
actually would 15 years

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.470
ago is there's no

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.910
tooling. So 15 years

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:02.470
ago, everything was

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.310
proprietary tooling.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.350
Everything costs money

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:05.030
or the company had to

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.350
go build it. And so

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.510
today I can just go and

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.590
I can get our, or I can

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.630
get Python and I can

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.830
have basically every

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.430
data tool I want at my

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:13.670
fingertips and a bunch

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.310
of documentation on how

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:14.790
to go use it.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.110
And examples everywhere.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.270
And examples everywhere.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.190
Back then you

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.750
probably would have to

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.670
go get a book that told

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.670
you here's how

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.590
logistic regression is

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.870
implemented in math and

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:23.270
you would have had to

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.990
turn that into an

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.270
algorithm and write your

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.110
own logistic regression

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:26.430
routine.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.510
I, as, as our listeners

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.470
know, I've gone back

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.970
to school on this. Um, I

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:35.130
don't, if, if this had

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.490
happened to me 15 years

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.420
ago, I don't think I'd

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.690
be in this role. Right.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.680
Cause it, it's, um, it

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.680
would have been a lot

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.000
harder to, to quickly,

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.680
first and foremost, online

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.000
academia didn't exist.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.380
Right. Um, so I would

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.820
have had to gone to U-Dub

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.980
or some other, um, travel

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.940
situation, which would

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.620
made my life a lot harder.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.660
Uh, so much so I may not

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:09.300
have done it.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.380
Yeah. I mean, you kind

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.580
of had to, I actually

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.620
had to some extent that

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.060
I was strangely enough,

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.620
I was, uh, in law school

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.100
when I started at

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.580
Microsoft. Um, and it

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.300
didn't have much in the

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.100
programming background.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.020
So I went to U-Dub's

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.140
website that existed, but

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.700
didn't have much

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.740
resources on it. And I,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.580
I figured out what books

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.020
you read for a, uh, CS

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.940
degree. And I read those

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.540
books. Um, I went to, you

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.780
know, the local borders

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.700
and I bought them and

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.700
then I read those books.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.780
So I have like half of

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.860
a CS degree cause I

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:35.300
didn't do any of the

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.340
homework. C plus plus

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.620
programming in 21 days.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.380
Probably not.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.580
Not so much that. Yeah.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.380
This was Hennessy and

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.220
Patterson and a bunch of

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.380
those books. So I was

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.260
talking with one of my

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.460
children the other day.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.520
Um, actually they were

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.720
listening to a podcast

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.440
and they were talking

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.480
about you are so cruel

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.960
to your kids. And I'm

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.280
leaving that statement in

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.000
the podcast.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.160
They think it's cool.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.520
They think Allen's cool.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.080
Yeah.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.400
So that you drug them

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.320
too. That's awesome,

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.600
Brent. Nice fathering.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.680
And they were surprised

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.720
cause there was

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.680
something you brought up.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.240
I think it was your

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240
music major. And they

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.040
were like, Allen's a

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.480
music major. I'm like,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.960
oh yeah. I mean, there

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.810
are, um, I don't know

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:17.770
what the stats are, but

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:19.290
there are just a ton of

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.170
people here that didn't

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.520
grow up through the

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.600
prescribed and defined

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.840
academic route.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.560
Yeah, there's a good

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.960
fraction of us that are

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.080
that way. It's still a

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.280
much harder route to go

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.400
through than going

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.160
through a computer

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.360
science degree, kind of

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.240
traditional route to

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.560
get here. Um, both

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.800
organizationally, like

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.280
it's hard to get

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.000
through the gauntlets. If

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.600
you don't have the right

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.040
degrees, um, and it's

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:44.640
hard to get the right

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.080
level of knowledge. Self

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:46.880
taught people tend to

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.760
have big gaps in their

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.720
knowledge a lot of

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.640
times. And so it's much

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.640
easier to have a better

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.360
sense of how everything

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.760
works together. Um, if

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.800
you, if you're forced to

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.520
learn all the pieces in

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.760
between, um, that usually

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.320
means you don't know the,

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.360
the details of any given

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.200
piece as much, but you

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:00.640
know how they work

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:00.960
together.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.000
The self taught people

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.540
today, um, the way I've

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.100
seen, I don't see a whole

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.300
lot of self taught people

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.900
today in the resumes

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.940
that I look at, but the

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:14.300
ones that I do see have

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.700
been, have a, a large

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.180
number of examples of

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:19.980
things that they've

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.140
shipped and applied.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.180
This goes back to what

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.260
Steve was talking about

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.660
earlier. I think the way

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.980
Steve and I self taught

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.500
ourselves gave us those

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.260
overviews that are missing

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.060
with the way people are

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.060
self taught today, which

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.020
is the just in time

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:32.780
learning of just a little

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.260
chunk here and there. So

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.460
I think it's more

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.940
difficult if you're

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.740
learning that way,

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.540
cause you really do need

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.340
that overview cause

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.340
systems thinking, whether

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.060
it's data science or

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.980
testing is so important.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.140
I think Joel Spolsky

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.580
used to talk about, uh,

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.940
he's created stack overflow.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.420
One of the guys who

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.260
created stack overflow.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.220
Um, and he's talked

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.180
about abstractions and

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.060
how abstraction layers are

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:52.500
useful, but they

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.300
always leak and you have

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.020
to understand the level

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.220
below that abstraction

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:55.820
layer. And I think the

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.140
problem with a lot of

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:57.980
today's learning models

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:58.700
is you only learn the

00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.220
top level of the

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.140
abstraction and you

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:00.700
don't learn anything

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.020
down below, you know,

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.060
and that, that shows,

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.140
I've seen people in

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:04.900
interviews that will

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:05.980
do things like they need

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.700
to concatenate two

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.460
numbers together. So

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.060
they will turn them into

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.620
strings, add the strings

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.420
together and then turn

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.340
them back into numbers.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.540
I'm like, yeah, that

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.580
works. But what, how much

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.420
work just happened in

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.500
the system in order to

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.740
make that simple thing

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.220
happen, you could

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.100
have multiplied by 10

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.820
and you know, added. And

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.020
instead you, you know,

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:21.740
did a whole bunch of

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.780
parsing and conversion

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.780
and then re parsing.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.060
Yeah. But you told me to

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.180
concatenate so I

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.380
concatenated. So

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.660
technically it got the

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.540
job done, but not in a

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.540
way that was, I'll

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.180
save the long

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.180
explanation so they can

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.140
get onto the bag. But

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.220
I'll just say this for

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:38.900
the first time in my

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.740
career, I'm working on

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.300
a team full of

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.420
JavaScript programmers.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.040
They're a different

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.280
breed. Yeah, they are.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.240
It's a trip that

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.960
they're at an

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.880
abstraction level way

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.640
higher than I've ever

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.340
worked with. Hey, it is

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.940
time. And I've never

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.500
done this in front of

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.340
anyone but Brent before.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:01.880
Mail bag.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.640
I always wondered if

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.440
you did that live or if

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.400
that was just in post.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.220
Apparently it's live.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.980
Live and a little

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.620
reverb later.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.020
It'd be good.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:09.980
Yeah. It's really hard

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.020
for him to get the

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.780
the reverb across.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.500
He's he's been

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.340
working on this for a

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.220
long time. Yeah.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.140
All right. So we

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.780
have two mail bag

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.100
questions. We'll see if

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:19.740
we can get both of

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.940
them. I'll go in order.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.140
And Brent wrote down

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:22.780
the names for me

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.700
because I always get

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.660
them wrong. So Abraham

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.420
Lincoln said,

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:28.820
no,

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.980
or score.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.780
And I memorized that

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.200
in seventh grade,

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.840
I think, and still have

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.600
like the first two or

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.480
three lines memorized,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.000
but I won't do them

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:41.640
today.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.840
Percy asks, where or how

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.840
do we start with this

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.960
data democratization thing?

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.720
That's the word Brent

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.480
made up last time.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.040
That's apparently

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.760
people had heard of.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.800
My company has BI

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.000
data and analytics group,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.120
but it seems that only

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.280
senior management are

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.560
the ones getting insight

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.480
from what information

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.420
they provide. So how

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.020
do you start?

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.300
I'll just bring it to

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.060
your word. How do you

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:05.820
start with this data

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:06.540
democratization?

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.660
Well, you sweet.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.780
I am retroactively

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.940
be going down as record

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.620
as the guy who

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.380
invented data democratization.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.500
That's fantastic.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.180
It's one of those time

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.060
travel movies where you

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:20.580
invented it in the

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.260
future and then brought

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:21.980
it to the past.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:22.460
Right.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.780
Just second, my mind

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.500
settle after that.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:27.050
Okay, go on.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.620
So Percy has a

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.820
situation where they

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.740
have a data science BI

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.700
team that essentially

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.500
services the executives

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.500
and he wants to know how

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.900
does he get into data

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:42.820
democratization?

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.000
Well, so the

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.320
data democratization

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.440
means you publish your

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.160
data, you make your

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.000
data available.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:51.840
I think he wants to

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.160
be a consumer of it.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.720
So what he needs to

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.400
do is start off with

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.200
what actions does he

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.720
want to improve the

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.320
productivity or efficiency?

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.280
He is a manager.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.320
What actions does he

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.100
want to take to improve

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.700
the productivity efficiency

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.780
of either his team or

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.780
his product?

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.460
So you start off with

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.420
what are the, where do

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.140
you think you can make

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.100
better decisions and

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.700
take stronger, faster

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.340
actions.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.380
Then what you do is you

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.380
go and you just talk

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.220
with that team, say,

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:26.620
hey, I have this

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.140
concrete situation that

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.540
I think you have the

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:31.300
data for.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.100
Do you?

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.820
If they don't, then

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:34.860
that's also going to be

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.820
a good team to get

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.060
advice from on the

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.300
data engineering front.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:40.980
In order for you to

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.060
democratize data, you

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.540
have to have the data.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.540
If your BI team has it,

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:49.210
then work with them

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:49.930
to figure out how to

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:50.410
share it.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:52.130
Now, I'll tell you, a

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.090
lot of these guys will

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.370
view themselves as, oh,

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:55.690
we were the guys that

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:56.730
build the scorecard for

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:57.490
the execs.

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.210
So you may need to be

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.130
willing to pony up

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.610
resources in order to

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:03.770
share that data.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.130
The thing is that most

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:05.770
of the data doesn't

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.130
exist. It's not created

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.930
by the BI team.

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:08.890
It's collected by the

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:09.370
BI team.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:09.650
Yep.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.010
So one possibility is to

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:11.850
go to the team that

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:12.450
they're collecting it

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.730
from and say, hey, you

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:14.610
have this database with

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:15.650
this information in it,

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.130
or you have this Hadoop

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:17.690
server with this

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:18.410
information in it, or

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:19.330
you have this, you

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:20.410
know, spreadsheet with

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:21.210
this information in it,

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:22.650
whatever your form of

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:23.690
information is, could

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:25.250
you please share that

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:26.530
out company wide or to

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:27.250
a much larger group of

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.250
people, you know, not

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.450
just me, because that

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:30.050
doesn't really, that's

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.970
not data democratization.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:31.850
If you say you have

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:32.370
this data, can you

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.370
share it with my team?

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.090
That's not really

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:34.970
democratizing things.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:35.650
That's making yourself

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:36.490
part of the special,

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:37.290
you know, part of the

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.730
elite. The better model

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.090
is to say, Hey, I need

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:41.930
access to this data.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:42.650
There's others that

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:43.650
probably do too. Could

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:44.210
you make it more

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:45.250
broadly available? Could

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.610
you lower the access

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:47.690
rights on that server

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:49.010
and start having that

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.290
conversation plus any

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:51.330
data that you control

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:52.850
demonstrate how it

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.090
works, make it openly

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:54.890
available. A lot of

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:55.370
times people are

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.650
scared to open their

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.890
data because what might

00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:58.850
happen if somebody gets

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.130
ahold of this. And I

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.050
think too often we

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.090
are, there's no

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:03.450
advantage to opening and

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:04.370
there might be some

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:05.410
risks somewhere, some

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.730
existential corner case

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.410
risk where we're like,

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:10.010
okay, I don't want to

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.930
share it because it might

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:11.810
cause, it might leak and

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.090
this might happen. And

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:13.570
oftentimes it's

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:14.330
overblown. And so I

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:14.970
think it should take a

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:15.770
little bit of risk, but

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:16.490
not much. And just,

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.240
the situation that I

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.240
encounter is, is I do

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.920
encounter that the teams

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.840
that I know that lock

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.440
their data, I would say

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.560
the primary reason is

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.440
because they know

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.000
there's a lot of

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.200
tribal knowledge baked in

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:28.920
and how to use it

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.720
correctly. And they

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.200
don't want to be

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.320
randomized by people

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.720
doing it wrong. Right.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.880
Which is why I

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.880
basically say what I

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.880
told earlier in this,

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.480
in this episode. I will

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.200
say that if you're

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.240
getting the data in

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.720
this, in this space,

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.360
you, you do want to,

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.280
so Steve is right. The

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.880
data is being gathered by

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.120
the BI team from some

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.160
place, but the BI team

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.960
most likely has already

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.160
done the work to clean

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.720
and check that data. And

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.640
to encode the tribe,

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.840
the correct tribal

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.080
knowledge, start there

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.040
first, see if they will

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.240
share it out. If they

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.400
don't, then yeah, you

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.520
may have to go back and

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.640
reinvent the wheel, but

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.160
you should figure out how

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.600
to make sure you can

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.840
bootstrap that domain

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.640
knowledge and not

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.000
reproduce it. Right. It

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
is always difficult. Data

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.960
democratization solves

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.800
the access to the data,

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.480
but doesn't solve the

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.160
ability to use it

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.720
correctly. Right. And so

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.800
it still really

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.280
requires a domain expert

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.000
in order to be able to

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.050
use it correctly. Agreed.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.450
Hey, we have two

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:34.530
male bait questions. We

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.410
do, but I only sing the

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:36.450
song once. Henry

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.130
Golding, who says, so

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:40.160
chaps, how long do you

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.440
think it will be before

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.360
data science becomes just

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.440
another tool in the

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.800
specializing generalist

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.640
box rather than a

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.640
separate thing you need

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.000
to spin up a big team of

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.680
specialists for, which I

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.920
think is a really

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.460
interesting question. I

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.740
will say, uh, my answer

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.500
for that is actually

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.580
pretty short. Um, it

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:01.620
ran. You have never had

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.580
a short answer for

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.540
anything in 46 episodes

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.220
of AB testing. I can't

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.300
wait. It will be a very

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.290
long time. The reason

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:14.440
why is, uh, data

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.960
scientists, uh, in the

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.360
tooling is advancing, but

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.080
the rate at which we're

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.480
acquiring tooling and

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.840
the rate at which we are

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.280
acquiring data science

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.360
is not keeping pace

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.840
with the rate at which

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.280
new data sources are

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:33.280
coming in and not keeping

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.880
pace with, with our need

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.480
to go deeper on data

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.920
science problems. So we

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.200
are currently just

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.840
scratching the surface and

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.480
we have a lot of

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.680
tooling. Um, but as more

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.840
and more data comes in,

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.360
we will have the need to

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.760
improve data engineering.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.440
There's this sense that,

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.000
uh, at least in my world,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.040
that there's a sense that

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.640
we're always six inches

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.010
just underneath the top

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.690
of the water. Yeah. I

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:05.570
think that you'll, it will

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.770
not go away and just

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:08.930
become a tool, but I

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:10.370
think it will become, I

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:10.970
think you'll always need

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:11.890
data scientists be pushing

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:12.530
the edge and to do the

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.530
more complicated things.

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:15.050
Um, for the primary

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:15.770
reason that the thought

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.210
processes of programming

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:18.170
and doing data science

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:19.330
are so different and the

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.330
knowledge bases are so

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:21.650
big that you can't keep

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:22.370
both of them. You cannot

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:23.290
be an expert in both at

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.650
the same time. That

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.810
said, I think that the

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:27.010
pieces of data science

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:27.850
will move more and more

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:29.410
easily into the basic

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:30.010
toolkit of your

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:30.890
generalizing specialists

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:31.490
and your specializing

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:32.810
generalists. Um, and so

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:33.610
they will be able to do

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.170
more and more parts of it,

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.170
but they won't be able to

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:37.170
do some of the more

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:37.930
advanced parts. And I

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:39.290
think what it defines an

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:40.010
advanced part and a

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:41.170
basic part will over

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:41.850
time, that boundary will

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:42.610
continue to move

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:43.490
forward. You know, it

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:45.640
used to be five years

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.360
ago, if you were data

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.480
science, you had to be a

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.800
PhD because you had to

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.520
go invent all your own

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.200
algorithms. If you

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.360
wanted to go, um, do, uh,

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.720
some deep learning, you

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.600
had to go invent your own

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.200
neural net and you had

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.400
to go know how a back

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.200
propagation worked and

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:57.840
all that kind of stuff.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.520
Today, you just go and

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.560
use the package in

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.000
Python or a package in

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.360
R or you go to Azure

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:03.960
machine learning and

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.800
you just say like, please

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.720
train a neural net for me

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.680
with, you know, 18

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.920
levels go and it will

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.200
just do it for you. Now,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.000
understanding what that

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:10.920
is doing and how to

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.160
tweak it is difficult,

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.600
but it's easier to go

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.400
do. And if I just want

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.640
to go figure out the

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.240
median for some values

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:17.840
or I want to go and

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.560
create like a simple

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.760
regression, it is very

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.600
easy to go do. And it

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.240
doesn't take a lot of

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.200
knowledge to be able to

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.400
go do the basic versions

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.320
of that. And that will

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.320
move over time up the

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.280
stack. Yes. And so what

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.480
we'll find is a lot of

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.240
that there'll be a

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.040
broadening that a lot of

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.360
the simple problems will

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.520
be readily automated

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.200
away. But to Henry's

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.320
question, there probably

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.040
will be, I don't know,

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:41.840
I'll just make up a

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.960
number five years from

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.720
now that the tooling

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.520
will exist that the

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.800
generalizing specialists

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.560
or specializing

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.400
generalists will be

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.080
able to solve 80% of

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:51.800
the problems. And there

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.760
will be environments

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.880
where solving 80% of

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.000
the problems is

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.160
sufficient. I think all

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.000
the years of today's

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.880
problems. But I think,

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.160
yeah, as always, you'll

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.080
get to more and more

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.120
complex problems as you

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:01.800
can solve the easy

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.000
problems. It will depend

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.360
on on the competitive

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.760
advantage like it. The

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.800
as right now we're all

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.000
competing on the basis

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.720
of speed in the world.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.520
And I think once

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.640
everyone is kind of

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.200
going at the same pace,

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:15.720
then there's going to

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.480
be other things that

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.520
that are the

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.640
differentiator in the

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.880
market. And I think

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.400
that's where the deep

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.200
data scientists will

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.640
come into play. I think

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.860
you're both wrong. Not

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.500
totally wrong. I think

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.020
I think there's another

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:29.900
spin on it that I'll get

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.660
to before I run out of

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.020
time. I think both

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.300
happen. You guys are

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.300
talking right. I sit

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.300
back and listen. It's

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.020
like you're talking

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.940
like Microsoft data

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.620
scientists. But

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:40.540
remember, if I'm on a

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.260
team of 20 people

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.420
making some cool app,

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.100
absolutely. There's a

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:46.860
twist on Henry's

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.140
question. I need you're

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:48.940
not going to have a

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.740
data scientist on the

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:50.620
team probably in 20

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.660
people, maybe not even

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.220
40 people. But you

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.700
absolutely as part of

00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:55.820
a team of specializing

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.740
judge generalizing

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.820
specialists, you need

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.660
someone with some data

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.540
science chops, someone

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.140
who's gone through a

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:00.860
couple of course, not a

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:01.900
man, an expert, not a

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.540
PhD for sure, but gone

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.100
through the course or

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.980
classes, you know, read

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.020
lean analytics. For

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.180
example, they have some

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.500
idea of what to do. This

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.100
is the role I play a

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:12.980
lot on my team. So I

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.740
can advocate a little

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.140
bit there is I am not a

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.500
data scientist. I know

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:18.460
enough about it that I

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:19.020
can tell them we're

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.340
doing stupid things or

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:20.860
where there's things

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:21.700
that were obviously

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.580
needed to be doing. We

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.580
are now ramping up with

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.460
some data science people

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.620
in the org to help cover

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:28.300
some of the things that I

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.820
can't get to. But I think

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:32.140
you need both. At some

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.020
point, you may need a

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.140
team of data scientists

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.660
we as you get bigger,

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:36.580
and you're making more

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.180
impact, you have more

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.540
data coming in. But

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.380
absolutely, I wouldn't

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.900
say I wouldn't say

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.820
there'll be a time when

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.300
I think the time when

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:45.580
data science needs to be

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.300
a tool in your toolbox

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:47.980
is now.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:48.900
Right. I think the

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.220
time when it's only

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.100
tool in your toolbox,

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:51.580
and you don't have

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.700
specialists is a long

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:53.140
ways away.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:54.940
But I think it's

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:55.860
becoming more and more

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:56.660
democratized.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:57.540
There's a subtle

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.180
every year.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.340
I think it becomes a

00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.500
tool now. It'll be. And

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.380
so I want to make that

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.490
point. But I think

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.170
definitely it's probably

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:08.970
never just that,

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.010
especially, it'll

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:12.090
always be with scale,

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:12.970
but it'll always be

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:15.490
moving on. So I'll

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.010
invent another new term

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:17.530
today.

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:18.970
This is Brent's

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:20.090
continuing short answer.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.650
Expert systems. So an

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:24.610
expert system is a new

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:26.930
newish asset in which

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.370
you apply data science,

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:30.450
automation, machine

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:32.010
learning, and you apply

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:33.650
in a rigorous fashion

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:35.090
domain knowledge from

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:36.170
particular teams.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:37.810
And I will say, for

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:40.530
example, 60% of what I

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.530
do is analyzing

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.210
histograms. And there's

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:46.730
a very succinct period

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:48.610
or a rigor around how

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:49.410
I do that, what I

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:51.610
discover. And that's, I

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.690
would say, readily

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:54.250
automatable. Right.

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.330
So once an expert

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.090
system or something

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:58.250
similar comes into play

00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:59.170
that can generate these

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.090
things, do the

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.330
if conditions determine

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:05.890
what further analysis

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:06.730
needs to be done and

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.930
then output, go do

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.330
this. This is what appears

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:11.210
to be the problem.

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.050
I think that's

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:15.490
certainly doable in the

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:16.130
next five years.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:17.370
And there's tools that

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:18.050
are making it easier and

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:18.770
easier all the time. Like

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.330
the new version of

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.610
Excel has histograms built

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.650
in in a reasonable way,

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:22.490
which it never has had

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.130
before. Power BI is now

00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:25.250
fairly democratized.

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:25.930
You know, there's other

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:26.650
platforms out there that

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:28.050
you can use to analyze

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:29.050
your data and get a lot

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:30.570
of sense for it just

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:31.170
from the beginning with

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:32.370
it with very easy tools

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:32.730
to use.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:33.970
Very cool. Hey guys,

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:34.810
we're out of time.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:36.290
Hey, thanks Steve, which

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:38.390
means shut up. Thanks

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:39.110
Steve for coming.

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:40.790
Yeah. I guess you just

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:41.430
showed up anyway.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.290
It does. If I didn't

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:46.530
show up, you would

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:47.970
have been what?

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.290
As testing? What's that

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:50.090
ass testing?

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:53.570
You need me. All right,

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.130
then. All right, I'm

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:56.330
Alan. I'm Brent.

00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:57.490
And I am neither.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.440
Awesome. See you next

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.360
time. Bye guys.
