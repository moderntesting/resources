00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:11.620
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.900
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show boom

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.220
Whoop there it is that was the sound of 134

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.560
episode 134 of the AV testing podcast hitting your podcast player

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.340
Because I finally got almost

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.940
Almost everyone switched over to the new feed for some reason of course if you're on the old feed

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.900
you're not getting any new episodes, but I had like

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.920
11 or 15 or some small number of plays still last week from the old feed like they were catching up. I

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.680
Like that as a as a model for the model for the podcast a be testing podcast where we almost get it right

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.360
Sometimes maybe hey

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.280
Perfect is the enemy of good right it it is have you ever heard of the 8080 rule the 8080 rule

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280
No, what is the 8080 rule?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.200
8080 rule is 80% of the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.920
value comes from 80% of the effort the other 80% of the value comes from the remaining

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.960
20% of the effort I know you're a math guy

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.200
And you're gonna think about that and it's gonna make sense someday

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.240
What do you think I'm sticking by the 8080 rule all right?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.600
We're gonna go with that and that is not going to be anything. I call out in the show notes, which uh, so yeah

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.120
We are here recording on a Friday afternoon on Friday Friday Friday

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.840
Friday

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.760
Freddowary the only thing I'm drinking is a tall can of cold brewed coffee

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.040
Friday February 19th should be out on Monday

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880
next Wednesday

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.030
Do it a webinar?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550
Yeah

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.830
Yeah, and I'm talking about a lot of you remember an article

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.350
I posted on blog test project that I owe about a month ago on the developer versus a tester mindset and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.430
How I thought that was crap and we talked about that on a podcast probably 132. I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.510
Think and I'm giving a webinar talking about that. It's a real

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.590
Multimedia experience of the article I wrote with more examples

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.110
Of course, the audience is all going to be testers and I imagine the audience will all be there with pitchforks

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.390
So, you know should be a good time. Yeah in here as a as a as a tease

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.870
Alex or Alex that's my son's name Alan

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.540
My god, I'm old

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.540
Alan is is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.020
Finally going to show support for checking

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:08.120
I'm not even that that was such a poorly baited hook. I'm not even gonna think of biting

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.740
People are very subtle. I get direct messages on LinkedIn from folks saying your article is misleading

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.920
Because it mentions the word testing when you really mean checking it's can and I am not

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.520
Kidding they my latest article I just posted again on blog test project that I owe about

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.600
Test automation which is pretty much the written version of our last podcast more or less with some

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.520
Better grammar and spelling if you can misspell during a podcast. We would know how to do it

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.500
anyway, the title was the title had the word test in it and

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.330
They pinged me and said this article is not about testing. It's about test automation

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.450
You should call that out and I did a quick little search and I replied back and I said

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.370
Did you notice that the article has the word test automation or automated test?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.220
40 does is not a made-up exaggerated podcast name. I counted 40 instances in a 1200 word article

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.760
I think it's clear that the article was about test automation and the day I call it check automation

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.160
Actually is never the only way that could happen is if I died and someone reanimated me as an evil robot

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.680
So anyway, that's my life

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.760
So I'm doing the webinar I will handle the pitchforks gracefully and again this goes back to episode one of the A B testing

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
I'm not dictating

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.480
That this is all going to change and neither is Brent

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.800
We're here to help people navigate the change the webinar folks are really excited to have me do it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.400
There's good. It was their ideas to do the webinar and they said hey and be a little careful because our audience is testers

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.320
And I will be of course, but it's about

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.280
Letting just giving them information to help them navigate the change to itty bitty bits of information to share about the podcast

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.280
One is the webinar

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.660
None of this planned not in my notes

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.760
One is that this is test project the test automation project

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.880
Or program which I've used in the past. I did some blog posts on it a while back. It's super easy to use

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.880
It's it's a nice platform

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:28.760
I have subtly hinted both in my last article and in talking to these folks they should market these tools towards developers and not just testers and

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.280
They are that is in their plans. They're gonna start marketing harder to developers. I think it's great

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.800
I think tools like cypress and test cafe do already and I think all of the test tool

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.120
Vendors in the industry should market a little more heavily

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:53.480
Towards developers in fact, I don't know if I've mentioned I am good friends with the folks at autofie who make yet another

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.240
Recorded test automation will make our test not flaky via via ML and AI

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.840
Basically just to find out when it works pretty well

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.040
It's it makes me much less afraid of UI automation, but they have companies come to them and

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.400
Say they want to do. Oh, yeah, we want to do a whole bunch of automation

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.880
They go these guys they get it because they're developers

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.460
They're trying to market to developers and testers and teams say hold on hold on hold on

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.780
No, no, just you you shouldn't do that

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.520
You should write a whole bunch of tests that don't need web UI

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.840
Verification and just use this for the things that can only be tested using web UI verification

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.360
Anyway, we've been on that

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:44.590
Hill before the other thing is test project was acquired a year ago six months ago by a larger company called Tricentis

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.450
Not heard of it. Okay. Well, that is if you go look at I think the last James Buck

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.110
post to web post from

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.350
Roughly a year ago. He was going to work at Tricentis. I don't know if he's still there

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.690
He's been pretty quiet and generally he gets quiet when he's busy working

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.010
So he could be very much so still working there. I don't know if they'll show up at my

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.170
Podcast a heckle, but I actually don't care if he does because I don't think he'll have anything to argue with them what I say

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:23.400
But wanted to mention all that small world small world. Okay one more rant if you don't mind then we can do the topic for

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.400
The day. Yeah, or do you actually want to say anything?

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.880
Or so I didn't tag you on Twitter, but and we're not video cast haven't done that in a while

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.440
Maybe we'll do it again sometime

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.300
But I did I did send out an Instagram and a tweet

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.780
Insta in a tweet right before we recorded and you guys can't see me but Brent

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.420
I can't see his face because he's had his hand over his face the whole time

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.500
but he is clean shaven and I in their hand have stopped shaving completely and

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I think if all goes well

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.900
We kick Brent off of the podcast and the B and AB testing begins to stand for Alan's beard

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.770
Let's be me and my beard. I'm practicing why I'm monopolizing the recording time

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.140
Yeah, I I think that's a

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.260
Potentially a great way to boost listenership

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.880
right, I

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.880
your beard is

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.320
clearly very wise

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.100
Clearly clearly makes me look older and smarter. Hey, I have a question for you. Yeah, this is a multiple choice question

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.600
You're good at these. We've done this before. All right, here we go

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.120
what false assumption should you be aware of when striving for continuous quality a

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.360
Quality should be assured by tests conducted by a dedicated team

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:56.080
B quality is primarily a marketing asset and yields few other benefits or

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:04.760
See the more bugs that are found and fixed the better the quality. Oh my god

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.000
Is is D none of the above wait say B again

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.800
Quality is primarily a marketing asset and yields few other benefits

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.950
and then a

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.940
Quality should be assured by tests conducted by a dedicated team

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.160
Well with I mean all of those options suck, but if I have to pick one I'll pick B

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.880
All right. Well, you're your friends at Microsoft who made this little quiz

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.720
Said that C is the correct answer that that's a fault that the more bugs that are found and fixed about other the quality is

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.120
The false assumption about continuous quality therefore. Oh, therefore the others others must be true

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:56.950
It's a very confusing question. I wanted to highlight that it gets gets the WTF of the day. Yeah

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.550
It really is missing a all of the above option

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.740
It is exactly right. Hey, so today on the podcast

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:14.270
Did you where's the link to that? Where's the link to that thing? I just have the graphic and it's in

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:20.550
One of the three dot slack comm you can join by going to modern test new or clicking on the link and it's in the Rance

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.440
Channel where lots of folks post

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.040
It's tough that pisses them off

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.570
Okay, well Brent lives at go you guys this come out

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:38.120
You won't you will have to talk to Yost? That's all I can say. That's all I know. I saw it today

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.360
It was worth reading you need to do your research ahead of the podcast

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.920
I have books all over my table at websites open. I have done my research

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.880
I'm also lying

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.480
Absolutely, you're lying. I'm like do the research before the podcast

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.020
We we don't know the topics until five minutes after the podcast has started one of my favorite

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.160
lines ever in comedy is from

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.090
John Mulaney I

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.090
Won't go it. I won't tell the whole story

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.130
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. I said no

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.730
You know like a liar

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.380
Okay, some reason that line just I just love it sticks in my head all the time

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.380
I lie which I guess is good

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.220
Or it means I lie a lot

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.900
So anyway topic and if you're gonna you're gonna be eating through the whole podcast or just like during part of the recording

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.870
I think in the whole one is that is that I mean there are

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.950
Seven days a week all of these like 20

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.230
One hour for one hour in two weeks of time

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:47.250
I ask you to not be shoving crap in your face, but no I can't do a man

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.030
It's too hard

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:59.770
Further further evidence for for this whole beard program. Hey, so uh, we always we frequently we frequently use

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:06.890
Stuff Alan's doing at work to talk about to delve into topics that are seem relevant for the three

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:13.550
But I want to use talking about what you do at work to talk about what I do at work to benefit the three

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:19.870
Because I don't think well, I think the three probably can describe what I do at least what my responsibilities are pretty well

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.350
All they know is Brent sits in a desk and does math

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:31.490
Like what is your role you manage a data science team? Is that correct? Yeah, and is it all top secret stuff?

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.130
You can't talk about and that's fine

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.650
But what does like what are the outputs of your team who consumes your stuff?

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.050
Tell tell tell the three a little bit more

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.230
Under the appropriate NDA on what you do

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.180
So I have

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.420
two key missions

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.100
One is

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.660
Essentially

00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:01.060
We have customers who are in pain. We have customers who have problems and

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.900
That that second mission is around

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.850
How do we apply?

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:15.250
so my my portion of that mission is the is the application of data science with the goal of

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.010
the

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.890
match making solutions to problems

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.000
as as soon as possible in the user's

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.580
journey on the platform

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:38.350
So is there a not is there a fair to share example of that you can share well

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.790
So the other thing I was gonna say is so my team is a much further along

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.950
on that mission than my second mission and

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.720
We actually own and operate

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.000
Microservices where that are ml powered that plug into

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:06.960
particular elements of the portal of the Azure portal itself so one one aspect for example if you if you're on Azure and

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.760
You go and and create a support ticket

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.240
You begin the process to create a support ticket

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.920
There's a system that will give you a recommendation as to

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.520
What topic you're actually?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.760
should should move forward with the very very first pain in the wizard is sort of

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.480
specifying the the topic that sort of

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.070
encapsulates the problem space and

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.460
That's a that that service is entirely my team

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.380
There's there's another one that we operate that

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:58.810
Helps so in the case. I'm actually trying to decide if this is an NDA thing

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.590
Yeah, it is

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:09.510
We have another service that when customers have a certain type of problem. We give them we give them a very concrete and

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.980
direct

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.140
alternative

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.140
to them they they there's a specific problem that they could face and

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:24.400
There's there's no way to move forward in their ideal scenario, so we are able to

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.760
give them an alternative to what they were doing and

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.240
That second one the first one is great because I ran a

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.300
essentially a small little team and

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.820
That one is the first one is a very tight scenario and

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.620
But my team is very proud of it because we are operating at

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.180
Microsoft scope and and helping to solve Microsoft level problems

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.910
the second one

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.990
Is a real customer bummer?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:09.880
It's it's it's in terms of Azure itself. It's a rather rare event

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.600
but in terms

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.960
But it does happen daily and

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.740
This particular that one has actually helped to

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.180
To get customers a faster solution and able to move forward

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.860
and

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.660
directly reduced

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:38.100
The number of cases the support cases for that particular problem by 40% oh

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:46.300
That's all that that's great. So yeah, most of your stuff it sounds like from you talking about you can correct me if I misinterpreted this but it is

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:55.060
Not customer visible directly, but it's it's stuff that runs in production that actually runs behind the scenes to help other stuff work

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.980
It's it's or is it internal that that was unclear to me

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.720
So all of the services that we're operating right now and again

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.320
It's the two and we have a couple more about to ship

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:15.760
There they're behind highly secured rest API's. Okay, so so yeah, but the

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.650
the user visible components

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.410
Will directly show the results in a more user

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.770
Friendly way, but it is a rest API. I'm not I'm not generating the UI or whatever

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.050
API is accessible by customers as well as internal developers

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.200
The rest API directly is not we're very tight on on

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.200
Controlling who who gets to call it?

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:47.400
All right, so you are and and the reason for my precision questioning is the topic I wanted to get to is talk about

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.720
Orgs like test orgs like the org I run like the org you run that

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.640
We exist to help other parts of the org be successful. Is that statement? Correct?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:07.300
Does that high level description of both of our orgs put us in the same part of the Venn diagram if you'd asked me two years ago

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:14.060
That I would have immediately said yes, as you as you know Alan I think

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:19.380
The denocides fad is at the beginning of the end. Mm-hmm. Okay, and

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.620
As you also know when it comes to career

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.170
chained events

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.810
I tend to start I stand to start doing that shift

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.890
much sooner than most others

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:45.170
And in the coordinates, this is why I a data science team and operating to production services

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:54.320
So I am I don't know if you would put a development organization as part of that support organization

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.760
I guess if it were a tool developer, it's a little different. I'm stretching a little bit

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:04.200
It's a little bit different than what an infrastructure or a site reliability engineering team do in my case

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.520
Yeah, a non-trivial portion of my duties are in a supportive role. It's my job to generate insights

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.800
That force other people to do things. Okay, so very close

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:23.050
We have teams that aren't in my org that do similar sorts of things for our business as you could imagine

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.690
Not not at Microsoft scale. They do it at unity scale

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:32.370
Agreed, let me move on to my original topic. I think there'll be some relevance to what you're doing

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:38.410
But of course you've of course you've run test teams in the past which I think very much fall into this bucket

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.970
Your your goal as a test team isn't to find bugs

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.810
It isn't to write a bunch of automated tests

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:53.610
It isn't to run code coverage is to accelerate the achievement a shippable quality or accelerate the team's ability to ship or as principle one says

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.610
Well cellophane correctly in the background or as principle one says

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.950
Business value

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.230
business first

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:11.020
right, so I'm curious you've run test teams a lot and you've run orgs like this and of course as

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:18.460
Probably as far back as Xbox one is when I first sort of fell into a role or a

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.380
Purely support role where I wasn't testing. You know what?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:28.080
I realized for all the work I've done in testing. Do you know when the last time that my job was to do testing even?

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.820
70% of my day

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.780
Windows windows. No, it was Windows

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:41.540
2000 yeah mine was it was in called NT 5 at the time but that was my last time I did full-time testing

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.880
Yeah for me was schedule plus

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.040
Right with ships with office 95

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.870
Right because I went from I see the manager relatively quickly in my career

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.060
The

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.620
but hindsight

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.780
2020

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.140
And I don't want to the given in the context

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:09.420
And I've shared this over and over again, right? I've kind of always shied away from

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.100
roles

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:18.740
That were were too heavily focused on testing because because quite honestly the process of

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.260
testing was

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.380
Awful. Well, what happened with me and this is a little off-topic

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.060
But I I enjoyed doing the testing but then after a while I

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.020
enjoyed

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.620
Helping others get better and faster at it. So even I gotta think where I went from there

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.820
So I was testing full-time there and then I joined the windows and millennium team

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.780
And I did debugger development just because it was hard and fun and worked on debug windows and ended up

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.700
I don't think I wrote any tests. I was pretty much full-time

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.060
debugging and

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.980
Doing some of the kernel dev probably why it sucked so much and after that I

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.620
Windows CE I was a test architect there

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.620
I helped others get stuff done. I ended up running the tools team there

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.940
I owe I managed some testers, but I just let them do their stuff. I mainly worked on tool development

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:13.060
And of course, I went to engineering excellence and taught testing. I that's where I really studied testing

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.160
That's where I learned testing as when I had to study it so I could teach it

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.220
And then yeah, and then after that it was more test architecti kind of stuff on link and then

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.620
Definitely running the internal tools project as I did in Xbox, etc, etc, etc

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:34.220
And these days just running teams that support a larger part of the company or the organization

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.860
Yeah hindsight 2020 like and I've said this on the podcast before

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:46.060
Like I was never really into testing right? I was far more interested in

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.510
quality and

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.440
Yeah, hey, I said, yeah, I want to underscore that's the thing

00:22:53.440 --> 00:23:00.220
I think that that will end any argument on testing versus checking or so. I don't give a shit. I care about quality

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.660
I don't care like the craft is exciting as long as it leads towards customer quality

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.820
Right. And of course, of course

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:16.380
There is the semantic, you know piggybacking off of episode one hundred and three therein lies the semantic

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.100
problem

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.860
right because

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.480
In the camp that's pushing back on your article on the mindset discussion

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.400
They don't see a world where quality and testing are anything other than synonyms and

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
and I

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.600
Don't know I used to have a great set of skills around this

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.440
Right. I have the one blog post

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.040
That actually raised a lot of eyebrows

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.520
in and got people to surf source

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:56.840
Basically rethink it where but and then I don't know if you remember but I had a mentor back in the day and I'm like

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.840
Hey, why is it?

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.130
that

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:07.370
We don't see test people from tests back when we had the functional roles here at Microsoft. We see tests ascending to

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:13.930
To the product unit manager role all that often and his answer was like, oh my god

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.290
That's like one of the simplest questions ever

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:23.770
It's it's simply because the cussed the test doesn't understand the customer and back in those days

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.330
Thems were fighting words. Yeah. Yeah

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:31.210
We are the customer man with a last line of defense

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:40.320
Right. Exactly. We're the the customer advocate him, right and I go through that story and I sat back to him and

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.020
I walked through that story and I and set back and you know

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.740
I was getting ready to bit flip him as a mentor. This was actually our first meeting

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.660
I won't tell it here

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.180
Maybe we put a link into the blog post in the show notes

00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:03.580
But what resulted is I of course then had a huge community of peers that were also test managers

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.580
And I'm like, you know what? I

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:16.420
Realized this dude's fucking right. I've I've been having my head up my own ass on this for forever

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:22.830
And then I would share the story with the other test manager and I'm like, look, this is my perspective now

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:27.370
And I can't I can't unsee it tell me where I'm wrong, right?

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:32.010
And this is why and I'm gonna go off here because as you all may recall

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.410
Regardless of our seventh principle, which says you may not need testers and don't you mean checkers?

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:41.950
No, the most controversial as far as angry feedback

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:48.110
We've had on the principles is the one where we say only the customer knows how to evaluate the quality of our products

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:55.530
Which is absolutely right and I get it the feedback we get when and again, we are not dictating this

00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:03.870
This is us and our love and our study of Eric Reese and seeing how it works to actually get feedback and ship incrementally and get feedback

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.330
from from people actually using the product

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.510
via data

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.950
What we see of anyway common down Brent

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:20.690
But the idea is we don't know we just don't know how they use our stuff until we can see them use it or

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.930
study how they use it through data and the idea that

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:30.450
test is there to act as the customer and be the customer and the subject matter expert for the feature is

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:36.250
Just a bunch of crap and I can tell you because you and I can both probably think of software that

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:44.210
We tested the shit out of it's very functionally correct and users can't figure out how to use it, right?

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.220
because

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.400
the problems we're trying to solve is

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:58.660
Spec correctness as our friend Steve called out in his follow-up blog to the put to my post

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.020
He's like yeah, we've been spending all over time

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:06.860
Focusing on spec correctness and making sure the spec was implemented to the letter

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.820
But right no one's no one's worried about

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.100
Does the customer care so I gotta tell you once I wrote I?

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:21.540
Wrote and for Windows 98 some network API tests that not only

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:28.300
Created shares of every allowable length. I'm I use some equivalence classes, but also

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.180
every character

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.180
That was possible on a win 9x machine

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.850
Japanese Korean Chinese, etc, etc, etc

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:44.890
and I ran all those tests I found a couple bugs, but it was a huge huge huge huge suite

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.690
It ran forever. It was super reliable because it was API level. It wasn't done through the UI and

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:56.530
Does that mean those network APIs had no bugs? No, I I just ran a lot of tests

00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:00.770
I probably had good code coverage, but I in hindsight as dumb

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.500
Yeah, there's a lot of things

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:09.760
The other thing too though is I think back. What is that? Hold on. Hold on. Yeah, there's a lot of things

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:16.880
What does that mean? I was trying to shift into an empathetic moment

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.040
Where where you and I walked away feel more connected and bonded together. That's not gonna happen

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.900
My beard's in the way

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:31.800
I think through like those days and and I don't know about you but I'm

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.240
Part of me is actively repressing those days and as a result

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.560
I'm forgetting the other constraints right a lot of the things that we did back then

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.580
We're due to the fact that we're shipping

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.020
We we were shipping very slow. Yeah

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.260
I remember

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.540
Under a year was considered a fast release

00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:01.190
Right. We had no choice. We had no choice. I know I know it's a different world and we need to adapt. Oh

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.740
I'm there

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.690
Customers get quality

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:18.010
We in support orgs test included. I think you know, what's really fun is I can tell you my team's mission and

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:25.280
You might I might have to pay a copyright tax to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:32.080
No, it's better. So remember for me. I manage all of our infrastructure site reliability engineering

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.400
documentation

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.480
Quality coaches. Yes. We have quality coaches. Remember we used to measure ratio

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.980
Well our ratio of quality coaches and developers is about one to a hundred your mileage may vary those are all on my team

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:54.620
Some other stuff too. I'm sure I'm forgetting but all of the stuff that helps other parts of the company ship services and

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.900
Mission to enable enable the success of developers at Unity and delivering high value products our customers love

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.920
So we are they we are there to enable success

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:13.120
It's not even enable success, right? Like don't fool you. It should be accelerate success

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.300
Right, right. I mean by saying enable success like the thought exercise that you

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:26.420
You can do the word enables there because there's a there's a division or organizational mission statement

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.460
Which starts with the navel that I wanted to build on but you're correct

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.620
Oh, all right

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:36.100
I'll just say this I'll just finish the thought like if you use the word enable then you you

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:44.300
Right it the implication is that if your organization wasn't there, right? You are correct that success wouldn't happen

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.300
And that's probably false

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.490
however

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:56.730
Your job because you're there is is to accelerate that success. All right in this world where speed wins

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.810
That's the reason to

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:05.210
Get an orb like yours in-house. We want to make it easy fast and safe. Yes

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.860
Easier faster safer. I'll work on that

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.500
But so but that's very similar to what test did back at the day back before we had CICD

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.220
Because you don't need it when you're shipping once every two years

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:26.620
We did a lot of things we did testing of course, we tried the test quality in we played bug ping pong all the time

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:33.380
But also we were doing we were involved in bug triage try and find the right bugs to fix trying to get rid of

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.900
We did a lot of other little things and tools and

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.980
Diagnostic things to help with that

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.140
Yeah, I'm still

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.140
You're a damn test harness

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:50.360
Yeah, where you know it up you should have marketed that purely to developers and said testers don't write these here you go

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.720
Yeah, that would actually have been smart

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.100
Yeah

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.620
Architected that got a patent on it. I just

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.460
And then I wrote a right the way I deployed it usage actually

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.580
Made that code dependency loop. We talked about so often

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.940
Way more efficient man. Did we did that tool?

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:22.700
Solidify codependency like anything else I've ever seen the lesson I've learned that helps with my org

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.340
One get their job done and scale across the company

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:31.700
But to just job satisfaction is nobody has ever put in a position where

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.460
Another team or a person is dependent on them to get their job done

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:43.730
Like everywhere from docs like we have developers are a lot of documentation. Of course, then we can polish it and edit it on the

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.650
Deployment side everyone we have the you build that you run it

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:53.650
We just make it easier for you to build it and run it easier built easier faster safer to build it and run it

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:58.370
Yeah, the thing so winding back to the high-level topic and we kind of got there

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.490
But the thing like I think in a support organization

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:07.650
And you made a comment hey back in the day test tried to make it easier faster safer I

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.850
May be safer like easier and faster

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:19.540
No, we did not know we enjoyed being the bottleneck. It was part of the codependency

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.900
We'll get this we have to sign off

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.360
Yeah

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.680
Yeah

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:36.000
Remember Boyd Boyd on Xbox once sat me down. We're having a conversation. He told me, you know

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.040
Yeah, he's doing is it kind of hippie thing

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.340
What is the role of test and I fished around for some answers to accelerate the achievement of quality?

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:52.280
No, that's not it to provide information to stakeholders. No, that's not it. The rule of that one is to sign off

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.360
But well, that's a shitty answer Boyd

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.460
Yeah

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.300
Cool so if I sign off right now

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.700
You know get can I just you know drink beer in my office?

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:11.020
I gotta tell you just this week in one of my one-on-ones one of my employees were talking about the org

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.700
I can't remember what we were talking about we I

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:22.020
One of the things in just a tangent to the tangent and the one-on-ones there. I still have people who

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.240
Want to talk about status what they did and I don't care

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:35.430
Let's talk about let's talk about stuff that makes us think so usually usually I steer away pretty quickly and they kind of get it

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:40.590
I've only once had to say in a one-on-one. I don't want to talk about status

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.170
Usually they get it pretty quickly, which is great

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.750
but we were talking about what's going on in the org and some strategic sort of stuff and

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:55.710
This is a a person on my team and he said well, basically we're a cost center for the org

00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:02.110
Let's not think of it that way. Let's think of us as a business accelerant

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:09.760
well, right and so once you once you realize rephrasing principle one because I think it applies to you a

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.520
a

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.560
DevOps or infra org just as much as it did test back in the day

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.830
We're an accelerant for the org

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:26.110
But one it's important that you you recognize that role like if you're in a support role

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.030
In this particular case in your team

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:38.150
It's not all support roles are gonna be an accelerant I think but in your case and in my prior test case

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.470
Or test management career case and as we mentioned some degree even today

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.670
My job is to accelerate this the achievement of shipable

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:52.950
Quality and once you realize that you're an accelerant and that your whole value proposition is

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:58.390
Acceleration then you can begin going down the path of defining for your organization

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.990
What is the work you should be working on in some sort of return on investment?

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:09.590
Oh, yeah, and and the answer the discussion that that we the subsequent conversation

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.070
again

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.070
faster better quick what I say

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.070
faster

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.200
Faster

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.440
Better faster safer. Jeezus. I'm dumb easier faster safer

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:28.840
I said, well, how long does it take for what's our pipeline time like and I know the answer

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.440
It's super fast like our longest one if everything goes wrong is about 40 minutes

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:42.200
But most most most the time emerged to emerge to Maine and it's live within 20 minutes. Okay. Yeah

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.040
We can always tweak the bottle neck. He said yeah, we're already fine there. What can we do? So should we speed that up?

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.040
I said no, but let me ask you this

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.620
When we hire someone brand new person in the org how long until they're fully productive on the team?

00:36:54.620 --> 00:37:00.980
Oh, yeah, we could and right now. I don't know what the number is anecdotally. We can ask managers. It is not good

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:06.260
Measured in months. I would say my guess is measured in months

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.660
We know anecdotally at least it's we can do better there

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:15.260
So this let's do that. You know, you and I could brainstorm and think of 20 things we could do today

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.700
To make that better. Let's start measuring that get that faster

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:25.350
Theory of constraints you have to which and systems thinking go together. You have to look at the system that figure out

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:32.070
Okay, where's our biggest bottleneck? So if you look back like I mean, it's slow. Let's look at the whole process even beyond

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.870
The systems is always a system within a system. So

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.790
Today I have an open head count. It may take me

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.750
some amount of time to get

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:50.790
a job wreck in with recruiting and get that posted and go through resume feedback and interviews

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:55.510
And then get them to quit their old job to start and that there's some time lag there

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.470
That's all part of a larger system

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.910
So I want to make that faster too

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.030
But the first thing we can do is just make the whole on boarding faster

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.990
But if you look at the system

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:09.030
You're going to find other things that are slow. What are the things that don't make it?

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.390
What are the things that make it more difficult to be?

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.270
Easy fast and quick

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:21.030
That's a key thing. That's a key thing for me. Like I'm still focusing on

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:26.390
So I have two phases. The first thing is okay before they even started

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.710
How do I reduce ramp up time to near zero?

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.310
Yeah

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:40.390
Yeah, that that's number one and my definition of ramp up time is essentially the idle period before they start doing something useful

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.980
okay, am

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.460
then the second phase is

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:53.540
Is how do I get them to autonomy as quickly as possible?

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.530
Autonomously capable would be better. Yeah

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.090
I'm sure there are some some

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:06.090
Good survey questions we can ask because our org does sort of an end-set survey twice a year to figure out

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:12.250
How developers are doing but we could shove that in there, but I just thinking a perfect world imagine this

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.410
imagine this

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:21.450
Uh, we get our interview process streamlined enough that if we like somebody we can give them an offer at the end of the day

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.910
And they are shipping meaningful code

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.160
On their first day at work

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.600
That's I mean, I like the idea the big hair audacious goal

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.840
Just say that's the goal if you fall a little short you're still in pretty good shape, but that's what I want to do

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:43.640
I just decide no, I I want off offers on the days of the day of the interview and I want them shipping meaningful code

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.370
on their first day

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.890
and and

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.250
Like rallying cries are super effective. And if you just say look

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.970
Offer by end of day. That's what I want offer by the end of the day

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.660
Right, and if you don't set

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.300
A clear simple goal like that

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.740
obviously

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.900
If you never start you're never going to get there

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.660
Right. And so that's just setting deep deep. Right? I know

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.580
right

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.380
It's it's sadly a phrase I use

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.180
at least once a week

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.900
right, it's because there's a

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:26.070
There's still a lot of push and not push but

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.950
a lot of people

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.950
uh in the company I work in

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.830
uh that are still

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:41.580
You know the big design up front is safer. Yeah. Yeah, it's the way it's it's the way it's always been it's easier

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.380
It's what they're comfortable with. Yeah, and i'm just like

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.420
So now I actually have a reputation

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.360
So i'm out actually allowed

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:55.080
I can do things I couldn't do even just took all the years ago. I'm like, okay

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.160
Well, i'm not interested in investing in that then

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:03.160
They're like what i'm gonna give you eight heads. Yeah, you can keep the heads. I don't I don't really care

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.110
But but why it it well number one

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:15.290
Uh, the work you want to do is not anything in this decade that is useful to build a career

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.700
like

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.820
like

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.980
You're asking me. I mean higher vendors

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.220
Is going to be my answer to that particular thing. Yeah. Yeah, um

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.140
the

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.140
the other one is um

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.380
Where's the roi? I I

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.570
I just don't

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.570
i'm not seeing

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:44.660
Given i'm not seeing any path to sort of a uh, a guaranteed roi

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:51.380
And me as a data scientist now, which is just great because I have access to all sorts of data

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:57.460
That says no matter. It does not matter how much big design and how much up front you do

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:02.040
There is a huge degree of uncertainty

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.300
In almost every scenario that i've talked talked through with folks recently

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.460
that

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:14.570
By the time even if it was a three-month project by the time that rolled out

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:20.180
Still a degree of of so many variables that you can't even know

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.110
That it's going to fubar the whole thing

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:26.070
Oh that reminds me of the topic I wanted to pick for today

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.590
Which was and I have another another tangent on top of that but

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.620
the topic was

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:37.260
shipping like something we're struggling with avoiding the what's alan doing at work is

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:42.380
Helping teams figure out how to take a huge complex prog project

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.830
And ship it incrementally

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.950
Yeah, yeah. Well, and so now i'm at a point where

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.330
uh

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.970
And we were just for ourselves because you and I know how to do that

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:59.370
It just it's right. It's so the one thing is the coaching and teaching of that to get people to get that

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.690
Which is the challenge, of course

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:05.450
In terms of me right now like the people who come and engage with me

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:11.210
I have my team has built up such a positive relationship. I can skip over that

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.410
I'm like look. Yeah, i'm not having that discussion

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:20.250
A I have so much work to do i'm going to prioritize the folks

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.570
that are

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.890
Willing to join this particular party

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.450
Now if it is something that I can clearly see a bunch of opportunity

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:31.770
uh, and

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:37.530
That will that will attract me first and if I can clearly see a bunch of opportunity then they engage me with this

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:42.810
Then I just take over and I say no look here's the thing. That's not what we're going to do

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.560
What we're going to do

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.560
Is we're going to do this incrementally?

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.440
And after we're going to break this down into smaller releases that can be done in in a in a two-week cycle

00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:00.260
And we're going to have a moment after those releases to judge the success and repivot

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.260
I'm not spending three months with you to go through and come up with a perfect design

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.900
I'm telling you

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:12.900
I've tried to do this before and it's a waste of my team's time. Well, one of the things we've talked about in the way

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:20.500
I run our programs in our org is the p50 estimate so that it gets rid of big design up front

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.820
But it also gets rid of

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.340
Running off like a like a scared panda in the wrong direction

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.320
Or the or the ready fire aim

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.080
We could just say no estimates, but let's give a

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.080
Vague estimate based on a probability. It's not vague

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.080
It's an estimate based on a probability and if you're wrong you'll discuss why in the retro and you'll get better

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.680
And most teams get pretty good at this over time, but the p50 estimate keeps people from

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.040
uh trying to over plan in fact

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.360
We have it's a long story for

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.000
Uh a few minutes for the podcast is ending but

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.360
We have a very efficient way of keeping track of when projects are in planning too long

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:06.600
And encouraging people not to over plan but to plan enough where they have 50 confidence in the date

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.680
They choose and that's it and it works out

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.680
very well

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:16.440
Across the org we shipped like 400 we released 400 customer impacting 450 something like that

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.480
Customer impacting projects last year some were late some were early a lot were on time

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:28.200
But we made progress and and that that p50 estimate is a sweet spot for velocity

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:33.270
Yeah, and you know, I was thinking through back in the day

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.070
When I was engaging with pms

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:38.900
Uh

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:44.740
That came from the more waterfall model and they were working with me and they would come to me and say, okay

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.300
So what's your commit date for this?

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.590
I was doing a pure kanban and as you know in a pure kanban

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.790
That's a question that doesn't make sense

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.980
And I tried feebly to say sorry, that's not how we execute

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.700
But in some regards

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.580
And I got feedback on this p50 estimate saying, you know, I don't believe in estimates

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.860
Don't give it just just work and things will work out like I my business says I got to give dates

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:21.160
I work too closely with product managers and marketing people and they have to have an idea an idea and they get p50

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.680
They know there can be changes but an idea when things are going to be complete

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.960
Right because other there there are downstream dependencies of course

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.040
And what they're trying to do is is get those recent because it's a big system and

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:42.200
Your team's system is an important system, but it's actually part of a larger system

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.960
Yeah

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:51.180
Unless you were able to do like I could when I started off unless you're able to own the sort of whole slice end-to-end

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.410
um

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.970
You you need to you need to give a

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.770
a set of dates

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.850
Because you have downstream dependencies

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.810
And it's expensive to have them sitting waiting around being idle

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:13.020
Right. It's it's much makes much more business sense than just simply

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:17.580
Oh, they're making me commit to a date. So I cut corners or any other thing like that

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:24.380
No, that's how it feels but that's not what is happening. Absolutely. Absolutely. So I feel like uh, we

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.940
had a weaving river

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:33.020
Of stream of thought that took us to this point and yet I still feel like we hit a few good points

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:38.940
That may be irrelevant to some of our listeners. So next time I will talk about exploratory test automation

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.260
Maybe awesome looking or whatever questions come in. You can always ask questions

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.180
Um one of the three dot slack calm also a quick plug

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:53.500
If you'd like to spend a half hour with me on a zoom call and have yourself recorded

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.340
I haven't done an abt 343 in a long time. I'd love to have yawn

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:02.220
If you just have a huge topic to share or something to discuss

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:07.820
Uh, we're happy to have some people on the big podcast as well. Let us know for a small fee. Just kidding

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.100
But especially some of the long time listeners be great to have yawn

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.700
As we wind our way towards episode 200

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.460
I may not live that long. All right, everybody. I am

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.770
Alan and Alan's beard and that's the ab testing podcast

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:10.110
Why are you still listening? No, it's over. It's over. Goodbye. Goodbye
