00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
So it depends on which challenge you want.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.960
They're both hard.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.040
They're both fulfilling.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.200
It really depends on which challenge you want, given the context of the team and the product.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.980
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.700
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.940
leadership, agile and anything else that comes to mind.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.700
Now on with the show.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.260
Hey, everyone.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.780
I'm Angry Weasel.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.020
And I'm Colonel Stinky Bottom.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.140
To the Weasel and Bottom podcast.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.580
Weasel and Stinky podcast.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.500
Oh, I should get stinky weasel dot com.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.060
Oh, yeah.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.300
So the reason I bring that up and you can go to angry weasel dot com and see the history

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.500
behind Angry Weasel.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.300
When we're logged into Zencaster, which is working for now,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.320
we have to put in a username and mine is I logged in as Angry Weasel and Brent

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.360
logged in while he cleans his room while I talk as Colonel Stinky Bottom.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.280
So could you, um, the story of Angry Weasel is well known on the internet.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.720
Could you please tell the internet, the story of Colonel Stinky Bottom?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.840
Actually, it came from my roommate in college.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.200
He and I played a game and he actually went by general Stinky Bottom.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.160
And I thought that was the funniest game playing handle.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.200
So college kids do dumb things.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.320
And I can tell you because my daughter is gone, left the state, practically left the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.280
country. She has moved into her dorm.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.960
So far, she hasn't done dumb things, but I'm going to say it's inevitable.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.000
That just started, right?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.240
She starts school on the sixth.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.480
She was able to move in a day early.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.160
So she moved in yesterday, but she's kind of getting unpacked.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.000
And I don't know where she's going to fit all her crap because as I told you, not

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.600
only is she moving out, we're boarding up this house and getting out of it.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.360
So she's like, everything gone.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.960
No, the fact that I'm in a weird audio config today, it's essentially, I'm

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.880
hearing myself, but sometimes I'm like a three to five second delay.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.840
Oh, well, you're going to have to figure that out.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.120
Milliseconds.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.990
Both are annoying.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.430
Yeah.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.870
Brent has like one speaker that's working on one computer and one

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.790
microphone working on the other computer.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.230
It's confusing.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.070
And somehow Zencaster is handling it.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.830
This is our last podcast from from this room.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.210
I am moving on the 11th.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.890
And then after that, I'm on the 14th.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.730
I'm going to leave and go do the Wonderland Trail.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.610
So we'll figure it out.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.170
We'll figure out.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.250
Maybe we'll do one next week.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.530
I don't know what's going on.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.490
It's the A.B.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.570
Testing podcast.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.610
You haven't figured it out.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.610
My AKA angry weasel Allen and he is AKA Colonel Stinky Bottom Brent.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.490
And we're going to do a podcast where we talk about random stuff and hope that we

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.970
make sense to at least one of our three listeners.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.610
So like a plan to you, Brent.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.690
It does.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.290
All right.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.850
I have the first topic.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.850
You do.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.690
I do.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.170
You do.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.210
It's now Brent topic one.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.970
Go.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.690
Okay.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.080
Do you know what this is?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.520
That is a box.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.440
It is a box.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.920
It is an X box.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.600
I don't know which camera it's an X box, man.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.560
It is a box with an X box.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.120
Correct.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.600
In a box and Xbox X.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.240
I have an Xbox X.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.960
Do you?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.800
I do.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.420
I do, too.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.820
Yeah, I got one in a while back.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.740
A little while because because Starfield that came out.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.940
Yesterday.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.140
Oh, it did just for the pre-release.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.460
Right.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.260
For everyone.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.140
Yes.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.180
But if you are an ultimate game, I am, I am, but I have a problem.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:09.860
And you bought the premium upgrade and you have one of these and you were

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.260
a friend of mine.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.740
You can call me last night and tell me how awesome the game is.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.300
All right.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.820
I can't.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.260
I can't.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.180
So we have my daughter left, but we do have two teenagers living in our house

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.540
right now, long story, and they're living in the room with the Xbox.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.140
So I have it.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.540
I'm not able to play the Xbox for just a little bit longer.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.660
Move the next box.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.660
I got to pack my freaking house.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.500
I'm going to get to it.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.980
I'm going to get to Starfield about a month after you.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.100
So you can ask me.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.340
So it better live up to one half of the hype.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.460
So that's all I can say.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.300
If it is half as good as being hyped, I'll be happy.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.220
But I'm worried.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.500
I'm actually worried that the amount of hype makes me think it's going to suck

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.260
and nothing would make me sadder.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.660
It's advertised as made by the Alan makers of Alan's two favorite games of all time.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.100
Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.540
I was like, yes, yes.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.340
Give me, give me, give me.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.500
If it sucks, I am going to go off.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.860
There's no way there is.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.820
Did you play Fallout 76?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.300
There's a way I did.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.140
And I did twice.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.580
And I will tell you the first time it does suck it.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.460
But the second time I've completed all of the missions.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.420
I was amused by the game.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.660
But now I'm just sort of wandering around upgrading my house.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.100
Like, all right, cool.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.860
I'm not as much into the crafting part.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.340
So I like to fall out for.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.420
Hey, so should we talk about our mailbag questions or other stuff we got to discuss?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.580
What's going on, man? What's the plan?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.140
Do we have a plan?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.140
Yeah, let's do the agenda.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.540
Let's go. We got two mailbag questions.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.550
Mailbag.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.990
And the question is, it's from Aaron.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.750
Aaron Flynn, thank you for being one of the three in our Slack group.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.590
And if you would like to be one of the three, you can go to modern testing.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.220
Org and find the link to join our Slack group.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.940
And if the link doesn't work, you can send me an email.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.580
The address is on there and you can get me to fix it, which I just did this week.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.820
All right. But Aaron asks, I'm interested in the circumstances or reasons people

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.500
made a transition from I see to non I see roles.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.220
I see being individual contributor, a non I see, a K.A. a manager.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.740
What makes you go back and forth?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.820
This is editorial comment.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.460
He didn't write this.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.300
He's better at English than I am.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.300
What are reasons for going back and forth between being a manager and a non manager?

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.300
What made you do it?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.340
When do you encourage people you manage?

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.060
Since I read the question, I'm going to let you I have a I just want to keep on

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.540
talking for like 20 minutes on this, but I think it would be better if we got your

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.300
insights first, Mr. Stinky Bottom.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.060
Do we think that's the question he meant to ask?

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.900
When do you encourage people you manage?

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.260
Well, I'm going to switch it like, well, it is about like I'm going to talk about

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.300
that, like when people should when I encourage people on my team to become

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.100
managers or not.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.300
But I want to tell my stories about going back and forth.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.300
Oh, do you think that's what it was?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.900
Because I'm reading it literally.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.900
When do you encourage the people you're

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.250
a manager like all the time?

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.250
No, no, no.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.450
It's about making the switch.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.450
How do you coach people on when to do it?

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.050
How do you choose when to do it?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.850
And even if that's not the question, this is the question we're going to answer

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.650
because this is the better question.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.450
Okay.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:56.780
I have always been promoted to manager literally every job I've had, even including

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.780
when I started at 16 and Carl's Junior flipping burgers.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:09.380
For me, it's the work ethic that kind of always brings me there.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.580
Managers.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.580
Because I see don't work hard or have a good work ethic.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.860
I'm going to let you finish.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.860
No, but I have some comments.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.460
They do.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:30.860
It's just I've always been in a position where I was in the upper runs as an IC.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.860
Right.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:38.860
It's like I'm here to do the right thing, make customers happy, etc.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.660
Try to bounce stuff on your desk while you're talking because I can't edit

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.060
that out.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.660
I believe you're selling yourself short.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.840
Please continue.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.640
Think you bottom.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:58.640
I was always someone who is striving towards perfection as in terms of how I

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.440
was being judged.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.240
It since has been revealed to me through my counselor.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.840
This is this is one of the aspects of how I grew up.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.670
And that's all the detail.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.070
I'm going to go on the podcast, but not great.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:24.470
So what you're saying is your environment growing up has led you to wanting to be

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.270
and being more comfortable in managerial roles.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.470
We'll do that.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.470
You will do that.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.070
Okay.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:30.870
Summarize.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.070
It's one of my powers.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:38.270
When I look at my strengths, we've talked about strength finders stuff on here.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.270
Right.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:50.870
I'm really good at seeing what makes each individual really special and helping

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:59.270
them to carve the Michelangelo out of their own marble columns.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.270
Cool.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:08.070
Early on, it was just because sometime around 20 years ago, what I was

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.070
about five years into my career, there's a bit of wisdom that I realized as a

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:19.870
manager, no one's ever going to remember the projects we worked on and what we

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:25.070
shipped the tech, although that's not entirely true, unexpectedly.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.870
Perseus, as we've talked about before, is still in use.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:36.260
And surprisingly, that thing we built in 1996.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:42.260
How you how you treat your employees, the employees that love you and the ones that

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.660
hate you, they're going to remember you forever.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:52.150
And I think about that legacy and I'm kind of blending into the second question.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.550
Well, let's not get there because I had a whole bunch of rebuttal and questions

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.950
for you for our first question.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.750
Sure.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.150
Are you ready for me?

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.150
Yes.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:08.750
So I want to go all the way back to one thing you said and be very clear on it.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:09.350
Yes.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.750
And that thing is you mentioned being promoted into management, which I don't

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.750
like that terminology because it's not a promotion.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.750
I'm sure at some companies when you move into management, you absolutely did.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.750
And I will now elevate the volume on you saying that and editing because I can.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:35.750
I have always been promoted to manager, been promoted, been promoted, been promoted.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.150
It is a career change.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.950
It's a different job moved into management.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.550
Yes.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.550
So let me tell you a little bit about what I've done.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:51.550
I have gone my entire career bouncing between an IC and a manager and for a

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.150
reason and for good reasons every time I talk about those.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:59.750
One thing really cool is on our Slack group merit has done the same thing.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.150
She has bounced back and forth between being an IC and being a manager.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.750
Some of its contextual and not everybody can do that.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.950
But let me talk about my reasons and see if they help Aaron at all and

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.550
understanding.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.150
So I started at Microsoft as an IC 95.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.150
Here's how I became a manager at Microsoft for the first time.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:24.390
I was working on Windows and it was a

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.390
I call Windows ME Windows marketing edition because it was really about

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.590
having a ship vehicle for a whole bunch of applications.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:37.190
So it was a small team and they kind of just put something together.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.990
Pretty small team doing an OS.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.180
We did some I don't want to go into all the details what we did, but I was

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.380
working on debugging the nightly stress runs working on the kernel and working

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:56.470
on enhancing and debugging the debug version of Windows and I was

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.470
underwater like one of the only times in my life I've gone to my manager

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.670
said I'm having a hard time getting all this done.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.870
There's lots of context switching cognitive load and he says, hey, I think

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.870
we have a new hire starting next week.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.070
Let's have them work for you.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.270
And I said great.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.270
I have someone to delegate crap to and so I had a direct report.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.560
And he came in.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.960
He's so funny.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.360
I won't call Yawn out by name shit, but he overslept his first day and showed

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:29.960
up around noon.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.760
It was hilarious.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.160
This is what he felt so horrible.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.760
But it was so funny.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.360
I didn't care.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.760
Anyway, Yawn helped me out a lot and they ended up sliding a few more

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.560
people into my org for for consistency, the people who ran stress, etc.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.360
So I had a small org after that piece of crap shipped.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.760
I worked over on Windows CE where they grew a larger team around me

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.560
because I knew a lot how Colonel and drivers work.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.560
They put all the testers Estet's in charge of tool development,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.360
driver development, kernel development, all of my org.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.560
The name of graphics over and before I knew it, I had this team of

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760
about 50 people.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.760
I was very much and here's probably where I made my first mistake.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.960
My learning as a manager.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
I had crappy mentoring as a manager.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.960
I think Microsoft didn't really care as much about managing people

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.260
just having people on teams at the time and I was so hands-off today.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.060
My philosophy is give people a framework they can work in and then

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:28.860
get out of their way.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
I didn't really give my team a framework.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.460
Fortunately, I had a lot of really good performers on the team and

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.160
the team got a lot of crap done.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.860
But then I just didn't like it at the time.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.060
Part of it was I thought the whole I mentioned just mentioned

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.560
a minute ago at a team that was performing really well, but we

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.260
had the whole stack ranking thing going on which I thought was

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.060
dumb and I have to go into these meetings twice a year and go

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.260
here's my lowest performer.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.160
Here's what they're doing.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.460
Tell me I'm going to give them a 2.5.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.460
So yeah, we'll do the hand wave and we'll figure something

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.360
out. Maybe they get to three.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.360
I said bullshit.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.390
So I just didn't like the way Microsoft made you manage people

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.490
about the same time.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.590
Thoma invented this test architect role and my manager said

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.790
well, you should be a test architect.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.290
I said, okay.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.090
I don't know what that is.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.190
And so I jettisoned everyone except for the tool development

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.090
team at first and eventually jettisoned everyone else back

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:22.690
to an IC.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.290
So I turned to that time.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.690
It's sort of the IC that's the right hand person if whoever

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.790
is in charge of stuff and I love that role.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.190
I have someone who works for me in that role now and it's

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:31.590
great.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.990
I love doing that.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.490
I did that.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.490
I went over to the engine XO thing and whatever and did

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.490
that for a link.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:37.990
I left there.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.890
I went over and did that for Xbox.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.990
I worked as a IC reporting to our whatever Chris was director.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.680
He wasn't a VP.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.080
He was a partner director, but I just figured out what needed

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.780
to get done and did it.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.980
I've always enjoyed influencing without authority and helping

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.180
people.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.380
I've never had a problem with that.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.180
I have no problem having an opinion and helping people get

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:07.880
stuff done and I did not like how Microsoft wanted managers

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.480
to behave.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.880
I had studied enough at that point about management.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.380
I got into studying management a lot when I argued with our

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.480
learning and development team over the differences between

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.680
leadership and management.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.580
I said a lot of things you're teaching managers are good

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.580
for people in leadership positions.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.680
So their answer to that was to send me to a bunch of our

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.480
management training.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.780
And so I learned a lot there.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.180
This is where I started reading so many damn books about

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.180
leadership and management.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.780
I stuck with an IC when I joined Chris's team on Xbox.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.780
I was offered a role of running the tools team for Xbox

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.640
and I said that noise because not only did I not really

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.140
want to be a manager at Microsoft, but I had been around

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.540
a long enough to know that folks who worked on internal tools

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.040
got shafted in reviews across the board.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.340
So there's just no way I said, you know what put me in

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:57.940
charge of it.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.540
Don't give me any direct reports.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.640
We're going to run the whole damn thing like a virtual

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.840
team open source and and we did and I wrote more code

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.640
in those two years.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.940
Like my joke always is my two years on Xbox one were the

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.740
best five years of my career and weed and a bunch of

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.140
that stuff still being used as well.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.740
Not like famous like the Perseus test case management

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.240
system after Xbox one shipped.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.240
I worked on that stupid science project for a while

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.240
still as an IC doing whatever I wanted.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.240
I went over to teams as an IC at first and then eventually

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.240
grew a team around me and that's where those things

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.740
were a little better than the Satya effect was coming

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.140
around and it was a little easier to be a manager.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.840
They weren't making us do dumb things.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.040
I found with all my experience influence that authority

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.840
and with like the things we talked about on the podcast

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.140
and studying agile and agile leadership.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.440
I felt pretty good about it.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.940
I enjoyed management.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.140
In fact, I think I remember at the time we're around

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.740
then talking to you and go hey man, should I go

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.840
back into a management role?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.440
And you're so in your hell.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.440
Yeah, you do it.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.040
You may not remember that I do know I do.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.540
I totally remember it and and probably over over lunch

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.440
at that Vietnamese place, but or somewhere.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.640
Anyway, no, no, no, I do remember it because it was also

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.840
the same time we went to I went to Din Tai Fung

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.640
for the first time and like everything about like

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.140
Din Tai Fung friggin fantastic.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.640
Oh, no doubt.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.340
And that was my first time and I remember everything

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:27.840
about that.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.940
I if I knew the Japanese names, I think I could tell

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.440
you what you ate let alone what I ate.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.640
Yeah, Din Tai Fung is Chinese.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.540
Yes, I know.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.740
I realize that I was dumbass again.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.640
Yeah, I remember that and I also remember you were like

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.840
the team you were leaving was not great.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.280
Much of what you were saying kind of resonates like one

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.080
of the things I realized as you were talking about you

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:03.380
switching back before between a manager and an IC is

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.880
kind of what I do between M1 and M2.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.080
I often get pushed into M2 is kind of kind of what I think

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.180
is on track right now in my job.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.680
And what's interesting is I love that I have grown to

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.080
love that M2 role.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.180
Why how to teach me?

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.680
I immediately miss being useful.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.980
I get a lot out of helping leaders become better leaders.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.480
It's really motivating for me in the five levels of leadership

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.280
by Maxwell.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.280
He talks about and I love this the levels in the book.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.080
Some of the book is a little weird but talks about you're

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.980
putting a position of leadership and then people give

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.580
you permission to lead them as a gift to build trust on

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.080
that team.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.780
But eventually your job is to build more leaders in the

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.280
org and I like that.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.280
I do not want to manage the details of what my team is doing.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.680
I very much want to help go back to Legione.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.680
I'm a galvanizer and a discerner.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.080
I'm going to help them figure out what is the right thing

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:12.680
to work on?

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.680
What is the direction?

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.180
Let me put a nice framework around what you need to get

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.080
done and then let you ride your bike and I'll watch

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.780
from the edge of the cul-de-sac and see how you do.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.680
You can ask me for questions, but I really like helping

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.080
people become better leaders.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.280
I'm a very good leader in the business.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.030
It is what I will do for the rest of my career.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.530
I'm managing a much smaller team at NBC that did a

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.630
previous job, but I'm still managing a group of leaders.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:45.130
I have my right hand I see and three other director

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.630
plus level folks and my job is to give them a framework

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.430
where they can be successful and coach them.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.230
I just went through the just very quickly the five

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.030
levels of leadership.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.630
I got to imagine this is something you talked about

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.630
before but I'm looking at it now and I'm like, I don't

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.030
remember ever thinking the thoughts I'm currently

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.530
thinking.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:06.730
Right.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.930
These five levels is fantastic.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.830
I wonder does the book go through and and argue why

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.730
that's the leveling very much so.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.430
Okay, Amazon.com.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.930
Yeah, so let me go ahead and finish my story because

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.530
I kept on bouncing around.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.630
I went to unity as a manager direct and as we discussed

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.130
on here and as I've done many times in my career, I

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.930
worked myself out of a job.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.930
I got to a point where I had moved all of my team into

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.730
either quality coach roles into Dev roles into DevOps

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.030
roles platform engineering whatever you want to call

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.230
them and all of a sudden I was an IC without a team.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.330
So I went over if you recall and worked as an IC on

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.730
our ad system running program management, which was

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.230
a good learning experience for me and I learned a

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:04.030
whole crap ton about delivery in just having an

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.230
opinion there moving forward that I still apply

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.530
when I went back to leadership.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:13.330
So I I am comfortable but I am comfortable being an

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.330
IC who tries to influence hundreds or thousands of

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:22.030
employees as I am leading a team of 50 100 200 500.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.130
I am beyond the point in my career where writing code

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.530
all day is going to be my job or even where writing

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.530
code half the day is going to be my job.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.630
I miss it, but I'm just not as good at it as my

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.130
employees are but I feel like I am I enjoy it and

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.330
I feel like I do a good job influencing and leading

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.530
large numbers of people with a M and IC or a manager.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.230
So will you comment on that?

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.030
I'm gonna go back to the whole like how do I

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.930
make that choice?

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.130
I'm thinking yeah, you're right on for me.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.730
I know I and I'm wondering if that's one of the

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.530
if that's my next thing right now, right?

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.830
Similar to you your career since you and I've

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.630
met you've kind of changed what you do and how

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.030
you're doing it every two to three years if not faster,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.730
right?

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.730
I used to argue through on that but you're exactly

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.030
right.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.530
You did and then I think I don't know.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.630
I feel like I may have pointed out the pattern

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.730
because I remember one time you did try to argue

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.330
with me and I'm like dude, I know I take it back.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.030
I was wrong.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.630
I'm like it's on fucking LinkedIn.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.930
Let's go look right now.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.730
Yeah, I'm thinking I really still get a lot of

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.830
joy. It's not so much of the coding stuff as much

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.730
anymore. I'm spending a lot more time focus on

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.330
teaching my my employees.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.430
It's almost out of self-defense.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.730
I run a team of data scientists and very very

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.630
clearly the trend is that a science is going to

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.330
be a specialization in death.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.430
It's it's absolutely clearly a trend in my mind

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.330
that's ever increasing and so I'm like, okay,

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.130
these guys got a code and I don't think a single

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.530
person other than me on my team really has a good

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.730
sense for example of design patterns or TDD or any

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.830
of these sort of modern development principles.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.730
That's not true.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.230
Actually, I have two people one has a one was

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.630
trained collegiately as a CS right up to Masters,

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.230
but the other one has has industry.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.430
I mean your story makes sense.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.530
Do we use that you have more things to go?

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.930
Oh, I think that was I just saw how I make the

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.630
choices. You know, I don't think I'm going back

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.030
to being an IC and it really if I go back to

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.560
the points where I've made that choice, it's

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.060
taking the opportunities where I thought I could

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.860
learn the most and being a manager isn't for

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.360
everyone. In fact, one of the things I do I did

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.060
this at Unity.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.060
I'm doing it right now in my current job is when

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.360
someone wants to be a lead like someone thinks

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.760
I'm thinking of going into management and in my

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.960
head first off a conversation with them and I'll

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.260
explain to him that's a career change and by

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.460
the way Camille Fornier's book called The

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.060
Manager's Path excellent walkthrough on how

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.260
like she's really thought through this.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.160
I think it's an excellent book.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.020
I'm a big fan of hers, but I have a conversation

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.620
with them first to figure out like this is a

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.920
career change is different.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.020
It's not a promotion.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.920
It's not easier.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.020
It's just different.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.820
It's a different job and if they tell me yeah,

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.720
I want to try it.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.720
I make them a provisional lead which means that

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.620
they I don't move the people over but they act

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.820
like the lead of the team and they and they

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.220
function as the manager.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.320
I treat them as a manager.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.120
They're invited to my leadership meetings and

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.520
I like to do that for about three months and

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.420
what happens in that time is they figure out if

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.520
management's for them and I will tell you 25%

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.720
of the time maybe a little less 20 to 25%

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.720
of the time people have gone through those

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.020
three months and said you know what this was

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.320
fun, but I'd like to go back to being in I see

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.650
and because it is a dip.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.550
It's a career change and I want to give people

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.550
the opportunity to try it in a safe environment.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.750
And if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.050
No, no feelings lost.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.450
They got a chance to do it in a safe environment.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.850
Lesson learned.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.450
How did you bootstrap that that sort of process

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.150
within your team like the first time.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:31.750
Hey, this person is going to be an active manager

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.350
without any reports like how do they learn how

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.950
to manage in that regard?

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.350
Well, I talk about with the team about what

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.250
the provisional lead role is like.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.450
I say I explain this is anything I explained

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.150
to you to the team.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.750
When we have opportunities for someone to move

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.950
into a lead position and someone's interested.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.650
I explained that will put them in this provisional

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.050
role. I explain what it means.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.450
It means they're going to manage the team.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.850
We're not going to we're not going to make the

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.450
HR changes, but we're going to have them manage

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.650
the team for around three months.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.750
I like from two both sides to try before you

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.650
buy it's a very safe way to do that.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.050
I don't know how it is.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.250
I know since the big flattening at Microsoft

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.250
is all these people that were had been leads

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.550
forever. All of a sudden weren't leads and when

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.450
I would open a lead position, I would get 10,000

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.750
internal applicants for that position, but I had

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.650
an opposite challenge on my previous team where

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.050
I don't know enough yet about the current team

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.850
where people did not want to be leads.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.850
They thought that seems hard.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.250
I don't want to do that versus all that seems

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.250
easy. I want to do that, but I want to give

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.850
them the opportunity to do it in a way.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:39.750
That's not scary.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.250
I just talk about it.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.050
I socialize it.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.650
I like that strategy in some regards.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.050
I'm kind of doing this more informally with

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.250
with my team.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.350
I have two IC level principles on my team

00:27:53.650 --> 00:28:00.880
and I really want them to understand business

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.180
leadership in my organization is something

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.380
that I believe for a very long time.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.980
I do know my senior VP agrees with me on this

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.380
principle level.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:19.080
I sees they need to be more owning a small part

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.380
of the whole business like they own the KPI.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:22.980
They got to move.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.280
They own the strategy to get there.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.380
They own that business and it's a real struggle

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.980
for people going from senior to to principle

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.480
right because they what do you mean?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.580
What got me here isn't going to get me there.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.380
Did you have a difficulty making that shift?

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.380
I know I did.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.280
I said at 64 for I think seven years because

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.180
I was just like and then I realized I went and

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.180
actually talked to the right set of people and

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:57.780
they're like there's no such thing as as a level

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:03.380
60 at that point a level 65 test architect.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.880
That was sort of what they were saying.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.980
Now, I know that got to be true, but they're like

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.680
they may have that title, but they're a business owner.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.810
They're not just the next level up test architect type

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.610
book and for non-Microsoft people that's sort of

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.810
that where the principle level begins the principle

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.510
engineer. Yeah, it was really hard at that time.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.410
I think it's important to a lot at that level.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:31.010
It's important to align yourself with a manager

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.210
who understands what should come out of that role.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.210
I think it's important as a principal engineer 65

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.510
plus for Microsoft folks to have an opinion that

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.110
matters that you can sell.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.110
I guess the big difference like at 64 you could

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.610
just crank out really good work all day, but at

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:52.110
65 plus you're expected to be an influencer and

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:56.510
and help drive big things and get them done, which

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.710
I enjoyed so I probably I must have been I don't

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.110
really remember when I got promoted 65.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.910
I know I think I was still in Windows CE.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.510
I was because I think I made it to 66 in Windows

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.110
CE the mid-principal level and eventually got to 67

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.110
when I worked in engineering excellence.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.310
The short answer is and we're not going to get

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.410
to the second mailbag question, but the short

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:25.010
answer is to I see your manager is I would say

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:30.100
understand that it's a career change and be in

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.400
the place where you can both learn the most and

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.000
have the most impact and I honestly be engaged

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.400
the most I wouldn't take a manager position just

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.200
to take a manager position if I didn't want to do

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.300
it. If I didn't care about growing people and

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.800
increasing engagement to me, I think the most

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.400
important thing a manager can do is drive engagement

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.100
for their team, which means building a healthy

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.100
org, which means autonomy mastery and purpose make

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.600
sure people understand that they're what they're

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.400
doing and why it's important have the skills in

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.100
order to do that and the autonomy in the framework

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.100
they can work in and then get their work done as

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.400
a manager. You want to build that culture for your

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.800
team to be successful. This is true for a line

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.300
manager as well as a manager and managers take

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.500
that management role. If you want to not have the

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.600
burden of that and get a bunch of stuff done

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.800
that impacts maybe even a larger part of the orgs,

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.100
I think those high-level ICS can often or I think

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.300
65 plus going back to principal engineers.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.600
They're having influence not only in their

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.900
manager's org, but in their manager's peers

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.700
organization. So it depends on which challenge

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.100
you want. They're both hard. They're both

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.600
fulfilling. It really depends on which challenge

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.500
you want given the context of the team in the

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.900
product completely. I mean, I think the trick

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.200
is take on the one that's more important and

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.400
then train up your people and have them help

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.000
you shoulder the burden on the other. Yes. Work

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.400
yourself out of a job. Yes. We've said that

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.800
mission repeatedly on the cast and I will say

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.100
it is still the right thing. Absolutely. And did

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.700
you see my my sub stack post like two weeks ago?

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.300
What was the title? I don't know some Taylor

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.400
Swift song. I read something recently. I don't

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.600
know if it's the one. Why don't you make the

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.000
it was a real story about us talking to someone

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.500
who were talking to their husband and their

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.200
husband said they couldn't take a vacation

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.700
because their team needed them. Oh, I did read

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.100
that one. And that's a true story that made me

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.000
think so much like that is absolutely wrong. So

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.200
every manager I've ever worked for I've all I've

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.500
taken a bit of their style and made it part of

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.500
my own right. The bad managers like the thing

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.500
I took it from the from their style is like,

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.350
yeah, I am never going to do that. But there

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.150
was one manager that told me early on in my

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.550
career that at Microsoft there is never a good

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:59.850
time to take a vacation. Therefore any time is

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.550
just as good. I think that's true for any job.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.750
Yeah. And we need to learn from Europe. I don't

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.150
care what's going on. I'm gone for four weeks.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.950
I don't know if that's we need to learn. It's

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.850
tough for Merk tough for Americans. No. So one

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.450
of the issues one of the issues that contradicts

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.150
that which is there's still like at Microsoft

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.550
and I don't know how how wide it is. There's

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:30.850
still this sort of emphasis around specialists.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:35.750
Hey Alan, what's your project right. And I'm

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:40.250
like yeah I don't want Alan to own a project

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.550
and I certainly do not want my manager talking

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.350
to him about the project he owns because that

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.650
contradicts the T shape people I'm trying

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.950
to build in this organization. But with that

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:58.550
with that sort of ownership model it has a we've

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.350
talked about this a million times. Right. A

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.850
specialist is on this podcast is known as

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:08.450
what a bottleneck. Right. Right. And you know

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:11.250
what you may not actually your team may not

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.150
actually need you or may actually need you

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.650
if you're a manager I'm going to just straight

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.650
up tell you if your team needs you you're up.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:25.820
Yeah. Now it may be situational like there are

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.820
times where that happens but I sure as hell

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.020
hope that you are as Alan said I think like

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.720
six times on the podcast working yourself out

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.920
of a job one million percent. All right with

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.920
that violent agreement I think there are some

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.620
chunks in there that maybe someone finds

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.920
valuable we'll find out let us know. Yeah let

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.720
us know could join our slack community give us

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.820
high ratings tell people listen to the podcast

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.820
send us we don't need any money. Send us don't

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.420
send us anything save money. All right let's cut

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.820
there. I am angry weasel Alan and I'm I'm just

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.520
right now. Okay that's cool. We'll see you

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.820
next time everyone. Bye.
