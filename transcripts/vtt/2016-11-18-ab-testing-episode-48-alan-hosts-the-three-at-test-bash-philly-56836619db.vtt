WEBVTT

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.900
Hey everybody, I'm Alan and Brent's not here.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.700
No, no, no, but even better, I'm here with three of the three.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.500
Can you guys introduce yourselves?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.100
Hey, my name is Michael Richards.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.180
I am the director of Quality Assurance at a software company that does software for

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.660
the commercial real estate industry.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.140
I'm Vernon Richards, no relation to Michael, and I am an independent tester from the UK.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.300
You guys look like brothers.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.300
And I'm Perzi Ababa.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.220
I am a test manager for a very big healthcare company.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.220
Smith and Smith?

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
Yes, something like that.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:59.520
Perzi also a contributor to our Mail Bash, which we don't have today.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.480
Hey, we are together because we're at Test Bash.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.840
Guys having a good time at Test Bash?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
Oh yeah, very good.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.720
In Philadelphia, my very first time to Philadelphia.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720
How about you?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.680
I came once when I was 15 with my mom.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.240
I haven't been back since.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.040
All right, anybody else been to Philadelphia before?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040
Never.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040
You live here.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.880
I live like 70 miles from here, but this is actually technically where I was born because

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.560
I came here in this country via Philadelphia, I don't know, 20, no, 17 years ago.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
Wow.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
Yeah.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.950
My first time here, I've been to like 40 plus of the states, but I've never been

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.950
to Philadelphia.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.630
Most of my state traveling when I was a younger lad.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.750
If there's not a Microsoft office, I probably haven't been there.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.270
If there's a Microsoft office, a big one with engineering, I've probably been there.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.630
That means I've been to great places like Fargo, tourist destination.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.630
Never been to North Dakota.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.310
I've been to 45 of the 50, and that's not one.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.310
I've never been to Maine.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.270
That's just like a few miles away, right?

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.270
Let's drive right up.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.270
No?

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.270
I've never been to Delaware.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.270
Yeah, it's like 11 hours.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.270
That's really a few miles away.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.950
I've only ever been to New York, so this is my second state now.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.950
You're not from the US?

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.950
No, I'm not.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.270
I thought it was a Southern accent.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.270
No.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.280
I'm not American.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.760
You'll be surprised to hear.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760
Yeah.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.720
Oh, I'm a little jealous right now.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.840
Do I need to leave?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.720
This is day one, the end of day one of Test Bash, a two day single track event full

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.320
of some really cool talks.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.200
I've been five for one, have been impressed.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.880
When I go to the star conferences and Lee Copeland's going to listen to this and be

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.400
mad that there's so many tracks.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.720
The way I get value out of a conference like Star is I bounce around.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.720
Because this one isn't very good or not a great speaker, not well prepared.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.680
From that, from my willingness to bounce around, and Lee actually encourages that.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.960
I actually get good value here.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.200
Conference like this, I was a little worried, single track event, but all the talks are

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200
really good.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.840
At least in my opinion.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.800
I thought we could just go around and talk about our favorite Test Bash event and just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.360
see where that goes.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.320
My favorite was the last talk from Elizabeth, whose last name I forgotten.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320
Zagroba.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320
Zagroba.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.320
Zagroba.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.120
And the reason I liked it is because I'm an introvert.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.040
And let me, and I just got the WTF look from Vernon.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.400
Because she gets what being an introvert is.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.960
People who are extroverts, people who don't actually think about who introverts are,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.800
think of them as these people that just kind of, they're, think of them as recluses.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.600
People that don't like to talk to people.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.440
I can be friendly, I can give talks, I can try and be entertaining.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.120
But it requires great effort from me.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.840
So if I have a day full of meetings, or if I have to teach a workshop or even give a talk

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.520
tomorrow, I will be exhausted afterwards.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.060
So introversion is, it's an internal preference, but what a lot of people don't realize, it's

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.980
really the effort that it requires.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.180
I can act extroverted, but it requires me 10X the effort that it requires a extroverted

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.780
person who's naturally extroverted.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.900
I can do it, I can play that game.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.260
And you have to be successful in a career for this long and deal with people and not just,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.300
and have a lot of opportunities I've had.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.060
I've had to play the part of being a loud person, not just loud.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.340
That is a bad, that's a bad stereotype on extroverts.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.100
Again, extroverts aren't just the loud frat boys.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.580
They're the people who, it requires energy from them to not talk to people.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.060
If you're an extrovert, but I want to talk to them, I want to find out this, this, this,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.060
and this.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.860
And for them, it requires more energy to not do that.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.140
For me, it requires the energy to actually get out there and have conversations.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.040
The last question from Maura really nailed it for me, because I'm, well, I'm pretty sure

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.000
I'm an extrovert with maybe introverted traits every once in a while.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.200
But the thing is, in order to find out if someone is an introvert, I have to bother them

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.320
or I need to interact with them to the point where they're going to have to now use some

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.240
energy to let me know how, and I don't really want to do that.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.130
I kind of just want to be able to just identify somehow their introverts without bothering

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.260
them.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.020
Yeah, so it's a bit of a catch 22.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.220
I'm always surprised when people turn with it, like I gave you the face because I'm like,

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.340
what? I just I just cannot detect who is it until you make it.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.820
I can't do it. Every last one of my friends who told me that introverted, I'm like,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.260
start or be under all belief.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.460
I can't believe it. I'm like, what? You?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.780
Like, yeah, I just need to I just need to just tap out and get the hell out of here

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.820
and just recharge because I'm drained.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.140
I'm dead.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.460
I'm always surprised by that because they always just seem to be always up.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.620
Well, and with and with what Elizabeth said was really important that, you know,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.620
it's it's not it's the preference.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.300
It's exactly for her to do.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.220
And, you know, I it's kind of interesting.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.260
I don't know what I am. I don't know if I'm an extrovert or an introvert.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.460
Under certain circumstances, I'm absolutely an introvert.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.500
I feel the same alone.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.060
Let me go do what I want to do.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.340
And other times I'm very extroverted.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.340
I was a radio DJ for eight years.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.340
I just I learned how to be that way.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.180
And I still kind of carry it to a certain extent.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.420
But if I get into a situation where I have an extreme extrovert,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.020
I'm all I shut down. I'm gone.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.580
I will shut off and that meeting is done.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.700
I'm pretty sure Susan Cain has a TED Talk.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.460
And if you haven't watched it, you should absolutely go and watch it.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.460
It's really, really good.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.700
Very insightful.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.460
Yeah, and I can I can identify with what Michael is saying,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.100
that whether you're an introvert or an extrovert,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.140
it's not like a binary function that gets returned a value that you are this or that.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.620
There's definitely a spectrum by which certain aspects

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.780
or certain parameters where you can be an extrovert.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.420
I mean, I come from

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.680
the Philippines and Southeast Asia and the power distance index, for example,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.360
which is the sense of how you deal with people who you think are your leaders

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.800
or your elders out here in the West.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.340
You're being dealt as if you're a peer.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.940
Right. So you can talk freely.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.180
You can disagree freely.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.260
At the end of the day, there's no harm, no harm, no foul, technically, technically.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.620
But from my culture, it's hard for me to kind of talk over

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.220
someone who I know is either much older than me, who is my boss.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.940
And it took me.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.540
Well, I'm still dealing with it until now.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.060
I've been in this country for 17 years now, and I'm still dealing with that

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.380
on a daily basis.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.220
It gets worse as you see these

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.020
titles that go up and I'm in the same room as them.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.180
I just clamped up.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.340
So one thing that would have been

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.260
a good answer to one of the questions Elizabeth was asked around how can you

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.300
recognize these things is there's a lot of good books and some bad books,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.620
but some writing, at least on this idea of emotional quotient,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.100
which is a lot of people look at that EQ is like making sure

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.330
you're not being a dick.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.410
But there's a lot to it.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.170
It's recognizing how you're coming across and how you're being interpreted

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.570
sort of in real time as you're having a conversation

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.890
and recognizing that people with different whether it's a cultural background

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.570
or introversion, extroversion, the way they're reacting, the way they're

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.730
taking part in that conversation and recognizing in real time how it's both

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.290
influenced by what you're saying and everybody else's participation

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:44.410
is a skill that anyone with any sort of leadership or management would really

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.730
it's it's like one of the hardest things to do, but it's really, really important.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.940
Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.380
All right.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.740
Let's that was my favorite event so far.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.660
We have tomorrow to go.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.660
But but Vernon, what what has been your favorite event so far at Test Bash,

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.420
Philadelphia, 2016?

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:07.540
So it was also Elizabeth's talk, but also the scavenger hunt was pure genius.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.620
That was so, so good.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.620
So you talk a little bit about frame that for the three

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.980
that haven't heard about, oh, wait a minute.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.700
If the three are here.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.420
Who's the hell is going to listen to this podcast?

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.620
You know, it's going to be some other.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.980
I know it's going to be it's the person who's not in this room fondly is Mike Stan.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.340
The testacular one.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.900
Brent, well, Mark might listen.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.340
You're right.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.540
So, yeah, the there's a scavenger.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.020
So how this works was

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.420
one of the organizers, Richard Bradshaw, who's a friendly tester on Twitter,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.460
set us a mission to go and explore Philadelphia.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.860
And we had to go and find interesting things and make notes on them and return

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.260
and give that information to our product owner.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.580
And he said, he didn't say product owner initially.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.300
Did he? Oh, OK.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.300
What he said was, here's here's the scavenger hunt.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.380
Here's the parameters.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.540
As far as the boundaries are concerned.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.620
Here are the points of interest.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.620
Go.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.900
Oh, OK. So it wasn't like a real interrupt.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.420
It wasn't a real like a traditional scavenger hunt.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.780
Because we didn't we were told where to go and not what to look for.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.620
Exactly.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.700
So there were some traps along the way that many of us blundered into.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.900
And we had to come back and answer some questions

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.660
that we didn't know about in advance.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.660
So we had to just go out, explore, like Alan said,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.700
gather some information that we didn't know, whether it was the right information

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.700
to what degree of detail.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.460
And then the questions came out an hour later and we had to

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.380
answer the questions and submit them by with a deadline.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.820
And so it was very interesting how the different teams

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.780
captured all that, tackled that from really good, really, really good.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.300
I think what's really interesting is is after the fact, when everyone came back

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.500
and you saw such a disparity in who really was able to think through

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.580
what this is really trying to teach us.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.740
Yeah. And they went back to Richard and asked him, what's the goal here?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.100
Because so often we go just running out to test or to do whatever it is we do.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.180
And we don't know what the outcome is supposed to be.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.380
We don't know what the final goal is.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.140
We don't have really the definition of done, if you will.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.460
Yeah, it was it was very so it sounds completely random

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.780
and inappropriate for a software test and conference to do that.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.820
But the parallels between like Michael was saying, our work

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.620
and the scavenger hunt were quite quite, you know.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.240
Yeah, I thought it was a great event just from the perspective of

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.020
taking advantage of the venue.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:46.860
Yeah. You couldn't tell from where we're at, like that we're so close

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.620
that we're at the Fringe Arts Theater in Philadelphia.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.340
You can't tell that we are like a quarter mile from Betsy Ross's house.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.620
Yeah. You walk up the hill.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.420
It's like history.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.580
Flaming in your face.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.460
Big time history.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.660
It's absolutely fantastic.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.980
It's brilliant. And I've got a couple of testers on my team.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.420
My entire team is here.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.260
And I've got a couple.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.540
In fact, the majority of my testers aren't even from the United States.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.260
They're there for I've got one from Ukraine.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.940
I've got a number from India.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.940
And for them, this was a great history tour of the United States.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.700
And they absolutely loved going to Independence Hall and seeing,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.700
you know, where the Liberty Bell is, et cetera.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.100
And they didn't realize it was really Liberty Bell.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.380
It's not that big.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.380
But but wait a minute.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.660
I didn't make it to Liberty Bell.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.300
I thought it was like six feet tall.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.500
No, it's the same.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.540
Yeah, I thought it was going to be some gigantic man sized thing.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.140
That was really not as big as you think.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.260
And so I was going home.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.620
But I think I'm going to piggyback on what we're saying.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.540
This is my favorite as well, because of the fact that it took an object lesson.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.020
And Richard did an excellent job.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.860
And he's even now worried that it didn't turn out the way he expected.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.180
I think it nailed it in spades.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.340
He nailed it.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.220
And and the way in which it was done and how he followed up at the end

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.020
with the questions he asked and the end of the.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.500
Yeah, he had to lead occasionally.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.100
But by the same token, it worked out to the point where I don't know

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.180
that anyone's going to go away from this, not having this as an object

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.500
lesson in their in their pocket.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.100
And shout out to Martin Hinnier as well.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.380
For doing a standing job is a terrible product owner.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.340
And does anyone else find it interesting?

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.140
I mean, I guess you're from that country, too.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.140
What's it called? The UK? UK. Yeah.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.140
No, no, no. The country, the country is England.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.980
I think you're correct.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.780
It's sad that probably 20 percent of Americans can figure that out.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.980
OK, where was I?

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.260
Oh, we have the foreigners, the foreigners coming to America.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.020
As of two days ago, it's pronounced America.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.780
Coming to America and giving us and then setting up a scavenger hunt

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.500
of historic American sites. Amazing.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.400
Yeah, I'm going to piggyback on that, too, because that's really where

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.600
like one of the stuff that was pretty interesting.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.040
It was I was in a group where mostly are like the people that are in my team.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.320
So we're a very freshly set up team.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.280
And our boss was even in that the disadvantage that I saw in that, though,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.600
it was interesting that it was disadvantageous because my boss grew up in this area.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080
So he ended up being our tour guide.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.160
So he had so much background history that he started talking about,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.200
you know, what are the other stuff that kind of happened here?

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.720
Like, for example, the Christchurch burial site

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.520
where Benjamin Franklin was buried, there's actually four other

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.520
original signers of the declaration of dependence that were also buried there.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.640
So he had all these like tidbits that he was, you know,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.040
telling us while we were going through.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:42.150
But the problem is we I would completely blame him.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.910
He actually follows our podcast.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.070
But our podcast, our podcast, our sorry.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.190
This is what happens when Brent is not here.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.190
He's been usurped.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.910
Is that when when you're actually in a testing team

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:04.830
and you have someone who is sort of an expert, they kind of lead you towards

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.990
other avenues where he thinks it's important

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.870
instead of giving you the chance to be able to, you know, look around

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.510
and look at those opportunities where you can actually dig for stuff

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.620
that you find interesting.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.060
And I think for me, that was the one thing that kind of

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.430
was front and center.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.870
And then after towards the middle of that

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.070
exercise, we just started ignoring everything that

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.790
the Ministry of Testing were tweeting about.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.790
Because we were just engaged and was just looking around

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.350
and just did not care about the product at all.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.430
It's funny, because the after that, because I was in the same team as Alan,

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.190
but the sub team, because we split up into sub teams

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.510
that I was on, there were two Philadelphians on the team,

00:15:53.030 --> 00:16:00.080
but they hadn't really engaged with the history of the city.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.200
So it was it was it wasn't the same as the experience that you have.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.760
There is a fantastic parallel there, though.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.570
How many times have you been working like you, whether it's a tester,

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.740
developer, using an app that you've used before these for a long time

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.380
and they just get they're just so comfortable sort of working around it

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:27.700
and working within its its glitches and things that new set of eyes come in

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.820
and you go, well, why does it do that? Do what?

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.180
That? Oh, crap. That's a bug.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:33.980
Yeah.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.980
It's the same thing if the native going, and this is this is what is that?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.140
I never looked at that before. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.500
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.940
Hello, Georgia and Mike.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.500
I don't know if you listen to this, but yeah, they they there were some bits

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.260
that they really knew, but there was a lot of it.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.820
Oh, I didn't know that was here. No.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.660
OK, I forgot about that.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.740
And this even the the venue that we're in now

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.310
is has history that Mark was telling me about.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.990
So I was sharing the history of this building with Georgia

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.790
and Mike and they were like, what?

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.310
I didn't even know I didn't even know that was that was the thing.

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.710
So so yeah, that was that was pretty cool.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.160
I think ultimately the the takeaway from from that specific experience

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.040
comes down to looking at things in a different way and making sure

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.010
you know, from taking it back to a testing aspect where our jobs are

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.850
basically to provide quality no matter where it comes from, no matter what avenue.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.290
And if it comes from a tweet, if it comes from which is how ministry of testing

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.290
chose to provide us with some of the details of how the product is supposed to be

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.950
and realizing that we don't always we have to talk to people.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.870
We have to ask the right questions.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.150
We have to talk to the product owners.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.310
We have to provide that information back to our teams

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.400
and to the developers.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.680
And however we go about doing that, that's our job.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.840
And and that's what I think was really cool about it.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.760
Hmm. Cool.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.800
Any other highlights from the day you want to mention?

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.670
I think Nancy Kellins talk.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.470
I wanted to talk about it, but I want to hear your take first.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:15.450
It's it's pretty ironic for me in a sense that she was talking about context

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.170
driven testing, but then she realized that there's some times where we can be

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:24.250
very imperialistic about like we can we can be very imperious about how we

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.770
employ context driven testing.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:32.900
I thought what she did was 100 percent pure unadulterated context driven testing.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.740
Like it was it was like, what is going to what is my problem and what

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.540
what is the best solution right now?

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.900
And that's the thing that I'm going to do.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.220
I I I found it interesting that

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.260
I interpret what she was saying as I ended up not doing context driven

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.660
testing because of the context, right?

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.700
Because of the context.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.260
And I was like, you just did one.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.980
You you couldn't have done any.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.660
It couldn't have been any more context driven.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.180
Right. That that realization really for me was was the big key.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.260
Right. That she had to go through that experiment, realize that it didn't work

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:13.130
and then step back and said, no, this does not work for this particular situation.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.250
Like it did work.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.570
I went into a talk.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.770
I mean, I looked at the title.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.890
I thought, ah, crap.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.930
Somebody else spouting off about CDT.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.730
And my stance is testing.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.850
If you're doing it right, it's context driven by definition.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.690
You have if you're not otherwise, you're preaching to the choir

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.410
because anyone coming to a conference like this, not going, I love writing

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:41.290
test cases and actually, I'm going to go to a conference and learn more about that.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.690
No, it's so I was pleasantly surprised.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.010
I don't I'm I'm a little burned out on the where I'm a context driven tester.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.770
And I think if you're doing as any sort of coach consultant,

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:58.050
and my line is all knowledge work, all good knowledge work is context driven.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.930
So I went in there with like my bit flipped a little bit already.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:07.690
But she gave a fantastic talk that talked about problem solving and organizations.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.370
You call that talk problem solving and organizations to me.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.210
I mean, I get why it was titled that and why it works.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.210
I'm not nothing against it for that.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:21.610
But it was a dang good talk talking about I go in, I recognize the problems.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.570
I don't try and change everything at once.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.460
It's boiled frogs. You change what you can.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.420
Her story about now I got to remember, I remember like what it echoed in my head.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.300
But there was some story about.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.260
Oh, no, it was somebody else.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.780
I'm going to change topics because I'm already this is the way A.B.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.020
testing tangent.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.540
You have a tangent.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.820
I forget who someone was talking about.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.140
Oh, it was the talk before Elizabeth Christina.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.260
She mentioned that this team wanted to do BDD, but the director said,

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.580
no, you cannot do BDD.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.460
She goes, I'm going to do BDD anyway.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.260
I'm going to tell you.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.260
They remind me of my very first day at Microsoft when I was handed

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.860
this list of test cases and printed out Excel spreadsheet

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.920
and managed my manager gave them to me and I said, OK, I got it.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.720
When do you need these automated by?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.920
He goes, oh, no, we don't have time to automate.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.280
I just need you to run these every day.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.320
So that was a Monday.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.950
I had them automated by Thursday.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:33.470
So it kind of like that is a great skill that, again, a knowledge worker

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:38.430
should have to know, OK, I know what you said and I know why you said it,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.020
but it's not right.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.380
So I'm going to do the right thing for you.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.060
Great example. Give them what they need versus what they want.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:44.980
That's what I was going to say.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.500
Understanding what, what, what, what's driving this request

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.860
and then can I can I meet that need?

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.620
Can I scratch that itch?

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.300
That's another part of emotional quotient.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.300
One of the talked about a minute ago, it's realizing when you say something

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.380
that I think is dumber than crap, there's a reason for that.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.380
I think I know you're a smart guy.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.820
There's a reason you said that. Exactly.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.780
And then as much real time as I can figure out where you're coming from.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.380
So I can interpret and ask you the right precision or probing question

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.380
and then actually give you what you need.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.740
Is that a new word?

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.100
What's that? Interpret, interpret.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.700
Is now.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.220
New word.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.420
I don't know. I don't know the sound effect for that.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.220
I really liked Christina's talk.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.100
I'm actually in charge of the change management for the engineering

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.020
and product teams at my company.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.780
And so, you know, I'm a communicator by nature.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.110
And so it's it's we're going through this period now.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.670
Two years ago, we had to move buildings very, very quickly.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.870
We had a very short time frame because a building that we were in,

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.550
the company sold it.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.710
And so we had to move within 30 days to a new location.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.190
It was complete chaos.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.310
But the space that we found is some is a space that everyone loves.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.870
It's open. It's, you know, all the stuff that people love about an old

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.350
building in the middle of downtown.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.990
Anyway, now we're having to move again.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.430
And this one is being done

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.420
for lack of a better term.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.460
Really, really not well.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.540
I'm going to try and frame this well, because

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.460
they've known since August and it's slowly they've not talked to people about it.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.300
They haven't engaged anyone about it.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.660
And suddenly out of the blue, oh, by the way, we're going to move.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.500
This is where we're going to move.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.420
This is when we're going to move.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.530
And the lease still isn't signed today

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.250
and we're supposed to move at the end of December.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.820
So everything you shouldn't do in change management is going on here.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.020
And everything you should do is being left aside.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.140
And so the her talk was really good in terms of framing

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.660
how it is that you really need to approach change management,

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.300
specifically the most important one being time.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.060
You have to give people time to accept what it is.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.900
And the thing that I took is is sometimes when we make changes,

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.220
the best thing not to do, the best thing to do is to not make the change

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.500
if it isn't going to work.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.180
She didn't say that in the talk, but but there was a very much implied

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:14.180
state there that sometimes change for change is not the best course of action.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.140
Right. One of the things that stood out were

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.700
Lynette's slides.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.660
The pictures of the cats were outstanding.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.660
Some of the best collection of cat photos I was.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.980
Yeah, fantastic.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.420
We cannot do justice at all to in a podcast.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.180
No. So go and find that slide deck somewhere and just just revolve.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.020
It's really hard to find the right cats, the right slide

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.260
and the right topic there.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.660
Who knew cats were so expressive?

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.420
That's what that's what I'm going to say.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.500
I just thought they were their cats.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.060
I don't know.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.260
They could be.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:47.980
Could all be her.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.860
They could be performance.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.420
If they're all hers, she's got a lot of cats.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.020
She's got a lot of cats. Yeah.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.380
I should talk to Mark Tomlinson, also one of the three,

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.260
because we have if nothing else, we have made a great advertisement

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.780
for next year's Test Bash.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.980
Totally. So far so good.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.100
So tomorrow's my talk.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.180
So it could be a little shaky as I make a hand motion.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.500
No one can see.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.060
But if it's anything, if the day is anything,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.180
hopefully the talks tomorrow are as good as today's.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.740
And no one will notice if I take it.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.420
No, it'll be good.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.700
Don't worry. You have at least three or four hecklers.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.580
All right. We'll throw things.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.540
That's awesome. That's awesome.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.540
OK, so shall we wrap it up and get some dinner?

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.540
Yes. All right.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.500
This is going to be I'm going to say it right here.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.180
Thank you for listening to episode 48 of A.B.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.860
Testing on the road in Philadelphia.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.900
I'm Alan.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.340
I'm not Brent.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.460
I'm Vernon, but not related to Michael Richards.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.930
And yeah, none of us are Brent.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.730
Brent, we don't miss you.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.250
I'll see you soon, Brent.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.450
And the rest of you can hear from us on episode 49.
