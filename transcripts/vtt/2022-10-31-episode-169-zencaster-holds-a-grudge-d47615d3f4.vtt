00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520
It is vastly better to make 50% of the people 100% happy than 100% of the people 50% happy.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:19.860
That may be the little tag that kicks the podcast off.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.420
Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.540
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.540
agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now, on with the show.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.900
You know, you know, Midnights came out last week. A lot of people are really excited.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.580
So I just want to make sure we acknowledge this historical event in modern artistry.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.180
And I guess that's a new album by Elon Musk.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.980
No, Elon Musk is Elon Musk, his latest album is buying Twitter and firing everybody.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.060
Hey, do you remember the fail whale? You've been using Twitter long enough.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.140
Twitter had this, their error page, their 503 page was a fail whale.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.740
A whale that called it the fail whale. Okay.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.060
Haven't seen it in a long, long time. I bet you it's coming back.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.220
Is that good or bad?

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.340
I think Elon's going to screw up Twitter. That's what I think.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.940
Oh, I think.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.620
And Midnight is the new Tay Tay album. Go check it out on Spotify.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.860
Get your favorite colored vinyl from Tarjay, also known as Target. You know, good stuff.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.300
Don't know whether to rave about Taylor or to complain about Elon, but that would be,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.780
that's the other podcast. You can look that up. It's called, oddly, it's also called the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.060
AB testing podcast. So it's hard to find. Just see if you can find it. I'm sure it exists.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.590
Do you ever do the thing where you have a dream and it's so real or you think about

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.550
something, you think it was real, you can't remember if it was really happened or it was

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.790
a dream. Not for a while.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.350
Maybe this podcast does exist or maybe it was a dream

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.390
or, or maybe I've had too much coffee. Could be coffee. I don't know anything.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.950
Anything. What have you been up to, Brent?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.670
Oh my God. This podcast is going to go.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.870
Hey, I am here to bring the energy and you are here to bring the dumb. Let's go.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.010
Brent, actually, it's very distraught, very distraught.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.410
I am.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.010
There's been a loss in a grave loss in Brent's world.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.610
Apparently just in the last half hour, Brent's keyboard died.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.810
It did. And I plugged it in and saw because I assumed it was a stuck key.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.580
And I plugged it in after I found a replacement keyboard, plugged it in.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.460
And here I want to show you, Alan. Right. It's a Corsair. It's an expensive keyboard.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.860
Looking at a big mechanical keyboard.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.540
Yeah, it's a mechanical keyboard, which is, which is my friend.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.140
Mine too.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.580
And it, it has cool lights that you can program. This keyboard makes me happy.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.340
I started using a DAS keyboard, a wired heavy duty mechanical keyboard at home.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.980
And then during the pandemic, when I was working about the house, I got myself a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.340
three quarter size Keytronix, a USB mechanical keyboard.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.710
And I brought that thing to the office now. I love it. I love it.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.950
It's mechanical, but in that kind of not so much to piss off people around,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.910
just sort of thing. Not that people show up into the office.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.310
We had that discussion last time. Anyway, I am all over the mech keyboards as well.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.430
Mine's a little bit more. Can I get it up there to the camera?

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.990
Mine's a little smaller than yours.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.070
Yeah. What's the brand on that one?

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.430
DAS keyboard. DAS keyboard.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.870
DAS keyboard, like German DAS keyboard.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.150
DAS keyboard. So as all three listeners know, mechanical keyboards are cool.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.070
And we've probably talked about these before. I think it was you maybe. Are you the one who

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.830
started using mechanical keyboards? Because you're pounding the keys so hard, you're hurting your

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.630
wrists. Yeah.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.150
That was you. Okay. That's a common, common thing. So I might have heard that before from

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.710
somebody else. All right. Well, I'm sorry about that, but there are

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.630
younger and more attractive keyboards you can move into if needed.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.420
That one was a very, I could make my keys be rainbowy colors or, or make, I press a key

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.260
and then on the keyboard to make like a little water drip explosion thing.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.860
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My, um, I know I've had something that can do that,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.140
but I tend to not look at my keyboard that much. I just want it to feel good.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.450
Yeah. And, and I plugged it in. And just to be clear, like if it was a stuck key, right? I, I,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:21.050
I managed to finally log into windows. I plugged it. I have a, I have found a $10 crappy

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.850
Microsoft piece of crap. You for crap. Crap land.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.170
I got a couple of those sitting over there. Hey, um, I guess we can do the podcast. I have a

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.770
couple topics. I'm starting a little late because guess what? We're starting a little late. Guess

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.810
what? Not because Brent was late, not entirely, but because then Castor decided to shift the bed

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.290
again and, but we're up, we're good. I'm glad it's working. I think it's, um, then Castor is mad at

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:54.090
me because I yelled at it in our last podcast and it holds a grudge. Zen Castor holds a grudge.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.330
Very well that we could flag that as the podcast title.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:09.560
Like I got to imagine, you know, on the back end, uh, they are, uh, doing transcription and, and

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.520
they probably look for the word Zen Castor to see if they can pull some sentiment analysis.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.280
Right. That's what I would do. Me too. And probably in fact, I don't know if you know this,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.800
I talked to someone, uh, the, you probably do know, you know, about machine learning and everything.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:37.240
I talked to someone who was in a support job at one time and they had ML running on the calls they

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.680
were on as they were on them. And the ML could analyze tone and let you know if the customer

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.920
or the person giving support were getting angry and give you a prompt to either calm down yourself

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.720
or to try and calm down the customer. So that means that they can hear Zen Castor.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.800
They don't even need, you need to take PII, although probably, I probably signed something

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.600
that said they could have anything I say on here. My social security number is nine four foot.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.360
I bet if I'm running Zen Castor, if I'm working on the ML team at Zen Castor, Zen Castor may not

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.870
have an ML team, but if it doesn't, I'm there. I am analyzing, listening for the word Zen Castor.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:25.910
When I find it, I'm gathering context of tone and doing a pure sentiment analysis based on that.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.470
I'm sure there are people who do podcasts. In fact, I listened to one, one of the trivia podcasts I

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:37.530
listened to. They rave about Zen Castor. Zen Castor works so well for us. I like to see the graph.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.480
Million dollar ideas. Sorry. Ten dollar ideas straight from Alan.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.440
Someone show me a histogram.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.720
Yes. Yes. There was a time, once upon a time, it seems, I wonder if we've done more podcasts

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.640
remotely than we have together at this point. Probably not. But no, there was a time I'd walk

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.400
into a conference room at Microsoft and Brent would be in there waiting for me with all the

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.680
equipment and he'd have an agenda written on the whiteboard. Yeah. I just plugged stuff in and

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.840
we'd go. Yeah. And actually, what should I do with all this? Oh, sometime I'm going to

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.160
do a podcast at Microsoft sometime and I'll take it all back with me. I'll take it all back with

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.860
me. Yeah. You could even, I don't know. You have my good microphone. Do I, which one is it?

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:35.610
The SM58. Oh no, it's the beta three, I think. I have a beta 58. Yeah. The beta 58. That's the one.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.470
That's nice. And it works better with your saliva on it. Thank you for that.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:47.190
So these days though, a good five minutes for the podcast, I throw a couple of things into our

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:52.230
Slack. Brent doesn't reply and I say, don't worry about it. We'll wing it. And that's how we do

00:08:52.230 --> 00:09:01.110
our podcast. Yes. Yes. So the time of the podcast is Zencaster holds a grudge and I got two topics

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:09.370
I want to talk about. Brent, heads or tails? Heads or tails? Which one's first? It doesn't matter.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.690
Heads is first. Heads is first. Okay. Right. Clearly. So one of the things that I just

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.230
wanted to get your thoughts on this, I've been thinking about a lot and guess what people,

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.950
somebody at work who listens to my podcast said, I like it when you talk about things that are

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:31.030
happening at work. And guess what? All of my inspiration, I don't have any time for thinking

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.310
about other things when there's things I need to vet, there's things I need to figure out.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:42.150
And it's no secret if you're listening to the podcast for a while, I often very frequently

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.150
almost always use this podcast to help me think through things that are on my head,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.030
whether it's a conference presentation, whether it's a paper or an article I want to write,

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:56.230
or whether it's just stuff I'm trying to figure out and get some more insight on. We had a whole

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.470
conversation a couple of weeks ago when I was working on the thinking about when we kind of

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.510
vetted out the presentation that I gave at Test Flix, you know, how I learned, I just kind of shove

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.670
my head full of stuff and wait for it to fall out in some sort of cohesive manner.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:15.990
That's part of the odd way in which my brain works. So guess what, brand, you know,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:25.350
we're in a recession. It feels like we should have a theme song for Alan fixes unity today,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.960
or something. I don't know something like that. You were in music major come up with something,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.360
you know, we'll we'll compose a tune over on the Taylor Swift Elon Musk podcast. We call it

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.330
Tay Musk, but maybe we'll write a song over there, but it's not, it's not even just Alan

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:49.850
talks about unity because the, the conference presentation that we did, we vetted together

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.530
a month or two ago. That was an thing to do with unity, but sometimes just like

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.490
it's not entirely unity. It's just stuff in my head. I need to get straight.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:10:59.930
Okay.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:05.290
Probably a bunch. We've probably had a bunch of examples of that, but it's just one of the

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.250
things that you're good for, Brent. And one of the things that surprisingly makes

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.820
adequate podcast fodder is for me just to kind of dump what I'm thinking and then get some

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:23.660
feedback from you plus some other alternate ideas. Cause this is what helped gets my brain gears

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:29.370
rolling. It's less about Alan fixes unity more about Alan fixes himself.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.580
Gotcha.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.300
So this is all growth. This is how I grow.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.570
Well, I'm here to feed the garden of my brain.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.850
I'm here to help you grow.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:48.360
I'm here to help you. So, uh, recession, uh, I'm sure it's the same at Microsoft. Didn't

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.880
Microsoft just have some more layoffs? Did I hear that? Uh, yeah.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.840
I mentioned that a few weeks ago. I can't remember. I'm not like picking on you this time.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:02.600
No, no, it was, uh, it was a couple of weeks ago and right there, the first to,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.600
to get hit it's, it's always the sales organization.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.560
Yeah. Yeah. And again, um, people, uh, as a tangent, because it wouldn't be an A B

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.040
testing podcast without one, there'll be some posts that says Microsoft lays off

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:22.200
1000 people. People go, Oh my God, the economy, you know, Microsoft employs like 200,000 people.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.520
It's okay. Yeah, it was, well, it's unfortunate. And nothing, and those people,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.880
I'm sure they've all found jobs by now, but it's, it's small. I remember, uh, I can use names.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:40.600
Michael Bolton once was ranting on Twitter. This was like 20 years ago, 15 years ago,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.800
Microsoft can't hire testers. They have a hundred job openings for testers.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.320
And I said, uh, Michael, we have 9,000 testers. So a hundred across those teams.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:57.670
No big deal. And he said, paraphrased. Oh, paraphrased.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:08.180
Okay. Fair enough. So anyway, you know, we're going to grow slow while we figure out how the

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:14.180
world's going to work. So what do you have to do in order to grow slow or be stagnant? And,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:22.100
and there's more work coming in. Here's, here's the question. You have a team of size X that can

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:31.580
do, you know, X team size work, and there's more work you need to do and no more people to add.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:39.420
What do you do? Uh, you, you, you spread your effort across each work stream evenly.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.360
You say, notice it, right? Exactly.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:14:00.600
Yeah. There's a phrase I, there is something, uh, there's, well, we talked about it very recently,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:08.680
right? That the, we talked about productivity versus efficiency, right? And intrinsically,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:15.720
no one likes being bored. And what I've noticed is that, that, that encourages this, this desire

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:22.840
to keep starting things, keep starting things. Well, we have to start this, we have to start that,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.080
we have to start this. And then there's a forgetting that the more things that you were starting,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:35.640
the harder it is for you to close them. Yep. So I don't know if I've done this speech on the

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.720
podcast, like there's several things that I've done that are sort of notable quotables. Um,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:50.550
but this one, it is, it is vastly better. It is vastly better to make 50% of the people,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:58.710
100% happy than a hundred percent of the people, 50% happy. That, that, that, that may be the little,

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:11.460
the little tag that kicks the podcast off. Yeah. Is that the intro to the Alex fixes unity theme

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:18.180
song? Is my name Alex now? Alex Alex. No, that's my son. I've called him Alan at times too.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:24.580
That's okay. My, my, my dog, my dog's name is Tara. Uh, my daughter's been listening to Taylor Swift

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.900
so much. She started accidentally calling the dog Taylor. It's pretty funny. Taylor might,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.080
it's not a bad name for a dog. If I was a lot of dog, I'd, uh, I'd be calling it random,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:43.320
but I get one called Brent. Would you maybe that's a good, that's a good dog. He's all right.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:51.380
Brett, it is a good dog name, but do you really need the reminder of me every day? 24 seven. You're

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:57.430
not the most famous Brent in the world. You know, uh, no, but I would argue I'm,

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:05.210
I'm the closest one to you. Yeah. It's a rare name. You tell me, uh, uh, uh, another Brent,

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:13.320
Brent Michaels. Okay. So you just took my middle name, which I shared with you last

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.440
episode and then as to it. So you're just making up names now.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.520
Oh, that's Brett Michaels. Actually that's Brett Michaels. Sorry. Oh, right. So the, yeah,

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:28.360
the senior guy, the boy poison. Yeah. Thank you. You've been Brett before. So anyway,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:36.440
prior to station. So here's how I've been, you know, I've been talking to folks. I work with

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:42.220
a lot about it while I think through it. And actually I have group meetings like by my

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.080
leadership group. We're all do the same thing. Sometimes it's just me talking about some ideas,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.440
having some discussion about it in order to help get my brain straight and get them thinking about

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.670
the things that I think are important. Now I wonder is my whole life a podcast. It could be

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:04.150
what if everything's a podcast? Could you disprove that? Jeez. I'm in the,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.620
this is a weird version of inception where it's a podcast. And anyway,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.660
talking about prioritization and let me know if this makes sense. Cause I think there are two,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:20.700
I hate making dichotomies, but there's two different types of prioritization. I'll say it anyway.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:26.250
There's prioritization between projects. Like what's the next thing we need to do?

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:33.050
What of all the initiatives or improvements we can make, what's the next thing we need to do?

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.390
Okay.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.390
Implement shimmery blue menus. I don't know where it is. That's my, that's my canonical

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:43.270
dumb project name. And then, and that's where we partner with product management or

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:48.630
program management as Microsoft often refers to them. Like get that partnership and figure out like

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.750
from the backlog of things of customer problems we can solve.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.750
What's the most important right now? What's the most bang for the buck?

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.510
Cause you want to look at the effort and impact quadrant, but you know what I mean?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.910
Just like, what do we do next? It answers the question, what do we do next? And then,

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.480
cause that requires a partnership and a little bit of a roadmap and thinking about what else it

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.720
enables and dependencies and all those things. But then once you've determined that,

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:21.320
and that part's kind of orderly, then there's the messy part, which as a engineering leader,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:28.600
your team, it's prioritization within that project, looking at prioritization between projects on a

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.400
weekly, usually maybe a little more, maybe a little less basis, figure out what's next.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.360
But then there's prioritization within that project, which may happen multiple times a day.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.600
It's like, I have a thing we need to do. What's the part we need to do first that

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.240
unblocks the rest or helps us get the most learning or helps us figure out

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.520
whatever we need to do to optimize the rest. And that's a constant little turmoil of

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:59.000
shuffling things around to figure out, are we doing the right, are we building this thing in a way that

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.650
gets us learning in the fastest way possible? And maybe those, I don't think they intermix. I think

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:11.940
one is a planning and one, one is prioritization of planning and one is prioritization of execution.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.660
What do you think about that?

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:22.900
No, I think that's absolutely true. I would frame it differently. It's macro versus micro

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:30.680
prioritization. Okay. That's not really framing, it's labeling, right? Brett, Brett, just Brett,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.880
go on, go on Brett Michaels, lead singer of poison.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.000
I am Alan Page and I am number one.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:50.150
I think the same, so in my worldview, I asked the same question in both cases.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:58.020
And it's essentially what's the right order such that I am doing things in ROI order.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:06.810
Right now, the one thing I don't do, like I don't sequence. So obviously, if I'm, if I,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:16.010
if I have a, we call them scenarios or features, right? Whatever you want to call it, it is a

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:23.910
collection of concrete work items. Build this database, build the front end, build the

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:30.950
business logic layer or whatever you want to the shimmery menu module. So you want to, you want to

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:40.710
build it in an ROI order, which is often sequential. Sometimes it isn't. The scenarios though,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:46.070
that is more of a, in my view, it's a more of an investment question. Should we even invest in this?

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:53.190
And if we do, then, then it's a, generally it's independent. It's usually mutually exclusive from

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:59.670
the other scenarios. And so you can decide to cut them in part or you can decide to execute

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.470
them in parallel. You have other options on, on this one.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.390
So, so in your note, just to match up our nomenclature for you scenarios are like what I'm

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:11.110
talking about with projects. It's the bigger thing, the thing we're trying to prioritize and

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:17.830
figure out which one we should do next. Yes. A scenario is closer to like my view of a user.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:26.630
Well, it'd be a high level user story. So the way, so what I'm thinking is prioritizing those

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:31.960
is a fairly rigorous approach. Cause he said you're looking at ROI, you're looking, you're

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.640
doing some analysis to find, figure out which one is next or some extra effort that goes into that.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:43.160
But within the project, my experiences and my experience could be wrong. I certainly don't

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:50.600
know everything, but I think it's a little more chaotic and we can't make deep analysis.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.160
We're making a lot of gut level decisions on what's the next thing to do or expressions,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:02.520
experience based decisions on how we order the bits of this and who should do what even if I'm

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.680
leading that team, those are quicker decisions. There's less ROI, there's less analysis. If we

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.720
stop to analyze every little piece of that, the thing would never get done. We're organizing some,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.000
it's a little more chaotic when compared to the rigor that you would put into planning the

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:25.080
scenarios or the projects. That's all I'm saying. Is rigor and chaotic opposites.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:37.720
I didn't say they were. No, so it is less rigorous, but in my view, it is because it's less risky,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:45.160
because it's already gone through the rigor of the previous analysis. And in this case,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:51.960
what we are trying to do is now, in my view, it's okay, what's the execution? Now, I, of course,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:58.040
add complexity to that, because if it's a scenario, if it's a scenario that when you line up all the

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:05.240
work items in the end, it's something that takes three to six months, then I look at it and say,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:13.160
okay, how do we refactor how we're going to deliver this scenario? Because I want some small,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.680
thin slice of it to ship in a month. Yeah. Or less, a month, a month. What kind

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.840
of planet are you from? Are you truly a disciple of Eric Reese?

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:31.000
I am not a disciple of frigging anybody, but if I interpret your thing differently of,

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:38.540
okay, I would say, yeah, right? Because a lot of the work that I'm doing,

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:45.500
right, in data science, when I start, here's one of the challenges I get all the time.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:51.340
Unlike in a dev role or in a QA role, in the data science role, people now engage me,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:24:00.060
and they often will approach me with, when you look at their point of view of what data science,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:08.300
in terms of their ask, it's undiscernable from magic. Hey, Brit, could you create data science

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:15.930
that will figure out who this bug should be filed against? Like who is the actual person?

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:26.950
And I'm like, well, okay, that was too far of an example because if someone came to me with that

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:31.430
one, I would just outright, it's like, yeah, sorry, that is beyond my team's capability.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.590
I know what you're talking about. I heard just today, someone say to me, oh,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.950
we can use ML to figure that out. And I said, or we could just do it by hand. It's fun.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:52.550
Yeah, it's an interesting world. But the worst one is where if I instinctively go, okay, I think I have

00:24:52.550 --> 00:25:01.670
everything I need, like all the pieces. But to me, data science is actually a lot closer to like

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:09.030
making a recipe when you don't have a cookbook. Like you, if you were to say, oh yeah, I get it.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:20.120
Yeah. If you were to say, okay, I've got applesauce, oat flour and Tabasco. I'm going to make bread.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:30.140
Right. It's your first 10 tries are probably going to suck. Right.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.140
How do we get it? How do we get all the way out here?

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:38.060
I don't know. But one thing I was going to say is I would crutch the old man, get off my lawn voice

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:45.020
is there's stuff. I mean, people call ML today. It isn't really ML. It was just a stupid algorithm

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:51.980
in my day. That's all I want to say. So rewinding the stack, this is making a fishing motion of

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.180
like I'm reeling in my fishing line. Prioritization is super important. And I think

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.260
one of the things I just wanted to think about and put this back on topic before we go on to

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:06.550
the next one is I've been thinking a lot about it. I'd love to hear tips from the listeners on

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:12.470
prioritization. You know, we're doing it in a time I'm thinking about it more in a time of slow growth,

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:21.210
but it also made me think, why aren't we or why haven't I thought more about prioritization in

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:26.890
times of larger growth? It's always an important thing to do. Learning how to say no to people

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.450
and setting expectations on what can and can't be done or things you're going to shut down

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:38.140
should be a regular process. There are large companies, no American Airlines did this.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:43.100
There's an article on this and somebody else big I just read about. Twice a year,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.540
they get their execs together and decide what they're going to stop doing.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.750
They figure out what they're going to de-invest in. It's weird. I just came,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.910
I have this weird thing where I come across these articles while I'm thinking about these

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:04.230
things. Even all the way back to Microsoft, we're very slow to turn things off and just

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:10.550
even if it's going to make people angry. No, there is definitely this phenomenon where

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:18.470
if once it gets past a tipping point, it's hard to kill things because

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:28.230
it becomes a self-fulfilling thing. I see this a lot with central orgs. Hey, a central org,

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:36.950
a central org gets created. Maybe let's make up an example. They're going to create a universal

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:43.510
company-wide data warehouse. They're going to curate all the company's data and then open it up and

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:53.450
everybody solve it. Now, let's say they solve the current company needs. Maybe even the company needs

00:27:53.450 --> 00:28:01.640
for the next year. It really doesn't matter. Now, what you see because it's now a relatively large

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:07.400
team, they've in order to clean this up because they had to have engagements across all the

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:13.400
different divisions in the company. You have a large number of PMs, you dev managers. Now,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.880
at this point in time, there's no new ass coming from the customers,

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:27.770
but they feel motivated. Hey, it's another milestone coming up. We need to go through

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:37.430
planning. Now, their planning becomes self-fulfilling, self-what is it called when you're

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:44.230
just trying to protect yourself? There's a common term for this. It's now

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:52.150
all about making sure that their team doesn't die, even though that they have

00:28:53.350 --> 00:29:02.380
fulfilled the problem. In those cases, it would be darn handy if executives re-looked at it and

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:09.820
said, okay, we have a lot of really strong talent here, adding the square root of zero ROI really

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:16.300
to the business. Can we begin a shift where we move that talent into something where our

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:23.180
current needs are and put it on their plate to figure out, okay, how do we make this go to just

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:28.380
pure maintenance mode? You've actually touched on something else I've been thinking about. There's

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.540
another team I work with that has a little bit of duplication of what one of my teams does.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.790
The other team, maybe it's self-preservation was a work you were looking for?

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.950
Is the word I was looking for. Thank you.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:46.390
There's a little bit of that there. What's lacking there, another thing we've talked about before,

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:52.550
is psychological safety. I want teams to be able to, I mean, this is a tough place to be.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:57.830
It's tough to get there. You need a good level of safety for it and culture for a team to go,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.590
you know what, what we're working on isn't in the best interest of the company and be able to

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.990
say that and then be able to pivot and work on something else. That's important.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.590
Yes, absolutely.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:17.830
That's a good, I know it doesn't exist in Microsoft, but I don't know if it exists anywhere. It's a

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:23.830
really hard thing to do, but I'd love to see it more often. I would love to see, even in times of,

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:31.300
I think they put it this way, in times of slow growth, you can focus on this keeps the business

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:37.700
running, this makes money, everything else, and that everything else, stuff is stuff you can cut.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:46.550
Or will enable money. I'm grossly generalizing here. But even in times of economic growth,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:54.310
I think you would do those two plus, are you familiar with McKinsey's Horizon planning?

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.590
No.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:02.250
So McKinsey has this crash course. H1 is your current business, H Horizon 1. Horizon 2 extends

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:08.410
your current business a little farther out. And then H3 are brand new businesses you want to create.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:17.180
You could say when Microsoft doesn't really do a lot of H3 stuff, but HoloLens, a good example,

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.540
brand new business they want to get into. You could argue as an extension of Xbox,

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:25.420
I'll say it's Horizon 3, it's a brand new business. Microsoft Teams, Horizon 2, they're

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.380
extending what people had in the office suite to give people new functionality. Eventually, now,

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.420
Teams at Microsoft is no longer Horizon 2 product, it's Horizon 1 product. It's part of

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.700
their current business helping them make a lot of money. So what you want to do in those times of

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:46.220
economic growth is you look a little bit more deeply into the invest more in those Horizon 2

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:51.820
and Horizon 3 projects, trying to grow your business. Whereas maybe in times of economic

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:59.830
stability, slowdown, recession, whatever you want to call it, you still have to do a little there.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.830
But I think that's where you may end up making some cuts. Because you got to keep the business

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.030
running, you got to keep the current revenue running, you got to keep the business running.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:15.110
I think no matter what, based on prior things that you said earlier, you brought in Eric Reese,

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:28.490
I think companies are better suited when they operate lean all the time, whether it be good or

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:35.740
bad. Because even if it's in a good time and you're operating lean, then that's going to help

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:44.540
you pivot your resources even further towards growth. I think we talked about this exact thing

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:49.500
before, but yeah, you're on the money. In this particular case, I think it's beneficial that

00:32:50.300 --> 00:33:01.500
every now and again, things like this happen and it forces people to be lean. I guess the only problem

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:12.540
is, it doesn't stick. Once the floodgates begin to open up again, then laziness is going to kick

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:19.130
in again. Yeah, but it's important. What you want to do, just as true at Microsoft and Unity and

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:26.860
every other company in the world, is you want to use times like this to really be ready for when

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.060
times are different or better, to make sure you can run. Whether it's lean or just,

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:38.500
some of the messages I've been handing you in my teams are, look, we are not going to run at 100%

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.780
capacity. I talk about flow a lot, as you can imagine, and freeways full of cars don't move.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:51.700
And being that we're not going to, we're going to say no to stuff so we can stay at that 80%

00:33:51.700 --> 00:34:00.260
and have some slack as a right hand and reverse to it, so that we can, one, sustain and maintain our

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:07.160
mental health while we're being very clear on what we can and cannot deliver on. I think it's

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.680
a pretty critical message for anybody in the world over the next however long until

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.840
things smooth out, until the Republicans win the midterms and fix the economy for the world.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.160
Hey, spoiler, that's not going to happen.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.670
By the way, sorry, I was trying to think about politics. I realized how much I just,

00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:41.720
angry, anger. Yeah, I think the thing that you and I are very firm on is politicians suck.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:49.960
Yeah, yeah. There, yeah. A million percent. By the way, if you're in the Americas,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.520
in the United States at least, that's not even all the Americas, if you're in the United States,

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.480
please go out and vote. You will not hear another podcast from us before. I don't think

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.240
before we get to voting days, I get that taken care of. No, that's Tuesday.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.960
Is it? I don't do, I don't, calendar math means nothing to me in the time of the pandemic.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:16.600
I can speak in relative terms. So was I, was I correct that we would not have a podcast

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:24.310
before voting time. I wasn't attacking you. Chillax. It's Tuesday.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:33.430
I was validating. Okay, man. We're cool then. Okay. So yeah, please go vote and vote for

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:38.700
people that won't squash human rights and things like that. Just even if they suck.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.020
Vote for, please go out and vote for the least sucky candidate on there. Because believe me,

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:50.300
they all suck. All right. That's my, I'm probably not the right person that vote.org wants to

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.540
have lead their, their advertising campaign, but that's my advertisement.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:06.090
So much I could respond to at this point. Yeah. So here's what I want to do in a shorter

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.330
podcast this time, which we're going to thank God we can get onto the podcasts we like,

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:17.130
but I want to set up the next podcast. Oh, at three 55, you don't want to actually start

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:24.810
this one. You want to start the next one already. Let's go for it. Here we go. Ready? Ready? Hold

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:33.290
on everybody. Here's the AB testing podcast compressed version. Not knocking out. Hi everybody.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:42.170
I'm Brent and we're done. And there you go. So, uh, this is a great one to get some feedback on

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:46.250
even before we talk about next time. Actually, I'm going to pull up the question. This podcast

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:51.850
is the one you want feedback on. I want feedback on this topic. I'm going to bring up. It's around

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:57.300
everything we talk about on here, but a slightly different variation. We will take some feedback

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:02.580
from listeners and we're going to talk about this more next time. And if you want to join

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:07.620
our community, you can go to modern testing.org and you can click on the link to join our Slack

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:13.300
community. And just to warn you, sometimes you click on the link and it says, this link is expired.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.180
Please contact us. Bullshit. Just wait five minutes and try again and blame Slack.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:23.850
Cause it, it, it still works. People about once every two months, someone says, Hey,

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:27.690
the link's not working. And I go check it. And it's working. I said, that works on my machine.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:33.530
And so anyways, so go to modern to center or click on the link, wait five minutes, click on it again,

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.690
refresh, whatever. I don't know what happens, but the link's still good. I join our group,

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:42.810
being conversations. We have a good community of people answering questions, discussing stuff.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:48.970
It's awesome. We have talked a lot in the past around coaching teams and helping teams get, you

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:54.970
know, accelerating developers and learning stuff about modern testing principles. And, and we talked

00:37:54.970 --> 00:38:00.010
about them from the perspective of a tester helping teams out, but what if your team doesn't

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:06.810
have any testers? So what do you do? Here's a scenario. You have a development team who

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:12.490
don't have great quality in their product. It's okay. Not great. It's, it's fair quality.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:19.900
I'll call it fair quality, plenty of room for improvement. They want not being told they want

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:26.310
to own testing. They want to own quality. They want to get better, but they don't know how,

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:33.700
and they don't have a coach. Let me add another twist and unconscious incompetence. They don't

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:40.330
know what they don't know. They don't realize they don't know how to improve their quality

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:45.110
as much as they could. Okay. Sure. They can write some tests. It's like the old line I used

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:49.270
to give my old manager. Yes. Your developers do all the testing. They know how to do.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.100
And my job was to give them a little bit more because they, they thought they did it all. They

00:38:53.100 --> 00:39:00.980
missed stuff. So you have a dev team quality has room for improvement. They want quality to be better.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:07.780
They're invested in it, but they don't know how to do that. And they don't know. They don't

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:17.340
know how to do that. Okay. Well, they're in, what do you do? There lies. The solution is you have to

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:22.620
create a process by which what they don't know, they don't know will be discovered.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.980
That is the fifth order of ignorance. I thought it was the fourth order.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:32.540
Just if you count from zero. Now, even if you count from zero, then it would be.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.580
So I know something. I know I don't know something. I don't know. I don't know something.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:42.540
And then there is like, what am I missing? I know something. I know. I don't know something.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:49.260
I don't know. I don't know something. You're right. The fourth one is I don't have a suitable means to

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:54.380
discover what I don't know. I don't know. And the fifth is I understand the rules of ignorance.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.140
Do you're correct? You're correct. Fourth from one.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.780
Right. And I dumb.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.580
That last one's stupid. That one to me feels like just self advertisement.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.100
But no, but it means you understand how knowledge acquisition works.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.980
No, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.660
Because until you get that, that's how knowledge acquisition works.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.900
If you're a learner, if you have a now I can pin people down. If you have a growth mindset,

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.300
you'll know about the fifth order of ignorance. I don't know that that's true.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:29.480
I know about the both of them. And I'm the only one talking about the orders of ignorance.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:35.160
Yeah. By the way, I haven't posted my five for Friday yet, but I actually found an article

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.240
published because orders of ignorance is like two decades old. I found a recent article that I

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:47.160
liked that reference the five orders of ignorance. Awesome. It's lots of love there. Lots of love.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:54.200
Okay, man. Well, that is our 43 and a half minutes now, probably around 40 minutes by the time I get

00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:00.440
done editing. We'll see what happens. But this has been a this has been the AB. Oh, if I forgot

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.440
again, sorry, brain fart, AB testing or is this the team us podcast?

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.640
Oh, sorry. A B testing podcast. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we'll see you later.
