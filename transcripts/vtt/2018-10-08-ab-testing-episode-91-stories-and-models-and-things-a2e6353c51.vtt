WEBVTT

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.980
in the testing podcast with your hosts Alan and Brent.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.090
I am mindless agile robot I must iterate.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.690
This is the place to discuss software development,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.730
software quality and testing, agile, leadership,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.290
organizational change, and of course modern testing.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.170
You can read more about modern testing

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.210
on moderntesting.org and join our Slack group

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.050
in the link on the same page.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.450
Now on with the show.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.270
Hey Brent.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.190
Hey Alan.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.550
We are back for another episode.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.390
We are.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.550
There's no number, oh 91.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.510
91.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.240
Hey what do you think of that new intro that just played?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.200
Yeah that was great.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.440
That's time travel because Brent's heard it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.000
but he hasn't heard it in context.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.480
But you've all heard it now.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.520
Let us know what you think.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.200
Or not, whatever.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.220
Yeah is it too much reverb?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.200
Probably a little bit too much reverb on my voice.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.920
We can tweak that later.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.880
We can take a listener.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.640
We'll let the three decide what they think

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.840
of the new intro.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.480
The nice thing about having three listeners.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.320
Yeah.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.880
It's either unanimous or majority rules.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.720
Sure.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120
On any voting decision.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.700
This is great insights from a math professional.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.200
Holy crap.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.810
What have you been up to?

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.810
So we have a big hackathon that's in place for support.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.850
As I think I mentioned in the last podcast.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.530
That's kind of, that's one of the places

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.570
where my team is focusing on data science.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.050
We're doing all kinds of cool things

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.410
with natural language processing.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.370
NLP.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.770
NLP.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.030
And I did a presentation last Wednesday

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.850
to a bunch of folks.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.310
And very first question I asked is,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.470
okay, anyone here ever worked

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.920
with a data scientist before?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.860
And there was about four people that raised their hand.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.540
And I looked at the four people

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.980
and became very clear that I was the data scientist

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.230
that they had worked with before.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.020
And so I changed it to, and that data scientist wasn't me.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.360
And they dropped their hands and I said, okay, great.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.180
The positive thing about this is none of you will know

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.260
when I'm lying, which got a brief little chuckle.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.540
And then I clarified, I'm like, okay, no.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.220
There's some data science slides in here.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.360
Just making sure that I have to communicate these concepts

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.320
without using those terms.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.800
That's why I asked the question.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.060
But it was interesting.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.620
So I did a data science presentation

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.880
to a bunch of people who didn't have data science,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.700
got a lot of people coming and talking to me after it,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.430
which we've talked about, imposter syndrome.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.230
This is the sound of me nodding my head.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.190
Yeah, that was, I went home that day on a high.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.710
I'm just like, so I didn't actually lie to anybody.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.310
I got my concepts across and I got a lot of people engaged

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.190
after the conversation, after the presentation.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.680
So for me, that was just a massive presentation win.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.830
Cool.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.600
For someone, oh, and the other thing too

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.300
is all sorts of people came up to me afterwards

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.060
and they were like, oh my God,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.420
that is one of the best presence.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.000
I've seen, the majority of PMs can't do presentations

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.920
that good and I'm like, yeah,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.560
I don't know what to do with this feedback.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.280
My presentation self-esteem is still too low for me

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.240
to be able to accept it, but I appreciate it.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.040
What I found as we segue this conversation

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.080
to talk about me is that people really appreciate

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.640
practical, pragmatic advice.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.800
So I'm guessing your presentation had some of that.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.720
It did.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.400
See, I turned that from me back to you.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.360
I was gonna go to me, but I bounced back.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.200
I'm gonna make it shift back to you very quickly.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.040
Ah, damn it.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.080
But I do actually, here's a lesson I learned

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.680
a long time ago.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.760
I'll just ask you a question.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.030
What is the number one goal of a presentation?

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.230
It's entertainment.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.770
That is 100% correct.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.130
You are constrained by the content,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.670
but the presenter, your job is to make that content

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.490
as entertaining as possible.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.570
That is the point of a presentation versus a document.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.800
Damn.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.680
Now I'm having like...

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.520
Acid reflux?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.120
Oh, something's going on inside because I'm thinking

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.000
of the opposite of the presentations

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.720
where people just read a bunch of slides to you

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.500
because they've turned their presentation into a document

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.200
that they read to you.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.960
Yeah, I attended a class years ago.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.500
He calls those brick slides.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.620
And one of the things in his presentation

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.720
is what he calls the squint test.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.740
So when you look at a slide and you squint at it,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.010
you should still be able to sort of

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.870
have a glimpse at the message.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.900
So he's a big fan of...

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.140
I forget what they call them, but the shapes.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.540
So if you're about to message sort of a journey,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.940
there should be something that has

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.280
like little blocks and arrows.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.160
Yeah.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Whereas bullet point slides with massive amount of text,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.000
they look like bricks when you do the squint test.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.150
All right, anyway, what's up with you, Alan?

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.190
Well, I was gonna segue that back to me.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.990
I was at Star West, got back on Tuesday night.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.590
I was just down there to do a workshop.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.070
I went down early, went to Disneyland, that was fun.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.750
Hung out, worked all day for my hotel room Monday.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.430
Gave my presentation on web tools,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.090
which is just me leading people

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.310
through a bunch of my favorite Chrome extensions,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.270
showing them how to use Wireshark and DevTools

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.250
and Chrome and Firefox and a little bit of security testing.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.430
So it's a flash through a bunch of stuff,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.410
but I massively screwed up.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.710
I looked at the little piece of paper on my table wrong

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.110
and let them out for their coffee break

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.870
as the coffee was being put away.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.150
They weren't nearly as mad at me as they should have been.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.570
And then afterwards, a similar thing,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.830
I had a bunch of people come up to me

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.540
and say this is the best tutorial I've been to ever.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.790
Honestly, it was fine.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.290
I think a lot of times in testing,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.310
people forget that there are many, many new things to learn.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.870
So the goal, in addition to my entertaining stories,

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.470
ranting on UI animation, for example,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.310
and the idea that technical testing means UI animation

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.350
through a couple of directions.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.950
I ranted on that for a while.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.430
Wait, wait, for our listeners.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.270
For our listeners.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.630
So the segue I gave people go,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.790
testers need to be more technical.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.590
And by technical, they mean they need to write automation.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.630
And by automation, they mean they need to write UI automation,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.850
which I think is stupid.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.470
So we talk about a bunch of tools they can use

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.790
to make their lives easier, a little bit of scripting,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.790
but just a lot of different stuff.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.690
So pragmatic, practical things.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.450
The goal is, I tell them at the beginning,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.310
the goal is that everybody can go back

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.270
and find three or four or five things

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.750
they can use back at the job on Monday,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.110
and they usually feel like they can do that.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.070
The other thing I did is I'm giving this workshop

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.470
one last time, next week, at PNSQC.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.950
This exact workshop?

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.150
Well, I'm gonna tweak it a little bit

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.990
based on what I learned,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.640
but pretty much the same workshop.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.100
But also one thing I did at Star,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.460
and I'll leave it in there for PNSQC,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.980
because I will never give this workshop again.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.140
I just slapped a Creative Commons license audit

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.300
and said, if you ever wanna teach this to yourself,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.660
if you wanna, in fact, I told them,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.220
if you wanna just do this at Star next year,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.340
I'll help you get to submission in,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.580
because I'm done doing this workshop.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.660
No, just you beginning the explanation.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.500
So I've now worked with you.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.180
It is a 101 level course.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.700
I've now worked with you for long enough

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.220
where I can pick up your body language,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.390
and you're like, doing this workshop is an obligation.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.930
It is absolutely not something you're excited about.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.570
I don't like doing the same thing more than once.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.210
And I don't like workshops in general,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.850
because I kinda like to adapt.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.430
Even my presentation style is adaptive.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.850
I would rather change things based on the context

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.510
of what people wanna do.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.310
A couple years ago, I gave another set

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.850
of presentations at Star, Alan on testing.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.310
Those were fun, because just be doing whatever.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.750
Of course, they wanted me to prepare slides.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.470
So I think I did Star East first and then Star West.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.750
It might've been the other way.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.470
But I prepared slides, and then what I did

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.550
for that entire workshop was I went,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.550
I just took sickies.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.110
What do you guys wanna know about?

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.190
What do you want my opinions about?

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.270
What do you wanna learn about?

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.470
And we put them on the board,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.350
and we con-bond them, we prioritized,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.110
and con-bond them out and went through them.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.950
And then it was fun.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.310
A couple people though gave feedback and said,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.320
the presentation didn't match the slides.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.320
And I thought, W, T, capital, exclamation point F.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.120
So what I did, this was interesting how well

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.860
this worked out and how similar people and challenges are.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.780
I redid my slides based on what I presented at Star East

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.290
in the pure ad hoc manner.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.370
Did the exact same exercise at Star West

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.490
where I asked people what they wanted to hear about.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.220
We voted on what they wanted to talk about.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.620
And the slides, not perfectly,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.840
but pretty well matched up anyway.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.640
So that was fun.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.320
So I like doing presentations like that

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.160
where I can just-

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.200
A la carte.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.520
A la carte, much like a podcast.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.680
Yeah, the one thing I was actually thinking

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.400
as you were talking, another thing that you and I,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.200
I think are, and I think we've even talked about it

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.280
on the cast, there's so many different ways

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.280
to separate people into one of two things.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.830
In this one, so often you hear people talking

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.590
about starters versus closers.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.430
And-

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.130
I wouldn't say often, but yeah, I've heard it.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.970
Go on.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:53.810
All the time.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.650
All the time.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.470
It's like daily.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.310
Yeah, I heard it on the radio today.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.150
Oh, nevermind.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.970
I've listened to the radio in years.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.370
Anyway, go on.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.850
And I think you and I are mostly starters.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.770
We both recognize we're not exclusively,

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.570
we're specializing generalists

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.610
or generalizing specialists, one of those things.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.160
And starters just are allergic to repetition.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.370
Yes, oh my God.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.890
And one of the things though I've learned

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:27.640
that's fantastic is when you make an investment,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.000
when you've captured 80% of the profit,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.080
it's essentially, and here, I mean in a generic sense,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.720
but it applies to real investments.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.660
But like what you said with a creative license,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.940
you've gotten out the value you care to get out of it.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.980
But there's still plenty of value in that content

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.620
for someone else who wants it.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.290
Always, when you do a handoff, don't get greedy.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.970
Always give something for the next owner to...

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.970
Yeah, and to be clear, I want to...

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.810
Get rewarded by it.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.290
We have a lot to talk about today, believe it or not.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.440
I don't know if anybody there will take me up on it,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.440
but Star did ask me if I would present this,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.260
again, at Star East, and I said, no, I would rather not.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.760
But if any of the three want to,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.440
I'm happy to give you the slide deck,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.000
give you the link, walk you through what I do,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and I'll help you with the submission, whatever.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.430
I'll even, if it's...

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.110
I'll probably just endorse you, if you don't mind, at Star.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.830
So if anybody wants to do it, just let me know.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.830
Ping us on the Slack channel.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.110
Which you can get to if you go to ModernTesting.org

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.750
or Angewheasel.com, WAC AB Testing.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.710
You can find a link to join our Slack team

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.270
and hang out with the other two people.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.130
All that said, shall we get on with the show?

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.570
Hey, we just finished topic number one, didn't we?

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.010
We sure did.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.450
And we're gonna do something a little bit weird.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.210
We're going to do our mailbag session

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.330
early in the show today to make sure we get to it, I guess.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.170
Sure.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.300
All right.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.140
Mailbag.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.220
Do you want to read it?

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.040
Do you want me to read it?

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.880
I got it up.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.380
Is it too many big words?

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.220
No.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.060
All right.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.180
I think I can cover this.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.020
I will let you try it.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.860
All right.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.700
Go ahead.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.670
This is a question from Nicholas Shaw.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.590
And he asked, you've both been in the technical field

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.670
for a number of years and seen a number of transitions,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.110
both industry-wide and personally,

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.310
or in personally, sorry, looks like a comma.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.470
I wonder how you stay invigorated by the field

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.130
and ensure you enjoy coming to work most days.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.920
I'd especially be curious if reinvention

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.700
is the key to this.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:48.080
For example, Brent's recent foray into data science.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.960
I'll let you answer this first.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.800
Okay.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.640
All right.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.000
I don't know if it's reinvention as much as its adaptation.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.800
One of the things I love about what I've done in the field

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.680
or my approach to the field

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.760
and really what's kept me interested,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.360
this actually, we didn't plan on this,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.400
but you know from me that I hate repetition.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.380
I hate inefficiency.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.260
The thing that's kept me invigorated is that I've-

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.620
I also know you hate idle.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.440
Yes.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.280
The thing that's kept me invigorated

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.980
is that I've always been given,

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.100
or at least in the last almost 20 years of my career,

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.640
given a green field to play with

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.950
and knowing that big part of my job

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.670
is to discover what work there needs to get done

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.230
and then go work on that.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.110
And then always knowing that there are new things

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.390
for me to discover.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.470
For example, I've done a crap ton of different things.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.390
At Microsoft, even though I was there for 22 years,

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.390
I probably had 15 different jobs.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.950
Brett used to tease me about changing jobs every 18 months,

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.260
which was, which remained remarkably accurate

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.500
even though I denied it.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.820
But it was always for a new challenge, something new.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.380
The moment I got bored,

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.700
and there were very few times I got bored on a job.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.060
I was very bored working on that science project

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.660
to make Android apps run on Windows Phone.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.780
But for the most part I had exciting-

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:27.620
By the way, I still get feedback from random people going,

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.860
man, I do not understand why Microsoft canned that.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.310
And I'm like-

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.270
Think about it.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.180
I do to some degree, I understand.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.900
And turns out my podcast partner was on the team.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.740
Yeah.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.510
As a tangent, there was no way that could ever ship

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.670
and our PMs were just idiots, just freaking idiots.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.590
They thought, they were adamant.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.150
Yeah, people that have built Android apps

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.670
will just want to be in the window,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.390
well, because Windows Phone is so awesome,

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.270
guess what, they all came from Windows Phone,

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.830
that they will just want to resubmit their Android app

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.310
to the Windows Store with no testing at all.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.910
And it'll be in the Windows Store.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.670
And it's like, think about this, just think about it.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.910
Look at your market.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.510
Oh my God, it was idiotic.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.950
And then we had the Windows Phone developers too.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.970
And while I'm on a tangent rant,

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.150
the number of times, this is Windows Phone, mind you,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.550
I'm in a meeting and there's somebody

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.270
making an idiotic decision, I go, why are we doing that?

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.250
Hey, we did this on Windows Phone and it worked fine.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.910
I just face-palmed the shit out of my head.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.210
Okay, so anyway, the thing that keeps me invigorated is

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.490
there's always something new to learn.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:43.490
I have written features, I've fixed static analysis issues,

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.490
I've implemented, I've done a ton of work

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.170
fixing build systems, I've written test frameworks,

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.610
I've written testing tools, I've written adapters.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.170
One of the coolest projects I did on Xbox One,

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.450
which was a lot of fun, because you're building an OS

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.150
kind of based on Windows or adapted from Windows.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.310
And this was a, gosh, this is a long story,

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.350
but I'll make it short.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.750
Often in Windows, you would write programs

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.640
to elevate the process.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.660
You wanna grab an admin token or an administrative token

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.920
and elevate the process.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.020
I had the opposite.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.720
We had these modern apps that would only run

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.860
in session one as a guest account.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.980
So I had to take a system token running in session zero,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.980
all look up sessions, and de-elevate that token.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.420
Do the opposite so our test could run properly.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.140
Because our test harness ran at the system level

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.740
with full privilege, but we didn't want our tests

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.540
to run there because users don't run there.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.780
So anyway, that was, I know, I knew,

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.220
I've forgotten most of it now, thank goodness,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.380
I knew a ton about the Win32 API,

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.100
just from all the compatibility testing

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.380
and API testing I did on earlier versions of Windows.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.260
But that was a fun, fun challenge.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.740
Had a lot of, eventually it worked,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.820
as far as I know, it's still working for Xbox One.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.040
One of our Xbox One listeners can tell me if I'm wrong,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.220
but that was a fun project to do.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.380
So I like just figuring out what the holes are,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.820
what needs to get done, and it could be anything

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.700
from technical things to project management,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.940
to testing, to development, to solving what I do more of

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.620
in my, probably the last five years,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.140
is solving people problems, which is fun.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.100
So what keeps me invigorated is that if I do my job right,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.780
every day has a new challenge and a new way to learn.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.060
And that's what keeps, and learning every day,

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.120
that's what keeps me invigorated.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.850
I'm gonna generalize it.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.010
So I can't pronounce the guy's name,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.970
we've talked about it before.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.220
I, well, Chevallet-

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.060
Oh, the Flow Guy?

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.080
He's Flow, yeah.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.200
Yeah, okay, yeah.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160
Usually we say Shama-

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.010
He's got like 30 character names with like three vowels in it.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.890
First off, I will share a little brief perspective

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.730
about me, where I come from, but I will also share,

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:07.110
this is not a born in attribute of me.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.350
I have actually taken this and I've mentored folks

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.230
and I know it is teachable.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.330
The old phrase, turn lemons into lemonade,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:23.610
is 100% true in this case.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.910
So every time some big change occurs,

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:33.640
it is absolutely true that humans will respond

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.260
with a great sense of fear.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.660
But those who can push down the fear,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.860
as I mentioned several episodes ago,

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.130
the problem with fear is fear is not real.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:53.250
Fear is the, fear is about what might be, not what is.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.490
But is this such a strong human instinct

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.180
that it's just natural for people to freak out about that.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.660
But for those who don't,

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.580
and realize that every time there's a change,

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.060
there's an opportunity.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.580
I kind of equivalent to what Alan is talking about

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.740
for the part of my career, every time I change teams,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.860
what attracted me the most were the teams

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.100
that I knew nothing about.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.140
Because for me it is fun to say,

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.100
it was fun for me to go and figure out

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.010
how I could make my prior experience benefit

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.050
this new thing that has nothing to do with,

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.810
with anything I've ever done before.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:49.920
And every single time I took on that challenge,

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.680
I won that challenge,

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.440
and I was able to create something new,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.840
which excites me, but also new to that team.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.120
Because most teams are very deeply focused

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.180
in how they've always done things.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.960
So when you get a fresh set of ideas coming in,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.180
it ends up being an accelerant.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.120
That's stuff I love.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.880
The important thing I would say here,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:25.770
in terms of our discussion of modern testing,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.410
is that we have gone through multiple transitions.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:36.410
And Alex, or not Alex, Alex is my son's name, Alan,

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.880
years ago, actually did a great deck on this.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.760
And one of the things that we realized

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.780
is literally every single time we went through

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.640
one of these huge transitions,

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.280
the most common feedback was,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.560
you know I was afraid of it,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.220
but my role is significantly more rewarding

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.060
than it was before.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.900
Every single time.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.700
True, true, true.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:07.750
And I think we went through three, four major transitions.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.910
One of the most common bits of career advice I give

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:19.000
employees, people I mentor, is not constantly,

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.180
but every once in a while, at a frequent pace

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.120
throughout your career, you should be in a place

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.280
where you're scared, you're not sure what you need to do,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.600
and maybe you're worried you might get discovered as a fraud.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.380
Because when you're in that position,

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.000
you're forced to learn, and as you crawl out of that hole

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.320
and begin learning and figuring things out,

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.100
that is invigorating, it's exciting.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.400
You go, oh my, and it's a huge, it's a stair step,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.240
not a linear growth, it's a stair step growth

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.560
in your personal and professional career.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.660
The only caveat to that one is

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.440
you want it to be a healthy fear,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.840
or a healthy motivator.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.240
So dangling the carrot.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.400
I do admit, you could be so scared you're afraid

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.400
to go to work, but uncomfortable is I think just fine.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.600
Well, uncomfortable actually is perfect,

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.460
and that's what the flow guy says.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.300
You want to-

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.490
Chickset me high.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.330
Say that again?

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.570
His last name, Chickset me high.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.510
I have the inability to prove or disprove that,

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.350
so we'll go with that.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.030
His first name is Mihai.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:39.870
That one I can do.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:40.770
Mihai, Chickset me high.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.010
All right, well done.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.750
I'm sure the three will correct me if I'm wrong,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.210
but I'm pretty sure that's it.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.050
What you have to pay attention to is two things.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.560
One of the reasons why we're talking about MT a lot

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.420
is so that, so as most of you are aware,

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.820
Alan and I are, we can't really say when.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.360
I'm still paying attention to a tipping point,

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.520
but to at least me, it does seem

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.100
this is the direction the industry is coming.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.100
What we're doing is we're trying to get the word out

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.520
so that when it hits you, if it does,

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.000
but when it does, it's not a surprise.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.080
You have time.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.180
You have time to train up.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.320
You have time to grow yourself

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.220
so that you're very prepared.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.600
Alan and I were talking about this

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.640
within Microsoft three years beforehand,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.420
and we very much saw how the wind was blowing,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.640
and I had multiple people.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.880
When it actually hit, I had multiple people come in and say,

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.680
damn it, I wish I'd listened to you.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.940
I have no doubt that there are people

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.820
listening to podcasts that might post that

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.630
when that time comes.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:08.790
Our goal, so fear plus surprise

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:14.830
constructs an irrational response that is not productive.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.080
As long as it's sort of a healthy fear, great.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.120
Ideally, fear motivates people.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.800
My preference is that people figure out

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.920
where they wanna go and target that

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.680
instead of what they're trying to avoid.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.360
But this ties into the theory,

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.840
and we can move off the mailbag after this, I think.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.120
The Heffetz book I mentioned all the frickin' time,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.280
leadership on the line, has the quote that I use

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.680
way too often, but it's worth it.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.340
Leadership is disappointing people

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.920
at a level they can absorb.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.950
And there's a diagram or a discussion,

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.190
I can't remember what from the book

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.070
that talks about an organization, not just the person,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.190
but we can talk about it in the organization level.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.930
If an organization or a person, I'll add,

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.270
is complacent, your productivity,

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.390
actually your interest is down,

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.630
therefore your productivity is down.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:16.820
If an organization or a person is too uncomfortable,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.080
they're at that boiling point, they're freaked out,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.020
they're frozen, they're not getting anything done either.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.280
Works true for the person or the organization.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.880
What you wanna do as a leader,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.900
and what you wanna drive yourself to do,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.420
is live at that simmering point

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.120
where you're slightly uncomfortable,

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.960
but you have an idea what you're doing.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.800
That is where productivity happens at an organization,

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.890
and that is where growth happens as an individual.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.570
And then if you add in some sort of program

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:51.760
that boosts employee engagement from a positive angle,

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.970
because happy, uncomfortable employees

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.730
are absolutely the most productive.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.530
Yeah, for sure-sies.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.370
Yep.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.210
I can't believe I just said that.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.070
So thank you, thank you very much for your question.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.150
If you have questions, you can email them

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.730
to alanandangrewiesel.com,

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.250
or join our Slack channel and ask there.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.290
But thank you very much,

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.510
and we appreciate those.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.580
Little bit of a transition here.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.180
You mentioned that we're getting the word out

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.260
about modern testing,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.100
and one thing I wanna call out is

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.620
for those of you not in our Slack group,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.780
for those of you, maybe the fourth listener,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.740
if there ever was one, I can't imagine that happening.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.700
Dear God.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.060
I'm a little freaked out and blown away

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.060
at how many of the three

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.180
are sharing modern testing principles

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.780
with their teams at meetups,

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.220
and how much the MT Army, should we call them that?

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.380
Or maybe- No.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.580
Okay, the MT Clan.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.260
No, the Clan's not right either.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.780
We'll figure out, hey, three.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.300
Okay, the three.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.220
I'm happily surprised-

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:09.130
Wait, I wanna, I do not want to associate MT

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.090
with any sort of thing that is based on

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.090
an irrational belief,

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.810
because I think that's one of the biggest problems.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.450
Yeah, I'm just, you know words come out,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.810
and then I go, ah, not the right word.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.570
So anyway, how much people are sharing

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.010
and giving us the feedback and sharing what they've learned.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.730
We just added this morning, we, meaning Salty Gunner,

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.930
just added a lessons learned channel to our Slack team

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.370
to talk about lessons they've learned

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.490
from rolling out these principles.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.290
I'm just blown away, happily blown away.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.330
People are looking at these and sharing them.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.440
People have posted to the group

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.560
and posted to me privately,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.480
things they're doing, what's working out,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.280
the feedback on their team.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.240
There have been people that have

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.600
shown my Test Bash video to their team,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.520
and had discussions based on that.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.100
Amazing, just, I'm, wow.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.100
So, that said, I was invited to be part of a webinar

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.380
yesterday as part of the Test Masters Academy

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.770
webinar series, and I think the topic was something,

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.370
I forget the exact title,

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.520
but it was talking about modern testing.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.360
Okay.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.600
And modern testing round table.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.890
Big M or little m?

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.970
Well, in the title it was a big m,

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.410
in reality when I joined the call,

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.890
it was a little teeny itsy bitsy m.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.610
Did you notice Lisa's tweet yesterday?

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.220
No.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.420
She talked about modern testing,

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.920
little m, little t, and double quoted.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.760
All right.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.600
I'm like, hmm.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.440
Huh, hmm, huh.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.280
Yeah, exactly, hmm.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.120
So, this was an interesting round table,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.400
or panel discussion, because I thought it may be

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.580
about modern testing, capital M,

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.860
and it was about what people,

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.680
I mean, it was about testing

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.860
and random future testing stuff.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.860
So, I was definitely shaking things up.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.820
We had four of us on the panel.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.720
One person was your very typical test manager.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.340
At the point, I won't go in order here,

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.660
but the point where I mentioned,

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.060
some of my teams no longer use a bug tracking database.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.380
He just about crapped his pants and said,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.580
that just will not fly.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.140
You have to have that, it's necessary.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.940
Another person, test architect, sort of roll,

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.260
I think that might've been her title,

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.460
was all about, this was Microsoft 1999, 2000,

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.820
we need to architect automation frameworks,

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.780
and all the testers need to write automation all the time.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.220
And then one person, even more traditional,

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.540
and oddly, been in testing since 2003,

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:05.300
and was very, and again, nothing,

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.200
how shall I put this?

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.250
Because I'm not ranking on waterfall,

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.850
but that's what modern testing.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.410
That's my job.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.290
Well, put it this way, that's what modern testing was,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.210
and I said modern testing is an antidote

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.650
to the discussions around traditional software testing

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.210
that are popular in the 90s and before,

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.610
where the testing was done at the end of the product cycle.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.570
Yes, where the testing was done

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.610
at the end of the product cycle, quality was tested in,

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:31.890
and we're talking about modern testing

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.010
as a way to combat that.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.970
She had Migo, the moderator had Migo first,

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.810
and then as I'm talking, I'm watching,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.450
the other presenters kind of go,

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.770
and I never saw so much head shaking

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.290
while I was talking in my life,

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.250
throughout the whole webinar.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.170
And very much embraceable,

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.170
I have a product that requires waterfall,

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.770
and waterfall's not a bad thing, and blah, blah, blah,

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:59.170
and it's a great, own it, own it, own it, that's fine.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.690
Both of those statements are false,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.490
I'm going to assert it, and I don't know anything about,

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.490
you do not require waterfall, and it is a bad thing.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.650
I chose my battles,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.490
but I was firm to the principles of modern testing.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.050
Did you meet it in a room, or was it like a,

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.850
No, virtual. Four-way virtual.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.530
Four-way virtual.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.130
And it was fun.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:20.250
And it was good.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.370
I would love to do, I could do one of those

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.410
every single day, I don't like giving that many

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.570
presentations, but someone's put me on a panel

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.530
of people that are from a more traditional background,

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:34.660
and the most closest, the closest to modern from the group,

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.300
there was one of the test managers said they did Agile,

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:44.940
but it was all focused on iteration, iteration, iteration,

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.940
and nothing about actually learning and adaptation.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.340
So, but it was fun.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.180
One of the things, maybe the final question,

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.450
I won't go through them all,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.930
I don't think there's a recording, and I'm glad I did it,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.290
it wasn't what I expected, but I'm glad I did it,

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.130
and I had fun.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.290
Oh my God, it was fun, because after a while,

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.570
after watching all the headshakes and the disagreement,

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:10.010
and it was just kind of fun to just talk about what I see.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.690
And the last question I was asked is,

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.290
what is the, we're all test managers or leaders here,

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.320
what is the feature of the modern testing manager?

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.520
And I go, please, please let me go first,

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.520
please let me go first, please let me go first.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.040
Alan, what do you think?

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.910
I said, my role is to work myself out of a job.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.910
I have, I joined my current company with 45,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.350
whatever people are working for me throughout my organization,

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:43.510
I'm down to about 12, and I say within the next three,

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.310
six months at the most, I will no longer have QA

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.350
reporting to me because I think it's an inefficient way

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.510
to run a modern organization.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:54.200
I added some more stuff in there, it's like.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.200
And the waterfall guy said, oh, he said,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.040
I agree with you, and at a good answer,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.240
he said, I agree with you, we all should be working

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.020
ourselves out of a job, but I don't know if he believes it

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.680
in the way I believe it.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.680
No, so.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.720
And I wanna talk a little bit more about the last question,

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.560
because I was thinking about this since I said that,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.840
so again, another reason I love this

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.320
made me think about why am I doing that,

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.520
and what makes me feel like that's an okay thing to do.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.040
And one thing I've done, and I may have mentioned this

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.080
on here before, and I do have, for a transition,

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.760
I have one other comment from the presentation

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.520
or the roundtable to talk about,

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.950
but I realized that as I coach,

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:41.030
I coach my team on leadership and how to influence

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.750
the developers they work with to embrace quality,

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.660
to write tests, to embrace the quality culture.

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.740
At the same time, I meet, along with them,

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:54.420
in a lot of cases, I meet regularly with most or all

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.820
of the dev lead that I work with regularly.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:01.260
And I realized, in retrospective, that I treat them

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.680
the way a traditional test manager may treat a test lead.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.000
So the dev leads I work with are my virtual test leads.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
When I talk to them, I find out what's going on in the team,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.680
we'll talk about how things are going,

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.200
whether they feel, it's like a one-on-one,

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.720
but then I'll also have questions about quality,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.840
and what's your approach to quality here?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.360
What do you think you can do better?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.040
What are some things you think you can do better?

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.000
I'm treating them like they are a test lead in some ways,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.480
and now that's in my head,

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.320
I'm thinking I want to do more of that.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.600
I want to have fewer QA people report to me,

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.560
and more dev leads that I meet with

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.560
to coach on them leading testing and quality.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.360
So anyway.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.360
You need to teach them the value of them

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.480
asking the same question.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480
Yeah, and they've learned that.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.520
That's how you go viral.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.560
And it's interesting, because I start to see that happen,

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.480
and it wasn't until this reflection

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.920
from this round table yesterday,

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.840
I realized, oh, that is what I'm doing,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.240
and I see why it's working where it's working.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.600
So I want to do more of that.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.840
Anyway, you were going to say something earlier,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.290
I'll cut you off, please jump in.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.130
Glad you did that.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.900
I wonder if you won anyone over.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:27.460
I don't, there was a relative tiny audience,

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.140
so I don't know if I won them over.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.620
To be his credit, the waterfall guy,

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.220
he sent me a note afterwards saying it was great to,

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.190
and it says great to hear your opinions,

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.670
nice meeting you today.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.430
So he was very cordial about it,

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:47.560
even though we were on different sides of what testing is.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.240
Yeah.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.600
Sorry, I gotta add one more thing.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.440
Go ahead.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.560
Another question was,

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.720
what skills should someone getting into testing today learn?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.040
I said a lot of stuff besides testing.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.340
And I was serious, but oh my God, the looks.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.500
Yeah, anyway, go on.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.740
Yeah, I know.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.080
I had to look at that webinar.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.480
Right, you're having too much fun

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.640
rethinking it right now,

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.440
and of course the problem is,

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.240
if you're not careful,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.960
then you can come across as all you're trying to do

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.640
is screw with the other panelists.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.770
Right, and I don't think I...

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.610
And that's not our goal.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.930
That wasn't my goal.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.250
I answered the questions as honestly as I could.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.650
I wasn't screwing with them.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.490
Right.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.310
And I let them have their piece.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:45.930
I didn't argue with them on everything I disagreed with.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.650
We have a different perspective,

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.050
and it's one that I've repeatedly vetted out.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:01.530
You're going in a direction I have never gone,

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.730
but I think you'll succeed in that.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.130
I've never been a director of QA

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.810
trying to get rid of my whole team.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.490
Right, and still make...

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.090
But that's not your ultimate goal.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.690
It's essentially, how do I make this business function better

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.650
and then recognizing the way you need to do that

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.490
will result in your team disappearing.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.890
Exactly, the goal isn't to get rid of the team.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:26.530
The goal is to...

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.990
What's the first principle of modern testing?

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.870
Business first.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.750
My goal is to improve the business.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.890
I'm improving the business

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.150
and sort of making principle number seven happen

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:40.900
because it's the right thing to do for the business.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.740
Absolutely.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.580
I didn't even pre-think that, but holy crap, that's cool.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.580
We're expressing, even with Agile testing out and Agile out,

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:54.700
I still accuse the Agile manifesto of this,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.170
but essentially, with as long as it's been out,

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.170
there's still far too many people that are polarized.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:07.570
There is absolutely no valid place for waterfall.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:12.570
It never should have existed, even in the paper.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.410
It says don't do this.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.290
I used to highlight that, yeah, yeah.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.360
And granted, most people doing waterfall

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.240
are usually doing something closer to spiral model, but still.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.240
But a lot of folks have come up with a definition of success

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.640
based off years of experience, and it's still very true.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.700
When you have years of experience of solving problems

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.440
using a particular toolset,

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.920
you kind of generally tend to look at all problems

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.720
with that toolset.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.140
And then at some point in time,

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.260
you're just basically trying to solve problems,

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.820
and oftentimes you don't actually have the time

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.600
to sit back and say, is there a better way?

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:06.900
And the waterfall approach today, in my view,

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.400
they're sort of taking an evolutionary approach,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.240
and I do think the time is right

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.120
for taking a revolutionary approach

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.160
and rethink the whole system.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.890
And that's what I think modern testing is about.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.570
One other question, and we're not gonna get

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.570
super deep into this, but this is gonna kick off

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.490
a nice discussion for the next podcast.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.330
Yes.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.010
Is another, it wasn't a question.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.690
Oh, I use this line, which I know I've used

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:36.970
on the podcast before, probably when talking about

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.810
the principle around our job

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.610
as nurturing the quality culture.

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.050
I think that's four, I could be wrong.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.610
Josh, why did we number them?

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.770
Yeah, we even had the Ministry of Testing

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.870
even created this fan-

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.270
Wonderful poster.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:56.110
Cheat cheat.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:56.930
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.130
We should just...

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:01.170
Oh, by the way, Ministry of Testing,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.450
three of all heard of them.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:03.810
You know they have the boss boss,

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.570
which are Bradshaw, they also have different bosses,

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.690
different features.

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:11.740
They have an editor boss, Melissa Eden.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.820
Yep, I just hired her for the Unity office.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.420
She's gonna work at Unity Austin

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:16.660
and make awesome things happen.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.320
You couldn't talk about it last time.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.140
I couldn't, but she announced it on Twitter.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.040
Oh my, this is like, I'm building the dream team.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.820
This is good.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.180
So anyway, back on topic.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.460
Oh, the point I made, I said something very close to this.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.500
I'm sure all the other panelists will agree

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.780
that it's not testing's job to own quality.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.930
One of my few head nods.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:47.410
Said, but I do think people on my team are responsible

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.720
and accountable for building the quality culture.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.800
That was my quote.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.000
And then to tie us into a conversation before,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.240
as my team slowly moves into reporting to dev,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.360
they're not going away, I'll still meet with them.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.960
We're just swapping the dotted lines and dashed lines.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.680
I will begin to hold those dev leads,

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.280
my virtual test leads accountable

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.260
for growing that quality culture.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.260
And someone might say,

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.620
how do you hold them accountable if they don't work

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.460
for you?

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.340
And I can hold them accountable.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.620
I know how to do leadership.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.460
Anyway.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.740
The answer is leadership.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.580
Yeah.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:27.460
So one of the panelists, a waterfall panelist,

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.620
I'll call him out by name, said, well,

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.740
you can talk about that,

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.960
but the quality culture is abstract.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.120
And I said, well, if you just call it quality culture is,

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.520
but I think you can define attributes of a quality culture.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.540
And these may be different contextually for every team,

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.560
but I don't know, I think you can define them.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.600
And in fact, and I'm sure I've read these before

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.560
on the podcast,

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.520
but I think we'll maybe do some deeper dives into these.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.680
Beginning next time.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.120
I think I can define them knowing full well

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.280
you have already.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.760
I was in a conversation with my peer managers at,

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.790
well, yeah, some other quality managers at Unity

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.430
and I brought up the same statement.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.110
I do believe I hold my team accountable

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.150
for building the quality culture.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.310
It's been in the principles for a while.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.070
I fully believe that.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.080
And it wasn't so blatant disaster.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:26.920
Well, it's abstract.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.760
What do you mean by that?

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.880
It was like, well, what does that mean?

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.400
How do we, how do we grow that?

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.500
Me looking for some work to do said,

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.950
let me see if I can define that.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.690
I sat and stared at my computer and said, oh crap.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.710
I don't know how to define that.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:44.580
And, but then I thought I, I do at this stage

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.300
in my career, I do so much of my job,

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.460
just in my head, walking around thinking

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.420
and after am I myself, just cause I'm not typing

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.060
into keyboard, if I'm thinking

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.420
and maybe I'm actually working,

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:01.420
but I just reflected and thought for days

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.480
and then some things started forming in my head

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.980
and I wrote up and you've seen a copy.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.920
When I sat down to write up what turned out

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.680
to be a little bit of a capability model

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.760
or a maturity model, if you will,

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.140
it spit out in an hour.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.160
And we've used it a lot at Unity.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.820
We've begun to use it as a way to identify

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.740
how a team is going to grow their quality culture.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.860
And so far it's worked remarkably well.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.420
Made a few edits, a few tweaks,

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.400
but it's being used by a lot of teams

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.860
and working very, very well.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.860
So I think we'll dive into what the full maturity level is,

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.650
but I do wanna walk through

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.470
what the different capabilities are,

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.930
what the different things I think a team

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.790
with a high quality culture should exhibit.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.820
And those are in order, and we'll take a little bit

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.620
of time to comment on each one,

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.400
but we'll dive in deeper later.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.620
The first one is testing breadth.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.900
And this is about, there's a lot of teams that think,

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.160
well, my unit test passed at 100%,

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.740
we must be ready to ship.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.060
Just recognizing that there are different kinds of testing

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.360
the team needs to do, things to think about.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.220
The agile testing quadrants fit really well in here

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:29.960
as a model, but thinking about not just functional testing,

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.000
but thinking upfront, are there security applications here?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.360
Should we do a threat model?

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.740
What sort of reliability or stress testing would we do?

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.880
How is this going to integrate with other components?

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.620
Thinking about those things upfront

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.640
versus just writing a bunch of functional tests.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.840
I think teams with a high, with a team,

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.280
an organization with a high quality culture

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.980
will consider those things strategically

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.220
and comprehensively throughout their product sector.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:46:00.180
I think anything worthwhile classified

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.400
under something called a maturity model,

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.640
regardless if it's abstract or not,

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.860
is gonna evaluate the system at play

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:17.100
and essentially try to advance people

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.140
through the maturity model and the highest ROI.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:25.240
To be clear, I hate maturity models.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.700
I hated, pardon me, hated writing this

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.040
because I knew it would be,

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.300
I guess the problem is maturity models are,

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.660
the problems I've seen is one,

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.860
they're treated as a scorecard, which I frickin' hate.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.280
Then rename yours.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.960
I try to call it a capability model,

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.960
but everybody keeps on calling it maturity models.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.040
I don't call it a model.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:45.880
Maturity guidelines.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.200
I actually know what we call it.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.080
You know what's caught on with my peers?

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.220
We call it the thing, for lack of a better name.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.060
Awesome.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:57.100
So another one is quality and test ownership.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.660
Who owns quality?

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:03.160
A team with a low level of thinginess,

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.220
maturity, capabilities.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.260
A test team would own all the quality on the team.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.260
They test quality in.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.920
Whereas a team that's very mature,

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.580
like principle number seven,

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.540
may not have the need for a quality

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.380
and testing specialist.

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.540
Actually, I don't think that's the lowest.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.260
The lowest is you've hired a test team

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.120
who doesn't actually own it.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.900
They just serve the role of being the ones to blame.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.500
Which is, as you know,

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.140
the way there's still a reasonable amount

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.820
of testing out there like that.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.820
And I heard about it yesterday.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.300
How the team deals with technical debt and maintenance.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.580
Not just bug backlog, but technical debt in general.

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.420
Is it pile up?

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.500
Yeah.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.260
We'll talk about this more.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.780
But for me, that one,

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:51.010
that one right there.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.290
In terms of my own transition,

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.050
the three have heard this story over and over again.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:01.730
I left test, went to dev as in Bing.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:05.710
And that one, if there was one single decision

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.320
that just friggin' solidified me on this,

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.000
is getting rid of the bug database.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.820
Yeah.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.410
That one thing,

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:17.810
you get rid of the bug database,

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.090
yeah, it's gonna freak out Waterfall Guy.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:21.090
Right?

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.410
Because it's essentially, well, how do we keep up?

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.530
No, the only way you can keep up

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.770
is to stay clean all of the time.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.050
Yes.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.130
That is the only way.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:33.810
So, and the thing I talk about with my team is,

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.110
now everybody's fully on board,

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:38.650
on their way to getting the zero bug backlog.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.540
But the thing they're thinking about now,

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.100
in our digital conversations is,

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.380
what other debt do we have?

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.220
What's our other debt?

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.540
And thinking about that,

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.820
because there are other kinds of debt than bugs.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.660
Code quality and tuning.

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.500
Can I tell you?

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.770
There's code quality, oh, you're not gonna go on?

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:57.930
Okay, tell me.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.690
So, the next thing is,

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.240
once you get rid of the technical debt,

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.400
then what you need to do is

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.620
evaluate your ability to scale.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.000
Build a KPI that you trust,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.140
and it's context sensitive,

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.940
I can't give you any firmware guidance in this.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.860
Build a KPI that you trust,

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.160
that indicates whether or not

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.710
your current system can scale

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:28.100
to the predicted load three months from now.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:28.940
Yeah.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.380
Okay, and that's all you care about.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.820
You wanna know, the second it goes under three months,

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.060
you go, okay, we gotta make a change.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.100
We got three months,

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.040
because we can't scale now.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.160
Code quality and tooling,

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.310
and this is mostly about,

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.230
again, these are contextualized

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.110
from the things that I wanna see happen,

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:48.790
but this is, what's happening in CI?

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.400
What's happening in the check-in gates?

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.060
Is it, do we have analysis tools running,

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.340
which again, create debt,

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.260
these things like principles overlap,

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.420
and you'll see that these attributes overlap

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.480
with modern testing principles as well.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.300
The development approach,

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.980
we've all seen bad Kanban and bad Scrum.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.420
Enough said. Fragile.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.260
Enough said.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.100
Yeah.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.580
So, there's a level of maturity there.

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:19.220
I am fascinated at the number of distinct variants

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.140
of the said two.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:21.980
Yeah.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:22.820
Oh yeah.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.700
I forgot to periscope this one, like I said it would.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.940
Maybe another one, but there was a face palm right there.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.940
Learning and improvement,

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:35.060
and this is for a respective time,

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.500
think of a team doing really good retrospectives

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.500
and acting on them,

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.220
and that's being a high level of maturity,

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.180
and teams that just kind of go through the motions

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.780
and don't ever learn.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.100
Build, measure, learn.

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.860
Not build, measure.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.020
Or just build.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.460
Build, build, build, build, build.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.460
That's iteration, right?

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.300
Well, and sometimes the worst would be

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.520
you have three separate teams.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.100
Oh, we build, measure, learn.

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.040
That's the build team, that's the measure team.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.480
There's the learn team.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.500
There's a meta point around the quality culture,

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.660
and which involves leadership support.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.260
And does leadership give a,

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:10.620
there's a weird growth where leadership doesn't care.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.720
It's like, whatever, do what you want.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.680
There's a stage where they care too much,

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.120
and they're driving quality through scorecards

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:22.600
and trying to micromanage a bunch of these things.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.800
Then there's a level where the quality culture

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.520
is part of what the team does,

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.120
and they stay out of the way.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.920
So it's an interesting curve

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.720
of how leadership support is needed.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.360
You need leadership to supply a rallying cry,

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.960
and to emphasize that it's important.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.160
And then, like one of my favorite authors, Steve Denning,

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.720
says, you give the team a framework to work in,

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.960
and then get out of their way.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:49.280
And quality culture is a very good example.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.740
You cannot escape without that framework.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.670
That's actually the fundamental difference

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.190
between the first stage and the last stage.

00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.970
Yeah.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:02.170
All right, so maybe in the next podcast,

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:05.650
we'll talk a little bit more about some or all of those,

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:07.050
little deeper dive.

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.750
I think we should go deeper.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.150
Yeah, for sure, but not today.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.800
We're out of time.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.640
Agreed.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.400
All right, thanks again for listening

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.840
to the AB testing podcast.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:17.960
I am still Alan.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.800
I'm Brent.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.640
All right, bye.
