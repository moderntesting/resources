WEBVTT

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.280
Hey everyone. Hello. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we're back for episode 12 of AB testing.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.520
We're almost getting to the point where I'm going to be or not be able to keep track.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.600
All right, Brent, stop pounding on the table and get your face in the microphone. That's all I ask.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.340
Testing. All right, great. Yeah. Hey, I think we, we get a lot of flack, but I'm getting some flack

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.540
about us talking about our three listeners. Apparently we have more. We don't know how

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
many more, but you know, we have listeners in Australia. Somebody said, Hey, you have listeners

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.540
here. So I think we may have more than we think for, including your God. Okay. The indirect advice

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.100
I got was to stop making references to our, our low listener count. Maybe someone might feel like,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.500
well, if there's only three, maybe I'm too many and maybe there's something wrong. I'm not noticing

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.020
with what the, I've been thinking through like marketing plans for us and to get t-shirts.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.500
I'm one of the three and things like that. I don't know if I approve of that advice.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:22.240
All right. Whatever. Okay. Hey. Caps, mugs, watches. Yeah. Great. Doggy vests.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.240
Sure. Absolutely. We can branch out. So last week talked about interviews and some

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.280
junk going on there and then, kablamo, we get mail this week saying, Hey, we're changing the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.880
way we're moving jobs at Microsoft. We're not going to make it. I'm not going to totally

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.600
leak the mail, which I'm sure is already posted on several news sites, but basically it said that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.760
moving between jobs at Microsoft is a lot easier. You don't have to be in job as long as let's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.080
let people find out, you know, figure out where they can have the biggest impact,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.900
which I think is great. The thing missing from the mail I thought was we still, I mentioned

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.060
this last week, we still at Microsoft, the one flaw we have in our internal interviews left is

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.420
that we still put people through basically the same interview they had to go through to get hired

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.780
at Microsoft. And my assumption is we've hired them once. If we want to bring them to their team,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.740
they've done pretty well. I want to primarily interview them for, I want to know how they're

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.350
going to work with others, how they're going to fit on the team. And to do that, I can talk to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.910
them, but, and I'll get some good information there. So I can, I can get some good behavioral

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.150
ideas, but I really, really want to heavily rely on peer feedback and we don't have a great system

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.180
for peer feedback. There was, so you mentioned there, I'm going to, I'm going to rewind just a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.420
second. Cause you mentioned that there was just one thing that you saw missing and that's actually

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.380
the logistics around the interview process. There was one other thing missing. We'll see if it's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.670
as big as mine, but yeah, another one, um, that I saw missing is it didn't seem to address.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.670
So let's say you, you, it significantly reduced the friction around, uh, finding and getting a new job.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.470
That was fantastic or exploring it. Um, there were other restrictions that used to be in place,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:26.510
that made it, um, really hard short of, of staying in your team for two years. It made

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.950
it really hard for you to transfer out of that. Uh, and as we've talked about in the past,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.550
right? Team fit is really important. Sometimes you don't detect that in, in the interview. And when

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.790
you get in there and four months later you realize, holy crap, I may not actually be the fit for the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.230
culture for this team. You're kind of stuck there for another couple of years until, until you can,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.350
go either fix it in that org or go and find another org that has a fit. But the one thing

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.190
that I didn't see, let's say you go through this new process and you get accepted. I didn't

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.550
see any limitation on how long your existing team can hold on to you before you transferred.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.260
The current process today, you pass an interview, uh, your existing team can only hold on to you

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.050
for a minimum of a month. I didn't see any discussion of that minimum. Cause so now what

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.330
I'm worried about, great. Yes, Alan, you can go to this new team. How's 2017 work for you?

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.850
Oh, I see the, uh, yeah, you pass the interview. I think that may be in the fine print that

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.490
goes to managers or cause that that's bad as well. All right. That's not, um, I sort of implied that

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.560
wouldn't be, uh, that wouldn't be an issue, but we'll, we'll see what happens. I don't think that's

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.760
a huge issue fast forwarding. And first of all, uh, one of the great things to tell people about

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.920
working at a big company like Microsoft, I guess big strong word, huge, massive,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.800
gigantuous, um, is that you can change jobs without leaving the company, which is, I think

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.560
sort of a good advantage. You can try new things, new products, even new roles at the company.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.880
I've always, I guess that's both good and bad because there's a lot of people who are,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.760
uh, they're learning has been stunted, uh, working only at Microsoft because they haven't

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.680
paid attention to anything going on outside the walls of Microsoft. It's a pro and con like

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.880
you, if you go to a smaller company, let's say you went to Netflix or something like that,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:32.820
um, right. If, if you get to a point in your career where you've, you feel like you've done

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.860
learning what you wanted to learn there, you really have to leave that company right here.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.420
We have people who really enjoy their jobs and stay in that position for, I know people

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.460
who have stayed in their job for 15 years. I know, I know. And I, there are pros and cons

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.580
to that too. Cons for me mostly. I couldn't stand that. I can't either. My resume is filled with,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.580
um, I'm actually, it's a very proud point for me. I've done just about everything you can. I've

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:09.140
done API, I've done UI, I've done service, I've done consumer, I've done, uh, enterprise, uh,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:18.050
servers. It's for me, that aspect of Microsoft is fantastic. I can just, um, whenever I decide to

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.290
leave a team, I go, what do I want to learn next? Uh, and who's got a position opening that?

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.700
Very cool. Yes. Uh, so what the, there was a point I was getting to and it was around peer feedback

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.740
and I want to really, uh, I was brainstorming this with a friend of ours the other day and

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.460
you know, we've tried the, let me tell you about the peer feedback system we have right now at

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.300
Microsoft. It's completely ineffective because the way it works is the way it works today is I say,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:55.520
hey, Bob, Joe and Fred, can you please provide feedback to me knowing that Bob, Joe and Fred

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.200
really liked me and they will say great things about me and my manager has to take that with

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:06.340
a grain of salt. Uh, and a good manager may reach out to some other people and ask them for

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.740
feedback and it's if they feel like it and it's not a great system for getting objective feedback.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.580
So the idea that came out of this brainstorm, which I, I've had several

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.820
brainstorm on this in the past and one was for those who had been around the internet for a long,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.700
long time in the nineties or mid mid to late nineties, there was a site called Am I hot or not?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.660
And, um, the idea was you see pictures of people, you'd rate them and then you'd

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.500
seen an appropriate picture and close web browser and hope you never came back to the site again.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.170
But the idea was over, it was crowdsourcing whether you were hot or not moving forward,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.490
not what we're doing here, but the, my joking proposition that started from was

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.130
am I a good employee or not? Where people see me a little bio about me and the people I've

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.450
worked with and they go, yeah, I like working with him or no, I don't. Um, not the plan I'm

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.970
suggesting someone is coding that right now in their office. Yes, it's the miracle. Uh,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:10.380
but what if, and I'll throw this out to you Brent, uh, what if you were required

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.780
to submit, not just solicit feedback to submit feedback, you're required. You need to give

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:23.340
feedback on five people a quarter or 10 people a year, some, some number that could increase as

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.860
your level band increases or could stay flat, but you have to, you're required to give feedback

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:39.740
to a minimum of N number of people, uh, per year. And even better, you know, how, um, uh, in any

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.020
social networking site, review site, you can, or Amazon reviews, you can like someone's comment or

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.100
give a thumbs up or thumbs down as a manager reading the feedback. Uh, I want to rate you

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.740
as a person who gives feedback by saying this feedback was useful. This feedback was not useful.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:05.700
So the one aspect, I'm trying to encourage, uh, the goal here is to get people to submit feedback,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:14.900
uh, that, and not just for quantity, but for give valuable feedback that evaluates their peers,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:22.100
people they work with, and also, um, want to be viewed as a good feedback giver. Uh, so that's the

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.500
idea I'm floating around in my head now, not that I'm in charge of HR. Any of this will happen, but

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:33.460
I, but, but the last thing I'll say is I have a good track record of throwing out random ideas,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:40.900
which aren't really that random and, uh, seeing some of them adopted, it's probably pure

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.700
serendipity. In fact, it's entirely pure serendipity, but there's my, there's my plan. Brent,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:52.660
throw in your ideas. So the, your idea is we have some sort of peer feedback site someplace.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:10:00.580
Everyone has to contribute to it. So instead of me requesting from others, I have to pick,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:09.390
uh, and number of people and provide them feedback. Correct. And I assume this end would not be in my

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:19.580
directs. Correct. Okay. Um, and then other people, let's say for me, other people who have chosen me

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:29.010
to, to give me feedback, um, they, they can come in and they can see other people's feedback.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.840
I don't know if they can or not. I don't think so. You mentioned this sort of plus one or no,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.080
that's, that's for the manager. That's for the, so your manager sees your feedback and they go

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.880
through it and this person says, Brent's great. He's got a nice smile. And, and the manager has

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.340
to fill out this. Was this feedback helpful? And he says, heck no. Then someone gives a lot of more,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.700
a lot of better constructive feedback or positive feedback. It's like, this gives me a good idea

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.430
of how Brent works. That's, you know, that's thumbs up. That helps the manager, but more

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:02.430
importantly, my idea is once you get a collection of feedback, that's ongoing about somebody, I,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:08.270
my hunch is if I can read that, I have an idea of how they work and a little bit more inside of them

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:15.090
than a review and rewards and those things. Yeah. It reminds me a lot of the, the college

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:22.530
interview process we used to have here where we would send out interviewers and then, uh,

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:28.690
I, I haven't done Cal campus recruiting in quite a while, but the recruiters themselves

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:35.330
get rated on their ability, uh, to get, to pick flybacks that actually get accepted.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:43.390
That could work. The, there's a lot of subjective bias in that system though.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.860
The first off, like the, the, the manager, let's say you come in and you say something that's

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:59.890
totally viable, but I could care less about your principles since they contradict mine.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:06.290
That's totally fine. The manager, I still want that feedback and the value in that more value.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:10.370
Look managers, we have bad managers discarding feedback all over the place,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:17.090
but the value in that feedback in aggregate is that, uh, over time I can get a better picture

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:22.370
of how this person works for future managers. So I'm also thinking of this in sort of the

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:30.660
data-driven engineering culture, right? Cause we'd also have you presumably sending feedback

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.700
to multiple different, uh, employees under different managers. Sure. And then we'd

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:46.130
have the manager's ability to rate feedback and be able to compare, um, hey, Allen's feedback

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:53.650
turns out this one guy consistently hates feedback of this sort. Uh, this other, I think

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:59.090
there's some valuable data mining you can give. I think you can look at, again, in, in aggregate

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:04.620
in big data, once you've done this for awhile and you can start to get some really interesting

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.700
insights. And again, it's not everything and your fit and value to the team and your value

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.820
to Microsoft at reward time is worth a lot more. I mean, pure feedback. I want to be more of that.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.540
But it still has to be about output and technical contribution and product impact and, and those

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:26.060
things as well. The thing is, but we do a really bad job figuring out if someone people, if someone

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.670
is collaborative, someone can work with other people. The, we did a, we did a similar, uh, we

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:41.550
did a process when me, one of my peers at the last review where we basically, um, evaluated each

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:47.950
of the new three topics, like how well you do results and how well you basically leverage others

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:53.780
and proactively contribute to others. And we kind of went very deep in all three of those topics for

00:13:53.780 --> 00:14:03.980
each of our guys. And we found it using period feedback. We found it very hard. Um, the one

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:11.870
challenge is if, if I'm able to select five people or no. So actually I think it's actually

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:18.750
to brainstorm further. I think it needs to be both ice. I select five people because, uh, and

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:25.310
five people are individuals also have to select five people in which they review.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:32.210
Perhaps. And the primary reason why I would suggest that is, uh, we do have people who

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.330
like to spend their time in their office. Uh, we also have, like, you don't know what you

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:42.130
don't know. You're right. So you do need to, there's a chance with that program that there'll

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:47.900
be people who don't get feedback at all. And this is a case where, especially in the short term,

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.580
not going to be overwhelmed by too much data. I think if you gather those and, and, oh, more

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:59.820
work to do, like, look, it doesn't take it's, it's minimal, but over time, as we get more of

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.740
this data, we can figure out, Oh, this, this one of these doesn't work. We're going to stop

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.980
doing it. Or one of these works. Well, it could be that you can use the data to help tweak the

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.780
system. I have an improvement suggestion. I have, I already have 10 in my head from this

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:22.370
conversation so far. So go ahead. The, the, so an individual, let's say it's n right. The,

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:28.260
the number of feedback that they have to fill out, it could be ladder level. It can be whatever

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:35.700
at some point in time where the, that poor soul doesn't end up with a feedback burnout.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.320
Right. We don't want to, we don't want to get it to the point where they're like,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.760
I think you build a code. I'm just going to copy and paste what I said for Alan for this guy.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.000
No. And let me, let me pause there because that's a definite trap to fall into because we do feedback

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
one time a year when I get this pile of requests and, and you know, I let mine pile up

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.730
and I do them and then I put them in there. The idea of my original idea of, you know,

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:08.880
me choosing to give feedback is a sentence in, in the moment, sort of in the moment, like,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.920
well, Scott really helped me figure this thing out and I couldn't have done it without him.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.440
And it was outside the scope of his job. I'm going to give that feedback. I'm going to just

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.840
chuck that in there somewhere, whatever, whatever the mechanism is, but I'd rather do

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.880
it in the moment than one time a year when I've completely forgotten about that event.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:34.670
So now I have two ideas. The idea on this one is let them select a few of those folks,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:44.560
but the rest is selected for them via, you know, could scratch your email, it could email the

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.360
good hierarchy. Yeah, whatever. Right. And then it's, and then it's sort of a random sampling.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:57.520
The second thing, this is my favorite feedback trick. I use this quite often. I don't know

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:05.120
if I've ever walked you through it before. This was taught to me by a peer years and years ago.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:12.740
So I'll just run you through it if you don't mind. I don't mind. Okay. Alan. Brett.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:19.900
Step one, what I would like you to do is rate during our last podcast, not this one,

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:27.340
but our last podcast, rate your expectations of me from one to 10 of rate how well I achieved

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:33.260
your expectations of me from one to 10 in our last podcast. All right. 10 is the most awesome. Yep.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:40.180
What's your rating? Oh, you want me out loud? Yeah. One to 10. Uh, eight. Eight. Awesome.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.400
Because I have low expectations of you and you nailed almost all of them.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.840
That was sweet. Now that this is the important question, what could I have done differently

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.560
in our last podcast such that your answer to the prior question would have been a 10.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.600
You could have put your damn face closer to the microphone.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:06.350
Okay. If I had, if I had done everything in the podcast and I had put my face close to the

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.270
microphone, would that have make it a 10? Uh, that would bring it to it. That would bring it

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.630
to a nine. I've changed it. My first score cause you did a lot. That's a seven. That'd bring you

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:20.270
to a nine. Okay. What else could I have done? So when I edit, uh, the less I have to edit

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:25.620
of you making weird sounds out of your mouth, weird sounds. Yeah. I'll send you an outtake.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:37.070
That might be why I'm staying far away from the measure book. All right. Anyway, so the,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:44.590
that very quick feedback loop, something like that, I would love to have peer feedback. And in,

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:51.500
in addition to that, uh, the, the random selection, you can time box it and say

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.780
your expectations of this individual in the last three months, what we captured there was

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:03.840
an evaluation of and translated to a work situation. It's an evaluation to how perception

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:11.340
of accomplishing a task expectations. What's missing. And that's not what I'm worried about.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.900
We'll get that. Maybe, maybe I should be, but what I'm more worried about is we don't seem to

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:25.330
care enough, careful, let's use my words here about actual collaboration and working with others.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:31.010
And you didn't that, that, that, that, that evaluation didn't capture that. I want to be able

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:37.090
to change the, so if you, if you saw what I did first off is I said, give me a reading

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.970
due to some expectation. Now you can change that expectation. You could say,

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:47.410
give me a reading from one to 10 of how well you, you felt I collaborated in the last three

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:53.010
months or how well you feel I am as a manager or how well you feel I am as a developer or

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.490
whatever. Now the brilliant thing about that is it actually doesn't matter.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:02.530
You're going to go all the way to brilliant. Yes, all the way. There are better things than

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:06.450
brilliant, but the brilliant thing about that is it doesn't matter what your rating is.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:12.960
What that rating does is it forces you to sort of make your own relative.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:21.630
I think it's a good system, but a different system. Sure. And, and maybe with different

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.750
input and different results. But the great thing is another great thing about a big company before

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:35.550
we move on is, uh, we could AB test not in the, in the Alan Brent testing podcast, but in traditional

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.710
AB testing where we could run experiments in this division, we're going to do this in this

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.710
division or this part of this division. We're going to do this. Um, it would be great if we,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:50.860
I want to do data driven HR. That would be awesome. And I don't know why.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.580
I don't know that I could get my boss to buy into that. Bet you, your boss would buy into that.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:21:02.850
There come my boss's boss. Wouldn't yeah. Yeah. But no boss to shield you from your boss's boss.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.450
Hey, my, my boss is fully supportive of am I a good employee or not?

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:14.030
Alan, do it. Do it. Uh, the other thing, the other thing that you may not have noticed that

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:21.070
is something of a huge passion for me, I truly believe that everybody is awesome.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:29.380
But everybody has behaviors that suck, particularly in the environment or in the expectations.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:36.900
And so trying to use peer feedback to tug out what are those behaviors that may not fit well

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.860
in, in, we talk about systems thinking in the, in the new system that this person is trying to

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:48.720
join. Um, I've had people who back in the days, I remember with this one guy who was a tester

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.680
who hated testing and I sat him down and I'm like, look, you don't like to do any of the

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.320
things around testing. It wasn't about the activity, but his behaviors show

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:07.600
you don't like this. You like PM, go get a PM job. And, and he was a repeat, uh,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:14.830
three Oh, back in those days, three Oh was hugely bad. Uh, with that encouragement,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:21.070
he went on and he, um, ended up being a repeat four Oh four or five employee in that new role.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:26.350
Yeah. There's, uh, I made that invention in the podcast for, but a big fan of the grid that

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.990
Michael Lott talks about in his fantastic management book called managing humans and

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:36.030
the skill in the will quadrant and you have high skill, you have basically can bucket

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:40.990
your employees into four groups, high skill, high will high, high skill, low will low skill,

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:46.110
high will and low skill, low will. And the idea is that each of those is a different sort of

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:50.610
management challenge or different management approach. When you have your high skill, high

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.850
will employees, the ones that just there, the awesome people, you can't just leave them alone.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:23:00.290
You got to make sure they maintain challenge and keep them there. You have low skill, high will,

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.530
like this is like your typical like college hire. I want to do, I want to do a little puppy dog,

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:09.170
but get them to make sure they get the right training or, or coaching or mentoring so they can

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:14.050
get the skills they need to get up into that high skill, high will. Same thing with the low

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.330
will high skill. A lot of times like your guy, they're just in the wrong job. Like I'm really

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.890
capable. I'm really smart, but I don't like what I'm doing or I don't like the product I'm working

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:29.170
on. You need to, as a manager, it's your job to get your whole team to try and juggle your

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.970
whole team into that high skill, high will bucket. Or if they're just low skill, low will,

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.290
and it's not the wrong job, you just hired a putz, you know, find a way to deal with them in

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:43.410
the appropriate way as well. There's another tool that I'm, I'm familiar with. I've talked with

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:49.490
Alan in the past, the influencer series. They talk about a similar thing, which is motivation and

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:57.100
ability. Right. Motivation. You can get people to change both of these, but a lot of the times

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.580
it's not worth the ROI. It's important for, and we're off the topic here, but it's important for

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:09.060
managers to recognize that you're, you have an employee who just may not be, it may be a great

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.300
employee, but not the best employee for your team. And if your job is a manager, if they're not cutting

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.820
it on your team, but you see potential there, it's your job to find them the right fit on the team,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:24.820
on your org or somewhere else at Microsoft. And people, people forget that too often.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.980
So what are we concluding on the, uh, I don't know. I'm, I'm, a couple of things came out of

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:35.060
that. I'm curious if there are any examples in the industry of data driven HR. So if anybody knows of

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.420
any of those, I think you brought up an example last time around, uh, no, it was, no, that wasn't

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:47.380
data driven. That was data analysis on HR. Google look at, let's look at the feedback we've done

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.420
over the last 10 years and do some analysis on that. And they said all the KPIs we've been using

00:24:53.140 --> 00:25:00.580
suck. Well, again, and you can, I'm not going to rehash the last podcast. Uh, I think that

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:07.140
we're, I love the, again, I like the direction I was about to say love, but I like the direction

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:14.620
we're making some changes. Uh, like with me, I always like to see more, a little more extreme.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:20.220
So I want to see if, and I think peer feedback is one getting that right will help us the system

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:25.660
we have now. We may as well not do it. That's, that's, that's my closing. Yeah. It's, it's

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.540
Pointly. We talked about Google and one of the things, uh, Google does on peer feedback

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:39.500
is you can select, um, six people. I don't know. It's a budget. They, they change it

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.820
frequently, but the peer bonus system. No, no, I'm talking about peer feedback. So this is what

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.860
I last heard is, is that you as an individual can select, uh, six people very similar to

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:55.740
what we have here, but anybody who wants to, this is different from here.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.460
Anybody who wants to can proactively add feedback. Yeah. I don't know about that.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:07.540
I haven't paid attention. It just, that one change would be a huge value out here.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:12.420
Let's experiment. Try some things out. Stephen Johnson, one of my authoring heroes was at

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.420
Microsoft yesterday. I got a chance to meet him and, and get a second copy of his books. I

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.000
can have one autographed. That's pretty cool. His, uh, sounds like a public service announcement,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.680
which it probably is because he did his last book called how we get to now, um, which is

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.560
based on a nugget from his last book, which I, which I have read like three times now where

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.800
good ideas come from, which if you've heard me talk at all about testing, I steal liberally from

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:43.470
him. I told him that he was cool. He didn't punch me, but how we get to now, he filmed as

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:49.170
a PBS series at the same time he wrote it. So he would go out and get the ideas and do

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.770
the research and they'd film for like 10 hours. Then he'd go back and do a bunch of writing

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.930
or vice versa. He'd write about something and then they go film it. But there's a PBS series.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:02.530
It's the third episode is maybe fourth. Anyway, it's six episodes, six parts of the book

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:11.120
on these great, uh, connections of ideas and innovation through history. Uh, quick story from

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.360
yesterday. He has a great example of, you know, there was a, I'm going to paraphrase this horribly.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.320
That's what I do. There was a printing plant and the ink was running. So they

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.640
that guy there is trying to figure out how to dehumidify the air and he figured it out.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.080
And the machine he made had the side effect of cooling off the room as well.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.000
People liked that. I started eating lunch in the printing room because it was nice and cool in

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.320
there. They maybe were onto something and out of the end, a couple of years later or several

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.880
years later, they were able to build, um, air conditioning units that would work in a house.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.200
And that drove air conditioning. The invention of that, which came out of a dehumidifier for

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:55.440
a printing plant actually drove large scale migration of people to areas like, uh, Phoenix,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.880
South Florida, Las Vegas, you know, turn of the century, just turn of last century,

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.440
a hundred years ago, there were like 150 people leave living in Las Vegas. And now it's the

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.720
fastest growing city in the, like in the country. Uh, and all that's due to the, to dehumidifying.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.400
And then he talks about how that goes into how it actually has affected the political

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.400
climate of political races and, and all kinds of great connections. He's great at drawing

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:23.200
these connections. And which makes sense. Cause he's the guy that learned where

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.680
ideas come from and where do ideas come from, Brent?

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.650
Uh, unicorn rainbow land.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:35.170
They come from other ideas. And, uh, anyway, uh, I'm a huge fan of his, uh,

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:41.570
I think anyone, anyone interested in coming up with new ideas, if you're, if you're fine,

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.420
have you read Shapiro yet? Stephen Shapiro.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:52.540
Yes. Yeah. He's he's, I have not read Stephen Johnson, but I, I'm all in on Shapiro and

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.860
it's very much along those same lines. And what I would say with Stephen Johnson,

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.900
with, um, I have, and to be fair, I've only read like the first half a chapter of the new book.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:08.270
Uh, but where ideas come from, where good ideas come from, if you actually don't care

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.990
about coming up with new ideas and you're fine, just doing it, you're told,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:15.950
probably don't need to read it. But if you actually want to, uh, figure out where ideas

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.550
come from and how to come up with good ideas of your own and how to think about that,

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:24.030
you gotta go read where good ideas come from. And I've read, uh, he's written nine books.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:30.030
I've written, I've read, I've written, I've read about half. I read everything bad is good

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.790
for you and the ghost map and, um, and where good ideas come from, which math,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:42.030
I read a third of his book. I'll, I'll, I'll increase that to just under half when I finish,

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:48.110
uh, where, um, so, so you guys, you guys in podcast lane can't, can't see Allen when he's

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:53.710
thinking about Stephen Johnson, but it is clear. He has a major bromance for this guy.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:58.220
Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting a little embarrassed and little flustered.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:06.140
All right. Hey, um, one last thing before we get going is, uh, maybe one next to last thing,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.300
but right. You wanted to talk a little bit about sort of the not invented to hear syndrome,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:15.740
what that means for business. Yeah. So we've talked about this quite a bit.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:27.090
And there's a situation currently happening in my org. Uh, it, it, it frustrates me quite a bit.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:32.770
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna share it on the podcast, but I'm wondering, maybe Alan, you could,

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:38.980
you could brainstorm with me in the time we have remaining today around, how can we accelerate

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:51.390
learning in the organization in a nutshell? What we have is we have a well-known bad decision

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:59.440
that has occurred in, in business. Okay. Well-known bad decision, a bunch of teams.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:08.400
I would say somewhere around 50 people working hard to replace, uh, the, the assets built as a

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:18.800
result of that bad decision. And we're, we're in a phase, uh, where multiple teams in, in a specific

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:26.240
context, this is around a data pipeline, which, which I argue is the, the test harness. No,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.480
I was thinking the same thing. Yeah. It was, it was the test harness for a long time. And now,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.560
now that every team wrote, we have, oh, we have a test harness harness. It's great.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:42.320
Now it's the data pipeline. Yeah. The, the, the difference though, is back in the old

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:49.500
school days, if you didn't build a test harness, you still could ship, right? You work 40 hour

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:55.580
days. Everyone's bug bashing in the last month. Fun. Yeah. I mean, it's not efficient. It's

00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.700
quite painful, but you could still ship. But in these days, if you don't have a good data pipeline,

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:12.290
um, your business is hurt. Period. And so what we're seeing is, is a lot of NIH around data pipes.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:20.340
NIH is not invented here for the acronym, uh, weary. Yes. And, and, uh, there's a human condition

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:29.940
where we're prebuilt to, to believe that other people's ideas are stupid and mine is awesome.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.260
And I battle that. I, there's a phrase that you'll hear in my hallway quite often that

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:43.020
NIH is awesome. Not invented here is bonus. Let's go. Um, anyway,

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:51.390
there was a decision that looks like it's in flight. It was made, uh, in isolation. Uh,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:55.870
it hasn't been vetted with all the other executives, but one executive basically very

00:32:55.870 --> 00:33:02.690
recently has made a decision that it's going to lead us down a path that's remarkably similar

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:11.540
to the one we just, um, got ourselves unburied. And not only that, this is much bigger. And,

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:18.850
and so what I find myself puzzling is how do we prevent this going forward? Why is this

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:26.260
learning at this level so hard? I don't think it's that hard. I, I, I do think about this a lot

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.260
and I have a great story I'll share in a moment, which will make yours seem mellow in comparison.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:39.460
I think ego tends to Trump invention in non-learning organizations. And what I mean by that

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.740
is I commonly see, you know, I think non-invented here comes from ego comes from,

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.380
I, nobody else could come up with a better idea than me. This must be the best idea.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:55.620
I have been here for 20 years and I know. And I also believe that, like I mentioned a few

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:01.940
minutes ago from Steven Johnson, good ideas come from other ideas and learning orgs, uh, and

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:08.100
another book recommendation, one always knew that the outside edge of my bookshelf is, uh,

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.700
Peter Zingay's, uh, the fifth discipline, which is a learning organization.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:18.900
I think a learning organization in tech comes a lot from small experiments that fail. Like

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.660
if I want to have a new data pipeline, I want to think, I want to brainstorm every little bit

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:29.140
of it and come up with at least a few, one or two or sorry, not one, at least two or three

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:35.380
different options for each part and give, let some people go investigate, not two to three

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:41.790
week investigations. I want, I want little short investigations that include an investigation could

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.230
be, here's an idea how to do it. Let me understand more why this didn't work,

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:51.940
why something still didn't work in the past. I think, and that's where those ideas coming

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.700
together, have those teams get together and do a little brainstorm, a little, little,

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.970
probably different than a scrum meeting, but a little half hour, like here's what I thought of

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:04.050
and let those ideas bounce off each other. And then you're going to come up with something

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:10.900
that's a lot better. Uh, I think when you just think this is the right way, I really

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:17.140
can't think of another way. In fact, I think this is from Weinberg. I can't remember a bit

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:23.060
when I'm thinking for a solution for a really difficult problem. I want to come up with three

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.810
ideas for it. Cause I don't know, you know, I might think of one and well, this one's the best one

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.970
for sure. And then I'll force myself. Well, let me think of two other ways I could do this.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:37.570
And often, not always, but often I find something in that second or third solution and,

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.490
and not just me, but myself, but working with others, because that's how I believe these

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:46.850
things need to happen. I got something in my eye. Um, but when you think from the beginning

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:51.810
that you have a solution and there isn't, there won't be another way to do it, uh, regardless of

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:57.890
whether it's repeats a bad decision you made before, it's probably a bad decision. There's a,

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:03.570
there's a couple of things. First off, um, I do the same thing in terms of coming up with three

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:11.010
solutions and, and it's very interesting because I, I've actually been teaching people this. I've

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:15.410
now taught it four times in the last week and the last time I've taught it to someone who was

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:21.970
five years ago. So there's this weird sort of coincidence thing. Basically what I do is when

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:29.120
you need to come up with alternatives for brainstorming, solution number one, what is the

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:37.820
high cost but low risk solution? Solution number three is what is the low cost but high risk

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:46.220
solution? And then solution number two is the one that's medium cost, medium risk. And starting

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:54.300
with those things, you, you end up getting the two scales and then, uh, you're able to converge on

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.580
what would be a good in between that allows us to be flexible. Perhaps one, one technique I use a lot

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.620
is the, um, look at these extremes for any, any technical problem or any adaptive problem. Look at

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:09.660
what one extreme versus the other, whether it's those criteria and others, and then take the

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:15.100
best from both sides and figure it out. The other thing that, that I picked up from your,

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:23.410
your guidance is it implies that if we could somehow come up with a way to measure the

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:31.360
maturity model of an organization around how they are, are a learning organization. Right.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.500
There's a heuristic that as you were talking, it reminds me of,

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:42.300
they're still very dominant. This philosophy within our company around betting the farm.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:50.620
And I'm like, I've, I've now after seen this for, for several months in the last two years played out,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:57.820
I actually think that that's a heuristic for someone who's low on that maturity model. The,

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:04.880
what you're talking about, uh, with the, the, the printer ink not drawing, right? I, I thought of

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:11.040
it in terms of Reese's concepts of pivot and persevere. The guys invented something that

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:17.920
solved this problem, but they then very quickly understood the behavior of human beings given

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:24.480
this new environment. And they recognized, Hey, wait a minute. There's likely a significantly

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.520
more valuable idea in terms of the usage of this asset we just built.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.240
Steven Johnson calls those when you fail to do that, those blind spots. And they're very common.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:41.360
There was a guy ahead of Edison who invented a way to record music on a, on a cylinder.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.800
He thought that was fantastic. And it was kind of developed out of his idea that people take

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:52.240
shorthand. I'll make this thing that records and then they'll learn how to read the waves in this

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:59.440
recording and be able to transcribe it. Uh, he, it didn't even occur to him that people might want

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:05.780
to listen to what had been recorded. He could record, but it couldn't, and the fact that it

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:11.440
couldn't play back, not even on his radar. And, but I was, I was, wait, wait, what problem was

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.280
he solving? He wanted to be able to record something so that, and his idea was that well,

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:20.480
once it's recorded, people can look at the wave. You can do a little, a little, look at the

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:25.280
waves and the wax and transcribe that into words. He thought it would be a new, new,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.720
new form of shorthand. Oh, he was trying to, he was trying to automate transcription. Yeah.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.320
So he missed and we see that happen. I heard that. I go, I've seen that happen about a hundred

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.240
times, at least in software engineering where I have this and I see it actually come out of

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.480
research a lot where the great thing we have super smart people in Microsoft research. And I

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.840
come up with great ideas. It goes, I developed this thing that does this. And you go, well,

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.040
that's not interesting at all. But if I take it and then do this with it, now it's super

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:58.640
valuable. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. I've been kind of situations where I've done, I was trying to do

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:04.930
this and it completely failed, but I'm sharing and I look at it. I'm like, do you not see what

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:11.970
you have? All right. We're almost at a time. Hey, I want to tell my story. So years ago,

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:18.690
I was involved. I was actually the principal, the key person involved in trying to acquire some

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:27.120
really cool technology from Microsoft. I had talked to the owners of the program. People,

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:35.360
excitement at Microsoft was high. Cost was relatively cheap. It's like, oh my gosh,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.760
this is going to happen. We're like, it was very exciting time. Started floating it around,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:45.040
you know, and trying to figure out an idea of how much scale we need. And the VP of one

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:55.380
major product at Microsoft said he vetoed it. He said, this program, this platform offers features

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.100
that we may implement sometime in the future. So we don't want it to compete. So I don't want it

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:07.580
here at Microsoft. And I said, the deal was done. The deal is off. What? And I have to leave it.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.540
I'll leave it at that for now, but it's funny that we may want to implement the features in

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:18.460
the company we're trying to acquire. So he said, our product may implement many of these features

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.540
sometime. So we don't want to have that here because it'll take away from our future growth.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.520
Yeah, that was the line. Is that VP still here? I don't know. I don't know. I can tell you though,

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.000
recently, there's been a resurgence of a huge number of people saying,

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.240
saying, hey, we should get this product here. And they searched the internal web and they found

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.960
these documents I wrote six, seven years ago. Say, hey, whatever happened with this? And I sadly tell

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:51.040
them probably even a less interesting version of that story. But I think we really missed out big

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:58.400
time on a chance to become a learning organization. So that line just blows me away. Our product's

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:04.160
going to have this stuff someday. So maybe. So we don't want to spend this minimal amount

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:10.620
of money to have it here. Does that product have it? No, absolutely not. Nothing even close.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:16.380
And have you recently done any sort of update check in terms of the status of that company?

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.100
Yeah. Here's the funny part. Yeah, they're still around. They're more popular than ever.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:27.340
Much harder for us to get it on site than it was then. I still have the contacts. It's funny. I

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:32.460
still have the contacts who tell me behind the curtain that, sure, we'll help you get it set up.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:39.100
But there's still NIH around that from the interested parties now. And so even though

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:43.810
I honestly could get them here for a price that Microsoft could afford and be economical,

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:51.250
given the value. Maybe I missed it. This is a company we're trying to acquire or a service

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:56.590
we wanted to bring in-house. A service we wanted to bring in-house. Oh, I hate this.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:02.350
Yes. Anyway, when I think of not invented here, this is a story that grinds me more than any.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:08.030
And I think it's a loss of opportunity. So last time, the time before, I was talking about the

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:11.550
third party that we were going with. And we hit some of that when we were

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:20.820
flooding the proposal. Because there is another team who's trying to build those services. And I said,

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:27.710
that's fantastic. We're going to go with this because we need it now. And here's our design. And

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:34.910
we're going to design it such that we can flip the switch. I hope that approach becomes a prototype

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:42.110
and a practice we can see more of at Microsoft. But I think you're still in the rare bucket.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:51.620
Yeah, for me, it's just time is of essence. We don't have the time to wait for you to light

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:57.540
up this feature. We need it now. And it's cheaper than putting- We don't have to serialize.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.980
Right. Right. And we'd- Yeah. All right. We're out of time. So, hey, fun podcast today,

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.980
Brett. Yeah. Thank you. How do you do today? I'll let you know after you turn the mic off.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:13.220
Hey, everybody. Thanks again for listening. Yep. I'm Alan. I'm Brett. And we'll see you next time.
