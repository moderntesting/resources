WEBVTT

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.980
Hey everybody. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're here for episode 57.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.060
57 at AB testing. Once again, counting down the long, long road to 100.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.710
As well as we have our predictions for the end of year episode.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.430
Yeah. Wait, it's not the end of the year. It's not yet.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.270
We are doing something special here on AB testing,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.990
something we've done once before in a slightly different variation. Yes.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.850
And special might be sort of short bus special.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.570
Many of you, many of the three may remember we had Steve Roe on the show

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.130
maybe a year ago, a while ago.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.010
I don't remember the number because I don't remember the number.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.250
No, we have a guest on the show as well, but we are recording remotely.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.110
And yeah, I'm thinking you're already doing your pre-editing comments

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.390
around why the audio is all messed up.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.630
No, it's going to sound great.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.590
We have one thing to do before we introduce our guest. Oh, OK.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.950
Did you know what that is, Brent? I do. You do.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.350
I do. There's this handy thing we do every episode.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.510
And that is write it up on what we're going to the topics on the board.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.550
It is. And then that's so Alan doesn't forget.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.150
But this is really exciting.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.430
We have this show is brought to you by Cobaton spelled K O B I T O N.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.110
You may not have heard of it yet. It's pretty darn brand new.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.150
So I have a question for you.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.590
Is managing internal devices, those of you testing like mobile devices

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.030
and exciting the best part of your job?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.990
I doubt it. So you should check out Cobaton,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.630
your complete mobile device lab solution.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.430
Cobaton allows you to manage the devices you own and access

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.990
the real devices you need from manual to automation testing.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.910
Cobaton empowers developers and testers to build great products faster,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.070
manage and access internal and external devices all in one place,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.670
allowing you to test on hundreds of devices and configurations,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.310
identify and resolve issues more quickly with automatically created activity logs,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.710
even centralize your testing history to increase collaboration

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.590
across teams and locations.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.590
Cobaton does all of that while minimizing cost

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.870
and enabling you to get your app to market sooner.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.760
Now, if you couldn't tell, I was reading that.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.560
But I wanted to jump in a minute and say I took some time to play with Cobaton,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.000
as did I. And it's pretty darn cool.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.160
It's a lot like, you know, test droid or sauce labs.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.760
But to me, I I didn't do a side by side comparison, but they have.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.360
I think the I think the technical term is a butt load of different devices,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.600
not emulated real devices you can connect to poke around on manually,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.960
run your scripts, as well as one thing I like.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.800
It's really cool.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.280
I'm not sure if any of the other places support this.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.080
But if you have some custom devices like some Xiaomi devices from Japan,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.640
from China or something, you can plug them in and have them accessible

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.260
to your team anywhere in the world.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.460
That when I looked at it, the first thing I was reminded of

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.060
was my time in Bing.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.500
And I'm like, oh, my goodness, this is like what Selenium was to browser testing.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.940
This is is to device.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.100
Yeah, seriously, if you're doing a lot of mobile testing,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.020
you have to have some sort of cloud solution.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.780
And Cobaton looks pretty awesome.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.260
If I was in the app development space, I would I would seriously be considering

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.740
what the price tag is for this.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.940
For those of you who have done app compact, particularly device compact,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.980
that is a big barrier to entry.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.420
Yeah. And it's a shared pool across your whole team.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.140
So you can anyway.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.060
My view is always try before you buy.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.740
So if you visit cobaton.com and we'll put this in the show notes,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.060
cobaton.com, whack A B testing as KOB ITO and dot com slash A B testing.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.700
You can sign up for a free trial, free trial and start checking it out

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.460
in a few minutes. So pretty cool.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.140
I would recommend trying it out because I thought it was awesome.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.020
And I have kind of high standards.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.740
All right. So finally, with all that, blah, blah, blah.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.700
I am very excited to have Hans Buell on the show today.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.980
Hans has been working with information technology since his high school years.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.020
In his career, Hans has gained experience as a developer, manager

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.620
and principal consultant for companies and organizations worldwide.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.020
He was a pioneer of the keyword approach to testing and automation

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.260
now widely used throughout the industry.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.300
His approach is a testing action based testing and soap opera testing

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.780
have helped a variety of customers achieve scalable and maintainable

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.420
solutions for large and complex testing challenges.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.540
Hans is a frequent speaker at Star Conferences

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.580
as the lead author of Integrated Test Design and Automation.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.820
Welcome Hans to A B testing. Hi, Hans.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.700
You are not really dead, right?

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.820
I memorize that, of course. Of course.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.710
How are you doing today? Thanks for joining us.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.870
I'm good. So Hans, we have to apologize

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.790
for all the pain and hassle we've put you through.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.470
What you guys don't know because of the magic of podcast land

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.750
is we took up a good hour of Hans time about a week ago,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.900
trying to struggle through getting a three person audio recording up on Zencaster.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.260
So I wasn't going to throw like a product under the bus, but I guess we just did.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.860
No, I'm I'm willing to state

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.900
that somehow magically it was our fault.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.860
But there wasn't too many levers to to pull and too many buttons

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.940
and options to change on Zencaster.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.220
So it's still a bit of a mystery as to why that didn't work.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.500
Cool. Hey, I want to get I want to get into the show.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.540
And because I've been talking a lot, I'm going to make Hans talk.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.900
So we have a theme for the show today, which is the role of test design

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.580
for successful automation.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.740
And I've always been huge on test design.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.780
And I think it's far more difficult than most people give give it credit for.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.380
So, Hans, I'm going to kick this right off to you.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.940
And so given that given that I've already given my opinion on it,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.060
but not a definition, what is test design to you?

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.740
Well, of course, this test design in general is something you do to get good tests.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.420
But when I talk about test design for automation,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:46.300
I mean, how you design and design and organize your test to get your automation right.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.900
And that's kind of counterintuitive.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.300
And when you think about automation, you think mainly as a technical challenge.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.980
And you need to be a good engineer to do good automation,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.580
and especially your functional testing.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.060
But what you do, what I found over the years

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.780
is that it actually the design of the test have a big impact

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.420
on how well they can be maintained later on.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:22.980
Now, here, when you say a test design, your test is specifically the test cases.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.550
Yes. Yeah, kind of.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.390
The way we do it in our company with our method action based testing

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.230
is we follow a modular approach.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.390
So you organize your testing modules.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.910
We call those test modules.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.430
Think of spreadsheets.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.590
And you in the test module, you can have more than one test case

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:53.990
that kind of can form a negative to test your system and the test.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.060
So we do not necessarily design it and have a test case.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.660
First, let me first try to identify those test modules and organize that.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.530
Is a module in this light

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:14.290
because similar to like a test suite or an organizational construct

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.690
for your test cases at the I went up and looked at the website

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.370
and I was a bit confused on the module concept

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.570
because it's that is also a common term in in development.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.410
So I wasn't certain if we talk about this,

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.210
if you're talking about the test automation side

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.930
or the first part of organizing and understanding

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.810
what you wanted to automate eventually.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.400
Well, the comparison to system development is actually a good one.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.120
When you create a system, when you develop a system,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.920
you will organize your code into code modules or code files

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.560
or whatever you want to call it.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.600
And then in that file, you will have a bunch of functions or methods.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.440
And it is a class.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.840
So what you will not do is put all these functions out there

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.360
in isolation.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.200
You will organize them in a certain way,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.200
in subsystems, in modules, etc.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.640
And that's what we advocate for testing as well.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.080
And you should not see the test cases as just isolated units,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.000
which you should try to tie them together into design products,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.400
which we call the modules.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.400
Now, the test suite is in my model is a little bit different.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.760
That is more like how you execute a test.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.200
So a test suite might say, I'm going to run this test module,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.160
I'm going to run that test module,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.440
maybe a third test module,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.880
I only run a few of the test cases from there.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.480
So that is more on the runtime side.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.040
And when you do something like DevOps,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.440
that will be, okay, these tests together form my smoke test today.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.640
And then these tests are going to be my functional test

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.960
when I go into the staging environment,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.290
stuff like that.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.210
I like that. That makes sense.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.050
So one thing I want to ask is the theme

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.490
of the role of test design for successful automation.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.810
I think there would probably be, if I were to ask 10 people,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.770
I get 11 different answers on what successful test automation was.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.170
So what does successful test automation mean to you?

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.630
Yeah, I agree that I can spend the rest of the hour

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.670
with giving definitions.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.670
But for me, it mostly means manageable and maintainable.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.430
So after a year, you should still understand

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.310
what test you actually have,

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.150
that should not have run out of control,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.590
which is fairly frequent the case.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.190
And most of all, if you hit the button,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.520
the test should work.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.160
And that even becomes more important now with DevOps.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.480
If you really want to do something

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.320
like continuous integration, let alone continuous deployment,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.840
your test need to run.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.240
And if the test break halfway because of a timing problem

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.240
or the interface element it can't find,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.230
then that spoils the show.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.070
Actually, I really like that answer.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.870
I think if you were to ask a lot of people new

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.430
to test automation, they may, that question about success,

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.870
they would talk about coverage or,

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.630
actually, they would talk about coverage a lot.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:36.520
And I like the idea of realizing that tests

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.280
should be able to live for a long time

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.280
and be trustworthy, be debuggable, be a solid foundation,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.520
as much of a solid foundation of the product

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.720
as the product is itself.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.120
So I think it's really cool you have that thought

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.910
about what success means.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.230
I think actually on this one,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.110
particularly when he talks about the DevOps world.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.590
So he's talking about services type world.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.950
Maintainability is absolutely critical.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.750
As I've mentioned on the show,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.750
in X-Bing when I was, yes, that's right.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.690
We've said this before,

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.790
that's for you on the Slack channel.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.900
In Bing, any dev can deploy something within 15 minutes.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.620
And having, and they do it independently.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.230
A maintenance of test cases is critical

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.510
in that environment.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.980
You have to have your test suite

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.460
be as adaptable as the product code.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.540
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.060
So cool.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.900
There's one other thing,

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.820
actually a couple of things I wanted to talk to you about.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.680
One is I did my homework,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.840
I read through your abstracts

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.840
for your upcoming Star East talks.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.560
And I don't know if the A-B testing promo code still works,

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.800
but I'll throw it out there now in the middle here.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.640
But you mentioned specifically action-based testing,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.600
behavior-driven development, and exploratory testing.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.180
So as far as our listeners go,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.680
behavior-driven development, they know what it is.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.240
Exploratory testing, they know what it is.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.360
I think action-based testing still isn't

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.600
as well of a known term.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600
I did read up on it, so I could talk about it,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.440
but I think maybe referring to you

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.240
to talk through what action-based testing is

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.760
and what it does for you would be a better way to do it.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.440
Well, thanks for asking.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.920
It is based on two principles.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.240
One, it's keyword-driven.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.760
So when you write a test,

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.400
you write it as a sequence of actions.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.040
That's where the name comes from.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.080
And each action consists of an action keyword

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.480
with zero or more arguments.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.160
And you try to write these tests,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.360
especially when at the business level,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.360
in a way that a non-technical person

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.950
can easily understand what is being tested.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.070
And then the second concept that we just talked about

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.830
is the modular design.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.950
So that combination of the actions and the keywords

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.750
and the modules, that is kind of the core

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.390
of action-based testing.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.870
And by the way, it was interesting

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.990
that you mentioned BDD,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.630
behavior-driven development.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.630
It is very straightforward to make a conversion

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.310
between BDD scenarios, language scenarios,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.510
and actions and keywords.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.710
And you can also go back,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.390
you can go from keywords back to scenarios.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.950
I actually made a tool for that,

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.790
made it myself just as an exercise,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.470
but that makes those conversions.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.630
So if any of the listeners is interested in that,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.150
they can just contact me,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.510
and I'm happy to share that tool with them.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.070
But the reason I made the tool

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.830
is not just for convenience,

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.390
but just to kind of investigate and show

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.790
that a test based on actions

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.910
and a test based on BDD,

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.710
that they are kind of conceptually equivalent.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.390
It is very much the same way of thinking.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.810
That kind of makes sense.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.370
I never made that connection before,

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:37.850
but given when then, does line up with keyword testing.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.450
Yeah, and also the sentences themselves.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.450
And when you do in the BDD scenario,

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.090
it's basically a couple of sentences,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.210
phrases I think the word is,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.770
that those can be predefined.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.770
And if I bought 10 sweaters,

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.690
and then you can predefined a phrase called,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.570
I bought X, Y, and then X is the number,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.690
and Y is the product.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.090
And then you can create automation behind it

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.730
to exercise that particular sentence.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.290
So very easy to convert that sentence into,

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.090
buy sweaters 10,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.570
that's like an action line.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.130
And then all you have to do is automate that action.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.770
And when you look at it,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.770
the organizing in that way makes it more manageable.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.690
Actions are much easier to manage

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:33.970
and to automate and sentences.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.000
At least that's what I think.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.480
Is, so many of our listeners are,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.840
as Alan pointed out,

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.200
are fans of BDD and TDD.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.200
Is that what you would advise our audience

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.800
around the difference between,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.920
say open source tools like Cucumber and others

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.300
that enable BDD automation versus an ABT strategy?

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.260
I would personally,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.860
I would want to work with the keywords.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.700
It's more efficient, simpler,

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.380
the sentences,

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.180
it has a tendency to kind of get out of control

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.020
and multiple people.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.620
And let's say you have a project team

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.380
with many, many people,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.500
different people that come up with different sentences.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.900
And to paraphrase you,

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.980
if you have 10 people creating tests

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.300
and coming up with a sentence for buying sweaters,

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.060
there will be 11 sentences saying the same thing.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.820
It's very difficult to standardize language.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.020
While keywords,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.780
and they're almost like function calls,

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.220
that's fairly easy to organize

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.220
and to define and to agree on in a team.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.540
And then because of that tool,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.180
you can easily translate from one to the other.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.380
And doesn't even matter what keyword tool you use,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.300
and that's a fairly straightforward conversion.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.900
So I would personally,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.260
if I have to do a big testing project,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.380
I would try to write the test

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.460
and organize the test as keywords

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.780
when I have to present it to somebody

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.140
who is not part of the team,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.490
then I might translate it into the sentences.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.810
One of the things that Alan,

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.280
I don't know if you know,

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.280
back in the day,

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:39.140
so I did play my hand in ABT.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.340
And one of the things that I found that's really nice

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.760
is it often directly ports into code.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.460
And so one of the benefits that I've discovered

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.260
is when people go read my code,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
they're not reading Devs,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.340
they're not having to follow pointers, right?

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.660
The methods and the objects used

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.300
read so very similar to the same test cases

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.140
that I may have designed in my test architecture doc.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.900
Yeah, that is true.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.500
In fact, you're doing testing and automation,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.140
it is very close to development.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:26.140
And you see that developers feel very at home

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.020
with the actions

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.740
because they see it as function calls.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.500
And even if you don't want to use a keyword tool

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.460
and like our own tool,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.380
you could just put it in a source file

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.460
and just make function calls out of it.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.980
I think you would achieve more or less the same result.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.220
And I do not believe that you have to go

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.060
to natural language sentences to develop the test.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:56.500
And that's more like to create a negative to share.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.180
It's a bit like COBOL

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.580
and the programming language with COBOL

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.900
many years ago came to the market.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.980
That was even well before my time.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.380
The idea was that you would use natural language, English,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.140
to create your software.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.140
And that it would make it easier to create software.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.060
Well, history has started otherwise.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.980
And the more successful language now we see C++ and Java,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.840
which does not look like natural language at all.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.220
Well, so speaking up as a representative

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.820
of the up and coming data science community,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.140
I'm gonna state that I think COBOL was probably a good idea

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.680
but its time was too early.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.680
I do think the advances of natural language programming,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.960
I think we're gonna see programming

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.160
through natural language within our lifetime

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.840
in a way that actually works.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.800
Yeah, I would say you probably want to wait

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.150
until it actually works.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.070
And you can't do more of that.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.690
Kind of like with self-driving cars, right?

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.530
Yes.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.920
So love the idea of using action-based testing

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.280
for functional testing, behavioral testing.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.120
Do you use it for other kinds of testing

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.320
or are there kinds of testing

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.760
where action-based testing isn't appropriate?

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.240
Well, I think it works.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.920
But the way I always say it,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.640
it works for every test that you write down.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.160
So there is a very important category of test called

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.800
exploratory testing.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.840
Most of the listeners will probably be familiar with that.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.440
And people like Cam Kamer, James Bach, Michael Bolton.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.480
That's a different animal.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.600
You really interact with the system under test

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.000
basically from a human manual perspective,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.040
usually manual perspective.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.640
And you kind of try to learn about the system under test.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.640
So you search your way through the system under test

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.120
and you learn and at the same time,

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.800
you're going to spot problems.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.000
You're going to see, hey, the color of the logo is wrong.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.600
The logo is missing.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.640
There might be things that you spot

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.560
that you did not expect to go wrong.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.120
So you did not make a test case for them,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.130
but still it can be very important items.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.930
So that kind of testing,

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.450
that's generally not something you will do

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.650
with an action-based model.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.010
That does not mean that action-based test

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.290
could not be exploratory design.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:49.850
When you create and test for a business process,

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.410
nothing stops you from maybe either talk

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.210
to the business people, the end users,

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.170
try to understand that business process.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.490
And in that process of understanding,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.730
you get ideas for tests.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.650
And rather than just follow the steps in the UI.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.240
So that there is some similarity there.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.120
And I agree completely, yeah.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.400
On the other hand, if you have tests like non-UI tests

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.240
and like embedded software or services,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.360
maybe with micro-services, anything like that,

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.000
that can be done very, very well with action-based testing.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Action-based testing is even better in non-UI

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.800
than it is in UI-based tests.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.640
So for that, it works well.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.020
I would probably even think

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.900
that it could be used for unit testing,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.660
but I don't see that happening a lot.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.980
Most unit testing is just done by developers

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.620
directly when they create the software.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.820
And then especially in agile,

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.420
you tend to make the test first

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.980
and then the function on the test.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.980
And I don't see that really doing with keywords or actions.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.940
So that middle area between the pure unit test on one hand

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.220
and like the exploratory testing on the other hand,

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.220
that entire area in between,

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.920
the action-based testing works very well.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.800
What about things like load, stress, and perf testing?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.160
Could you find applications for action-based testing there?

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.520
And one of the very first action-based projects I did,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.120
I was still in the Netherlands,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.000
and you guys didn't mention it,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.720
I am from the Netherlands.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.040
That was for the European Stock Exchange.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.040
And there we did a test with 40 laptops

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.080
just to emulate the trading process.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.120
And so that goes very well with actions.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.240
You just make the scenarios with actions

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.760
and then you use more actions

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.320
to kind of populate the machines

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.040
and get them started and get the results.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.080
So there might be actions like generate load

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.080
and there might be an action like check response time

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.720
and with a value of let's say 10,

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.040
meaning if it is not there within 10 seconds, it fails.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.540
So that basically goes very well.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.540
All right, that's good to know.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.740
I wasn't thinking about that.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.740
That's good information.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.500
I think one last question,

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.340
then we'll give you a chance

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.780
to tell us what we should have asked you.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.940
I have a saying I've used for a long time

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.940
around test design that says,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.100
and this actually goes back to a minute ago,

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.460
you're talking about the difference,

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.940
like that spectrum of exploratory testing

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.860
versus what should be automated.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.500
And a line I've used for several years is

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.340
that you should automate 100% of the tests

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.760
that should be automated.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.040
So I'm curious what sort of,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.520
and that's the test design challenge

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.240
or a big part of the test design challenge

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.720
is that heuristic of what sorts of testing

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.040
should I automate versus what should I not try

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.280
cause I'm not gonna get a good return on my investment.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.240
So what sort of heuristics you use

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.800
to figure out what should be automated

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.720
or how do you figure out like

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.920
what do you wanna automate versus maybe

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.280
what you would encourage clients

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.200
or yourself to not automate?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.400
Yeah, that's one of my favorite questions.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.600
I always hope that people will ask.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.600
Essentially the answer is very simple.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.680
I automate everything.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.520
That means I will automate every test that I write down.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.280
And so exploratory testing is a bit of an exception there.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.120
But if I write a test down,

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.000
even on the back of an envelope,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.200
I will typically automate it

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.440
unless it's really a one-time test.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.640
And like in this particular conversation,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.760
make sure the audio works.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.680
Once it works, we do the podcast and that's it.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.920
So we don't have to automate that test.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.640
With you guys, this is podcast number 57

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.560
and you wanna make it up to at least 100.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.600
So maybe you want to kind of automate some of those tests

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.440
because it's very minimal.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.920
Now I have a second point to make there

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.720
and the question for me is not

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.800
whether I should automate the test.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.160
The question for me is whether I should have that test,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.240
whether I should develop the test.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.560
So it is not the ROI on automation

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.800
that counts for me,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.200
it's the ROI on testing that counts for me.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.480
And in the module approach,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.840
that's what I emphasize.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.880
Make a list of modules.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.560
And like in the ideal world,

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.040
all the modules that you could possibly make,

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.360
then be selective about the ones

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.120
that you actually develop.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.080
Once you develop them,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.760
because you develop them with actions,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.360
with reusable keywords,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.640
it's almost hard not to automate them,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.640
to just automate them.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.280
Does that make sense?

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.560
It does.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.440
Can you go a little bit deeper in terms of

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.880
how you advise people to proactively evaluate

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.230
the ROI of the test?

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.630
Yes, absolutely.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.030
First of all, spend some time on it.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.550
That's the same with test design in general,

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.550
just by thinking about it,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.990
how do I organize the test?

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.790
What am I going to test?

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.390
What is really a priority to test?

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.190
You already get large, very good results.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.310
It helps enormously later on in the automation.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.110
Now, in the approach that I follow,

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.030
it's almost like writing a book.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.390
When you write a book,

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.390
the most difficult part of the book

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.110
is the table of contents.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.590
That's what you have to really think about.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.750
And then once you have that table of contents,

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.590
now writing the rest of the book is,

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.950
of course, a lot more work.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.670
But assuming that you know what you're talking about,

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.390
it's doable.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.510
It's just straightforward doing.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.190
It is that table of contents

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.870
that you really have to sweat about it to think about.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.110
How am I going to organize my stuff?

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.190
So the way I look at test design is very similar.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.870
You start with a high level test design phase

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.190
in which you try to figure out

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.670
what kind of tests am I going to make?

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.270
What am I going to need?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.670
That results in a list of test modules

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.040
in my terminology.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.360
And then you can make,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.920
put them in a spreadsheet, for example,

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.880
make a column priority.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.320
Which one do I do first?

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.240
Which one do I do last?

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.120
Which one am I not going to do?

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.800
Then you can,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.640
once you do that,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.830
then you can start developing those test modules.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.350
And there are always a couple that are very urgent.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.150
And there are always many that you

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.120
don't care about that much.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.880
Oh, and another point there,

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.560
is that's also the moment that you can go to

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.560
managers or product owners or domain experts,

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.480
developers, that you can start cooperating.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.400
For example, in the realm of Sprint or anywhere else,

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.160
that you can discuss what are we going to do?

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.560
And what do we need to do?

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.720
What test do we need to develop?

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.480
And when do we need to?

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.190
So that kind of considerations.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.350
So one of the things,

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.630
I have a few questions.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.390
One of the things we,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.230
our listeners,

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:34.430
one of the things that attracts people to our podcast

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.430
is we've talked about a concept

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.130
that I frame as sort of modern testing.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.090
And one of the things that I refer to this is

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.450
that in the last 20 years,

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.370
some big changes have occurred, right?

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.810
We've seen in several companies,

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:59.010
the individual test role disappearing.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.450
I work for Microsoft,

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.250
that's certainly something that has happened here.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:09.250
We've seen different agile philosophies move forward

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.210
and multiple different successes

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.130
in terms of companies producing product

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.330
using those paradigms.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.650
And then even now we see a big push

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.410
towards services and the cloud.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:30.070
What do you view as modern testing?

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.150
What are the big changes

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.750
that you've observed in your career?

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.350
And what do you think is coming next?

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.280
That's a broad question.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.250
I will try to answer as best as I can.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.490
I've seen several things change.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.850
Many of those in a meaningful way

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.010
and maybe some others not so meaningful way.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.930
Let me start with the last one.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.050
I see testing as a profession.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.770
I believe there is such a thing as a good tester,

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.250
somebody who can find problems,

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:09.170
who can try unexpected situations and find bugs that way.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:13.770
Because most of the bugs are not so much coding bugs

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.210
in my terminology,

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.810
it's not so much like I specified it

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.930
and the developer didn't build it,

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.970
but the developer specified it himself,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:25.050
but he forgot the minus sign or something.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:28.850
Those had bugs happen that are usually quite easy to find

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.050
and it's not such a common problem.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.050
The most of the bugs, the things that we call bugs,

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.730
is you're not meeting an unexpected situation.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.770
Something happened, some input values happened

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.490
that you didn't expect

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.530
or you wrote something to the database that was wrong

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.810
and another module gets into trouble because of it.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.810
So unexpected situation.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:56.450
To deal with that, testing can be very helpful.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.210
And I believe that is a profession.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.490
I don't believe a good developer

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.970
is automatically a good tester.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.450
It is like, and I try to explain it,

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.730
I sometimes compare it with an airplane.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.370
If you are a good C++ developer

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:16.010
who develops a control system for an airplane,

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.000
it does not mean you're a good pilot.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.600
If you really think you are,

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.240
let me know which flight you're piloting,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.750
I will take another flight.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.990
So it is really a profession.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.470
And just like automation is also a profession,

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.350
a good programmer is not necessarily

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.150
a good automation engineer.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:42.990
It has, automation is a very specific craft.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:47.070
You have to deal with timing and identification of objects

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.990
and scheme flows.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:53.990
And it's a very interesting profession to have.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.930
Another thing that I've seen changed during my lifetime

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:03.370
and that change is continuing is the role of automation.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:08.290
When I started, automation was a yes, no question.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.490
What should I automate?

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:16.580
And you even asked that question earlier on in this program.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.580
But you see a shift in agile and in DevOps.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.980
Automation is not a question mark.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.460
Everything is done with automation

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.860
because in DevOps you're essentially

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.780
automating the entire integration and deployment process,

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.660
including provisioning test machines

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.060
and running tests on them.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.660
So automation is not really a question anymore.

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.100
Every project will have automation now.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.470
I completely agree.

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:54.600
Automation in that context, though, becomes a bit different.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.520
You're saying production code has to perform an action

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.480
and then it has to validate it in near real time.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:08.310
So in that case, what do you advise

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.910
given your guidance around testing as a craft

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.670
and Dev as a craft?

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:19.670
And I know several DevOps folks who will adamantly tell you

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.830
that DevOps is also its own craft.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.950
What's your guidance?

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.350
I think they're all right.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.470
I think that DevOps is a craft

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.830
and especially the opposite side.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.590
Ops is also a craft, obligations.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.190
Planning, production, planning, testing,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.470
planning environments, which can be very different

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.390
for different companies, for different organizations,

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.790
what that actually means.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.390
But it is a craft.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.510
It is a different way of thinking

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:59.510
than making if statements in a function.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.670
That is, it's all craft.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.360
And one of the very positive things

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.600
that currently is happening is that you cooperate.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.720
So your foreign teams and those teams cooperate.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.200
That means that the developers, the business owners

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.320
and the testers are in the same team.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.640
And you get the best test and the best results

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.640
when you are in the same team.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.400
Because then you can talk to the developers

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.120
about making the system testable,

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.120
make sure that there are hooks for timing,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.760
for data that you want to display, et cetera.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.840
You can work with business owners for the functionality.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.680
You can, those business owners can bring you

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.040
to the domain experts and other stakeholders like auditors.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.400
And so that cooperation can lead to very good results,

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.840
especially if all the team members know their craft

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.960
and just saying, oh, let's use this mission to test this,

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.600
let developers do the tests because developers are so smart

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.560
that they can do that testing thing as well.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.360
I don't think that's gonna work very well.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.280
I think I wouldn't like to do it that way.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.560
And we're not doing that with our own brother.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.360
And I think it almost never applies.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.620
So I'm looking at the clock.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.980
We're running out of time.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.340
I think we have time for one more question now.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.360
So DevOps, you brought that up.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:39.220
I'm curious now, what's your sense or your guidance

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.290
on the role of testing in production?

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.600
What does that mean?

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:52.120
Yeah, I'd say testing in production is a very cool concept

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.560
in which you actually just bring the systems to production

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.040
and you will do something like A-B testing,

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.440
not you, Allen and Brent testing, but A-B testing.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.600
There is officially no other important version

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.520
of A-B testing.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.360
Okay.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.040
And then maybe I stop answering this question.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.800
No, no, please do.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.720
So yes, A-B testing in testing and production.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.240
So what's your sense?

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:26.240
That's probably just like how you organize your revenue string

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.240
and the money coming in, part of it goes to A

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.440
and part of it goes to B.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.280
And so that's the same you do with A-B testing

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.120
on the production environment.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.720
And you typically take a certain slice of users,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.720
let's say, Iowa, and then all the users from Iowa

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.400
get the, all the traffic from Iowa goes through

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.840
a new version of a module of a component,

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.640
in the term of a component.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.760
And then you see if it works.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.920
And then if it doesn't work,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.400
you roll it back as quickly as possible.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.920
Now it's fail fast and you go back to the old component.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.440
If it does work, you switch everybody else

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.840
to the new component as well.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.280
So rather than releasing an entire system at once,

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.910
you release it component by component by component.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.390
So that's very meaningful.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.070
Now, one of the things you can do with automation

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.350
and with test design is that that B component

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.310
could actually just be the test modules.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:38.350
So rather than put Iowa at stake

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.830
and let them go through the B channel,

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:45.750
you just let your automated test go for the B channel.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.390
And if it doesn't work,

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.030
then you don't put that particular component

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.710
into production.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.230
And now all of this is very different

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.110
for whatever company you work for

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:00.430
and whatever project and whatever system you talk about.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:04.350
And therefore you need to really follow

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:07.190
what I call a business or reenter the approach.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:10.390
You really need to look at what does my system do

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.150
and how often do I need to upgrade it.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.790
A continuous deployment is not a must have,

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.430
it is a nice to have.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.830
And many systems do not have to be continuously

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.830
be released and continuously be deployed.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:29.600
It really depends on what the purpose of that system is.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.030
Does that answer your question?

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.870
Yes, it does.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:34.550
Thank you very much.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:38.390
So Hans, I did mention that you will be at Star East

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.510
coming up, gosh, is that like two weeks from now?

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.750
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:43.590
Coming right up.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.990
By the time I happen, it happens I hope to know.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:48.950
Yeah, great.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.230
Is there anything else coming up

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.070
or anything coming out you want to plug?

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.150
Yeah, let's see.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.110
I'm also gonna talk at Star West

00:40:56.110 --> 00:41:00.470
with those of you who don't wanna come to Orlando

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.190
and you can come to Anaheim.

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.430
We have Disney events in both of them.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:10.130
And if just point out if you wait, A.B. Testers,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.890
if you wait on your registration,

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:14.090
we will have a discount coming up

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.890
for Star West registration.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:21.890
And maybe another thing is I keep all my articles

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:25.770
on a webpage which is called Happy Tester.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:29.170
And opposite of a sad tester, Happy Tester.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.010
So if you wanna read anything I'm talking about,

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.710
please go to that page.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:36.430
You mentioned earlier Hans,

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.790
that if folks wanted to reach out to you on ABT,

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:42.110
they can.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.400
How would you like them to do that?

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.280
Well, as you probably know,

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.700
I work for a company called V

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.700
so if they just do a Hans at V

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.400
then they will reach me.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.880
I will always answer your emails.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.900
Don't worry about it.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.460
V

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.380
Right, I'll put that in the show notes as well.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.540
I'll obfuscate it enough to keep the scrapers

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.460
from sending you spam,

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.380
but I will put that in the show notes

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.080
along with everything else.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.100
So one thing I wanna mention to everyone

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.880
listening to the show is,

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.640
other than the specific question

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.960
about action-based testing,

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.360
the rest of the questions you answered,

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.840
you had great deep and well thought out answers for

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.280
were all general things about test automation.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.920
And I think anyone in testing today

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.800
should be able to answer those questions

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.240
at some level of depth.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.440
That was one thing that really,

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.800
they made a point that kinda came to me

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.320
as you were talking today,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.520
was that although we were asking you about

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.600
mostly sort of kinda general level,

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.440
could be an interview somewhere,

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.080
but you obviously your experience shines through.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.220
You have deep answers for all these things

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.400
and a lot of experience and it was fun to hear that.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.470
So thank you.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.750
Yeah, sometimes I allow people to disagree with me.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.790
It's hard to believe, but sometimes I do.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.870
And the point is not that you need to agree

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.950
with everything I say when you're in a project.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.130
The point is that you think about it,

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.410
that you make some considerations about testing,

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:21.410
not just, oh, it's a side product of the development.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.490
Now make it an item,

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.330
make it something that you think about

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:30.330
when you go into a development cycle

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:33.050
and that will pay back big time.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.640
I can promise you that.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.800
All right, well, thank you very much.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.400
Everybody, this is Alan.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.240
This is Brent.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.640
And we'll see you next time on A B testing.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.220
Thank you, Hans.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.060
Thank you.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.900
Thanks for having me.
