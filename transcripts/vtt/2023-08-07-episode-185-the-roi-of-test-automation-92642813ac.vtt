00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Well, I don't know. I don't know your view. Have you heard of a band called The Beatles?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:17.180
Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.860
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.580
leadership, Agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now, on with the show. Welcome back to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.300
the AB Testing Podcast. Thank you. Hey, man. How's it going? Good. Good. Here we go again. You know,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.540
this is not a secret, but I'm going to let the first time listeners know that we are not one of

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:57.220
those podcasts, the carefully scripted script, carefully written script that we use to wow you

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.020
with our ability to go deep into the topics that matter. That's not us.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:11.360
No, the days that we accidentally wow you, that was entirely unscripted.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.920
Yeah. And what we do, as they say, even a broken clock is right two times a day.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.800
Correct. Unless it's a 24 hour clock, but they get the point. They get the point.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.560
I was talking with someone about the podcast and I think I speak for you, like why we do it. Do we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.680
do it for fame? No. Do we do it to piss people off? Actually, no. You think so, but maybe no.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.120
This is, and the person I was talking to understood this perfectly, but I don't want to put words in

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:52.240
your mouth, but this podcast is for me, as well as my Saturday blog posts, both are forms of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.560
therapy for me. You know, with my, my regular therapist, I talk through what's going on and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.880
what I'm struggling with, but more personal inward stuff for things about relationships

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.160
with the people around me. But you and I talk about oftentimes it's, I'm talking through things

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.160
that I'm thinking about that I haven't really figured out yet. And it's, or things I want to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.880
talk about, but haven't found anyone to talk about with. You can always talk about any random prep

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.360
with uncle Brent. Yeah. Cause uncle Brent, it really is. He's not really all there. So we just

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.400
talk, but you know, we got a lot of, I'm going to talk about two things, two forms of therapy.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.440
Sometimes we do a podcast. I know this is your feeling. Someone listens to a podcast and goes,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.040
what the hell did I just listen to? Sometimes I finished recording a podcast and I go, what

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.000
the hell did Brett and I just do? But those two aren't necessarily correlated. And sometimes we

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.280
can do a crap podcast from my point of view. And a bunch of people go, Ooh, that was good.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.080
Thank you for that episode, Alan and Brent. And I just shrugged my shoulders and stare at the sky

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.760
and say, you're welcome. Really? Those drive me crazy, but it's maybe what did you like about

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.400
that? What, what could you have liked? No, it's the, um, in the same thing happened with,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.000
with blogging, right? The ones with, I sat down and I was careful and I spent eight hours writing

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.360
up and judging every single word. Those are the ones where not even crickets, uh, give me feedback,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.760
but the ones that I just sit down and barf out. Oh, that's fantastic.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.280
Well, my deal is that's, I'm glad you brought that up. Cause I only barf out. I write a,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.240
for now 34 weeks or so in a row, I counted. I have written a blog post every weekend,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.120
mostly on Saturday, sometimes on Sunday. I do not know what I'm going to write about

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.830
when I sit down to write. I just pick something. I have a couple of things that kind of sit in the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.670
drafts folder. Like if I, like this week, I had an idea of something I've already forgot when it

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.630
was. I wrote a little blurb in a draft post it's sitting there, but most of the time I'll

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.910
just sit down and I'll start. And last week I wrote about, um, how tech interviews are

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.150
horrible at most places. I got just a massive amount of feedback on that and then tags and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.190
all kinds of things. So it's weird. Of course, if I talk about how dedicated testers may not be

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.430
needed, a whole different crowd reaches out and drives my numbers up. Or for the most part,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.230
I'm just writing about stuff I'm thinking about. I'm not trying to make a,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.990
a change in the industry or make some big thing go on. I just want to dump my thoughts before I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.790
forget what I'm thinking because I'm old and that happens.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.470
At least get it in the to-do list. If there's anything that you need to follow up on,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.870
I get that. Yeah. So anyway, that's a really back in. That's what we're doing with the podcast.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.990
We're going to talk today about stuff that I have dumped into our shared Slack channel.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.950
If you want to be in the same, uh, hang out with Brent and I and I'll almost a thousand others,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.870
including Patrick Pearl, test Pappy, who listened to our last episode and gave us some good feedback

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.670
and comments. You can go to modern testing.org and click the link to join the one of the three dot

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.950
slack.com. We had probably half a dozen people join just this week alone. So good little trickle

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:21.790
coming in. The countdown to 1000 is steadily getting closer. I'm not sure what happens when

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.540
we get a thousand users, but we have a little party, but we're at 916 now. I don't know

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:36.420
what that means. So I know. Is it, is it, it's 91.6% of the way to 1000. We could round up. I mean,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.380
I mean, I'm fine with that. I mean, we've, we've already, we've already rounded up

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.540
significantly with, with the three. What's what's what's a thousand. All right. Do we,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.820
we have talked already since I went to Taylor Swift, right? Did we,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.580
did we talk about that? No, actually you were going to. Oh, that's right. And I said,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.510
if I didn't come back, you know what happened? I went to Taylor Swift. Not only was it good,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.510
and I have been to at least a hundred concerts in my life. It very likely is the best concert I

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:15.790
ever went to. Really? Really. I do hear that, that she does put on the show. Did she bring out a

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.710
guest? No, no. But I am, you know, I've seen, I've seen Bruce Springsteen play for three and

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.150
a half hours. And some of the time he's phoning it in a little bit. I mean, he's a great performer.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.550
I've seen him three or four times. I have been to a lot of, I've seen the Rolling Stones play

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.190
three hours. I've seen a lot of groups play long shows, but watching her so happy to perform

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.310
the same songs she's been doing for all year, two or three shows every weekend and love

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.990
performing them so much and performing them so well. And just, it was very, very good. Very

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.190
good. So that was good. And I survived this weekend to see fair. So once again, another weekend to

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.110
stay out of Seattle. Seafair for those not from Seattle. This is the weekend when big loud boats

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:07.630
race on the lake, big loud planes fly in the sky. And a bunch of people sit on boats,

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.390
sit on the beach and get really drunk while all it's going on. Did I sum up seafare?

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.830
Yeah. Didn't miss anything. No. All right. Do you want to talk? Do you have anything to share

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.470
with the crowd before we get into a topic or two? I'm actually pretty excited to find out that

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.200
seafares this weekend. I didn't realize that. Brent, you say, so just for listeners at home,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.440
Brent is already very quiet. I'm going to try and fix that in post-broad. But then when you talk

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.280
softly at your mic levels, you just get cut off completely. And I'm going to add words in there.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.840
I'm going to do one of those things where it's Brent's voice saying, hello, I like doggies and

00:07:50.850 --> 00:08:00.130
puppies than flowers. Yeah. With olive oil and garlic. No, that's number one. It's very exciting

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:08.770
to see that. I don't think my daughter's ever been there. I may brave Seattle.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.850
All right. Do you want to talk about stuff people care about?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.450
Sure. We're coming up on that 10 minute mark. But once I edit a little out and then add a little

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.290
intro music right at the 10 minute mark where people like to skip forward to, like I have a lot

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:25.970
of podcasts, by the way, I'm going to screw it up now, where I use Pocket Cast and it allows me

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:32.050
to start a podcast like 30 seconds in, a minute in. And I think if you have Pocket Cast and you

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:37.730
listen to AB testing, just set it to start 10 minutes in. That's like a productivity hack.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:47.010
Hey, by the way, there is a podcast that I discovered accidentally this last week.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.210
All right. Is it DrumGagel?

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.580
No. No. It reminds me of you. I don't know why. I don't know why.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.460
Please be someone smart. Please be someone smart. Please be someone smart.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.780
The name of the podcast is called 60 songs that explained the 90s.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.070
Oh, I don't know this podcast, but it sounds good.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:18.990
But and he'll pick a song and it's an hour and a half and he spends the first half hour off of

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:26.430
it's just some random tangent. And then he segues into the song and then he has a guest. Like right

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:33.150
now, the one I'm listening to is smells like teen spirit. And he managed to land Courtney Love as

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:42.750
a guest. Oh my God. It is fascinating. Yeah. I I've gone through like several of the songs and I'm a huge

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:49.870
band of, uh, do you know the band? They might be giants. Uh, yeah. I do know the band. They might

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.590
be giants. I'm not like, like, do you think I went to live on the moon during the 90s? Like,

00:09:54.590 --> 00:10:00.830
what do you think? Well, I don't know. I don't know your view. Have you heard of a band called

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.830
the Beatles? They okay. That's that's a bit of an exaggeration. But okay. Hey,

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.630
Brent, have you heard of this one band? They're really cool. They're called Van Halen. I have.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:20.110
All right. Anyway, go on. I have all of their albums. Now. So so a bunch of a bunch of my

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:28.860
like he's actually claiming that smells like teen spirit actually killed 80s pop.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:35.700
Like we would have still gone on with 80s pop if it hadn't been for that song. That's his argument.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:42.580
I'm like, okay, that's a fascinating topic. It is. But let me okay. Screw the 10 minute thing.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.100
I'm sorry. I'm going to tell you my story. So, you know, I was in my twenties and the

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:54.500
nineties and listening to music and I was not listening to any 80s pop. I mean, I was into

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.940
80s pop. Certainly I know I could I can play song quiz on Alexa on 80s and get 100% till

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:08.610
the cows come home. But there were a lot of bands that were nowhere near 80s pop before.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:16.110
Nevermind came out. And I remember I went to Silver Platters in must have been fall of 90.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:22.850
I don't know what it's 92 year was that I was on my way to go teach a marching band and I

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:29.090
wanted some music for the road. So I grabbed the brand new albums from Pearl Jam and Nirvana on the

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:36.020
same day and listened to them. I also like the Pearl Jam still today better, but they're both like,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.860
but they weren't like they're oh my God, this is so different. This is the brand new thing.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.300
I didn't I don't remember feeling that way at all. It was maybe it's because of the

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.810
sea. I was in the Seattle crowd listening to a lot of those bands and seeing all those

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:54.610
bands live. But I did not feel in any way like I was listening to some brand new thing that was

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.890
going to be the hit that it was. It was just it was just more of the same I had heard,

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:07.170
but done and produced very well. Do you remember? Do you remember? Do you remember any song

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:15.410
from winger or striper or even poison after I remember I remember after this.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.610
Yeah, because a lot of those came out some of that came out before then there was that big

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:27.810
thing on glam rock. There was warrant and striper and all those bands before then for sure.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:34.370
But even going back 10 years before then, I mean, the 80s had Motley crew and

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:42.670
bands like that. So that sort of glam rock, I think more of David Bowie, but that glam metal

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:48.430
had been around for 10 years before Pearl Jam and Nirvana. So yeah, I remember those

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:57.310
bands, but they're different because those bands sucked. Yeah, the difference for me was when those

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.870
when those songs came out for the first time in MTV, I was right there with you. I'm like,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:10.510
people buy this. Oh, my God. Yeah, I mean, it was horrible. So anyway, we should get no,

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.710
no, no, no, we're going to go to the music a little bit longer. I'm going to actually explain

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.990
myself with the Taylor Swift. Okay. I was thinking, oh, Taylor Swift, she's just so popular.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:26.430
So I am there. I mean, above everything else. And my interest in music is very much on the lyrics.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.030
I love the singer songwriters. That's why I've seen Bruce Springsteen a bunch of times.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.910
That's why I'm a big fan of like John Prine and Dylan, the people that can tell a story in their

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:40.270
songs. And that's a big reason why I like listening to Taylor Swift, not her pop stuff. I really

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.190
don't like like the reputation set. I was it was actually performed well, although I was going to

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:50.110
go take a bathroom break. But she, man, I mean, she knows how to tell a story with a song. So that's

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.710
flat out it. Even Pearl Jam, Pearl Jam, especially, you know, how to tell a story with a song. They're

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:01.950
not they're not like a not comparing Pearl Jam to Bob Dylan by any means. But if you listen to like

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:08.030
Jeremy, the lyrics have some substance warrant by the way, warrant by the poison. There's no

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:15.630
substance of the songs. It's just it's just crap. The words don't even matter. Courtney Love on the

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:23.550
podcast said that she loves Jeremy more than any song Kurt ever did. Well, you get the point. I

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:28.350
want the music I love has meaning. I was listening to Elliot Smith last week in the shower a little

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.190
while ago today. So I don't know one of my favorites from the 90s, so much, you know,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.790
much mellower, very depressed version of these lyrics. But anyway, interested. So now that you've

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:42.030
heard five minutes of this, after you skip the first 10 minutes, I'm going to jump us right into

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:52.960
a mailbag question. Holy shit. Oh, what a mailbag question. Okay. Make sure make sure you check out

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:59.520
that podcast. One of our best friends, Percy in the slack group, he said this, Brent, this is

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:05.470
probably a thought exercise more than a mailbag item challenge accepted, but would appreciate

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:11.660
what Alan and Brent think about this. How would you go about calculating the ROI of automated tests?

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.260
I think it's a great question. Let's say in a year, your org is automated and equivalent of 30 years

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:23.470
with a test execution. Would you put a value per test? What is the value with the amount of time

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.670
and material savings instead? What about diminishing return? So I have many, many thoughts on this.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.670
I'm just going to go to I'm going to summarize this whole thing as how do you calculate the ROI

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:40.060
of your automation? How do you know? Like a lot of the poorly written articles about test

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.980
automation say you write this because it saves you so much time in the future and you can focus

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.410
more on other kinds of testing, which may be true. It may not be true, but I have so many thoughts

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.570
to go on that. I'm going to let you start. Brent, how would you go about calculating the ROI

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.340
of automated tests? And for those of you, sorry, sorry, one thing for the people who don't know,

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.700
like ROI, what is this strange abbreviation Alan's using? Seriously? No, it's return on

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:13.660
investment. Go, you're on. Yeah. So for me, for me, right, the return of an automated test

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:21.740
is sort of risk reduction, right? You automate a test. So it validates a part of the product

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:29.020
and you're trying to reduce the risk in a faster amount of calendar time, right? Like the way I

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.580
would interpret ROI of a product, the way I think I would interpret it is number one,

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:45.600
the amount of calendar time saved, times sort of the probability that you would have executed it

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.080
if it had been a manual test case. And I think that's it.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.920
Let me go through the thought exercise part of this because I think that's a confusing answer,

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.840
but it's partially at least correct from my point of view. Maybe there is no correct right or wrong

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:10.240
answer to this question. So Brent, is it possible for me to write an automated test that provides

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:16.400
no value? Yes. Is it possible for me to write an automated test that has

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.600
equal positive value for the entire lifetime of the test?

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:26.290
Equal. So every time you- Is it just as valuable today when I run it as it is a year when I run it?

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.860
I don't agree with that one. No, I don't either. You get the right answer.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:42.380
So the thought exercise here is some tests are more valuable than others. Some automated tests

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:49.100
are more valuable than others. We agree on that. And the value of all automated tests generally

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.700
decreases over time. Well, yes, it generally does.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.140
So why bother? Because there's that period in time,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.900
there's that short period of time where it is valuable.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:10.700
So let me answer this question differently than Percy asked it. Because I love this. And the reason

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:16.540
I love this is I think so many companies, and I'm talking to you listener, but probably not you,

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:21.360
but maybe you, you are running a bunch of automated tests that you've always run

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:29.520
spending hours or days running tests and you're not, you're getting minimal value from that effort.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.300
But Alan, they're automated. They just run. They're free.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:40.700
Let me ask another question. Let's bring in the whole flaky test into the formula.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:47.100
Let's say that test is pretty valuable, but it gives me false positives 20% of the time.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.890
So that makes it less valuable, right? That makes it I get less ROI on that because I'm

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:58.220
spending time maintaining. Right. That one. When I when I think of this whole exercise,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:05.420
I think you were slipped Microsoft when he was hawking this, this approach. I kind of,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:14.910
I kind of view him as as really in spirit, the first data science scientist in test.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.470
Who we talking about?

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.830
That's Jimbo Pfeiffer. Jimbo. Yeah.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.390
There's a name I heard. He's still at Microsoft.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.630
I was just looking that up. I'm not finding this LinkedIn profile.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:31.170
Oh, well, maybe you could have like an address book or something that would let you figure out

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:40.450
if someone still work there. But he had this tool that he built called the Prioritizer.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:46.210
Yep. And I have written versions of that myself. And you you saw where I was going.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.410
Well, that's where I was going. Yeah.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:56.370
To give people context on our main our mind meld here. What we said before was true. Some tests are

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:01.730
more valuable than others. All tests in general lose value over time. While sometimes in their

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.250
length of their time, they may be more valuable than they were in previous times. So what you

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.170
want to do and there's other reasons around flakiness, around length of the test,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:17.090
around how much coverage one particular test gives you that can give you different levels of

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:25.570
value for a single test. So what the way Jimbo and I and others and probably everybody else should

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:32.930
solve this is by prioritizing tests. The way I look at it, for example, is like fast tests.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:39.010
They're going to be more valuable, going to get more away from slower tests if they provide

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:46.930
the same other value. If I have a set of tests, it takes 15 minutes to run. And they're very low

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:51.890
to zero false positives. And they give me good code coverage and they find regressions really

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:57.490
well. Those tests are very valuable when compared to a set of slow tests that are flaky, that

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:05.250
do not find issues. Like for example, how many of you rhetorical question are running that test,

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:11.970
that automated test every day for the last year, because it's automated and you need to run it

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:18.340
every day, even though you haven't found a bug with that test ever. Most people, most people,

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.620
because because we're afraid testers are afraid that the moment they turn off that test,

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:29.580
they'll be your regression and they'll miss it. So the way that I'll just go in a second here. So

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:36.300
the way we did prioritization was you would prioritize and you could eventually you lop off

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.540
the bottom. You don't run tests from one to end in prioritized order. You're from one to a hundred

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:47.660
and skip the rest. If you, when you, if you choose, if the prioritizer chooses to skip running

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:55.340
a test on day one, that test has slightly more value to run on day two. If I skip it on day two,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.780
it has slightly more value on day three and so on. And eventually if you write a good waiting

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.540
system, it will run the right tests at the right time to give you sort of an optimal ROI.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:13.970
Yeah, that, that is just untiming, right? And that is if you as a tester view the code you're

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:20.210
covering as a black box, right? That makes sense. If you view it as a white box, which is what Jim did,

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:26.610
you're like, okay, you know what? That code module that has not changed in the year,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:35.340
as well as the modules that call that code module, they haven't changed. Well,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:43.180
what is the actual risk if we skip that test? Almost zero. Almost zero. But at some point in

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.060
time, it's about getting crap done. So I do want to mention that I've written code coverage

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:56.620
based prioritization as far back as like 2002 or 2003. Just choosing which tests to run based on like,

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:02.060
you look at what, what code changed in the set of check-ins and you run the tests that test that

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:08.220
the challenge for us wasn't an operating system is anytime anything low level changed,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:15.020
like in the IP stack are not so mature prioritization engine said you need to run everything,

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.600
because everything eventually everything goes through the low level stuff, which I guess isn't

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.880
horrible, but not it kind of lose the effect. But yeah, I mean, that, that as a level of

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.760
prioritization based around the code and the code that the tests run, that's been around forever.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.480
Right, right. And this is, this is kind of what I was leading to when I say, okay,

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:45.310
the potential return of the test, like in my view, the point of it has the way you evaluate return

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:52.030
on on investment, the point of a test is to save manual labor. If you whether or not you automate,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.500
right, if you are in a position where you have to run that test pass before we ship, whether

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.540
or not you automate, you're going to run that test pass before we ship. And if you if you don't

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:08.080
have it automated, you're going to do it manually. The whole purpose of the automated tests in that

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:14.960
front is, is essentially to save yourself on that manual time cost to help your team scale.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.160
And that has a very real cost, right? Everybody on your team has a salary and is a very real

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:31.070
cost. So when I, when I try to compare, when I try to compare the value of automated tests versus a

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:38.780
manual test, to me, it's like, okay, the way you can determine what the ROI is, is let's say you

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:44.220
didn't have it automated, which of these things would you have to run manually? And which of

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:51.300
these things would you not the investment of it, of course, there's a one time hit. And then you

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:58.660
have the time, the execution cost. And then as you called out, the additional cost is like flaky

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:05.940
tests, if you have to keep paying that one time cost over and over again, then the amount of risk

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:13.300
that your automation test is validating as stay static. And if the cost goes up, then yeah,

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:18.900
the ROI is going to decrease. So let me throw one more lens on this, as I think about this,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.820
and then we can, we have actually do two mailbags today. If maybe we'll try. No assessment. He

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.820
did a drawing of the test automation pyramid, but turned it upside down and imagined it as a filter.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.980
And basically saying like unit test, the only bugs found here are the bugs that can't be found by

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.060
unit tests. The only bugs found here are the ones that can't be found by integration tests. The only

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.380
bugs that happen at the top of the pyramid at the UI, the ones that can only be found at the

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:52.820
UI automation level. So I would say one way to calculate, I'm just, just again, therapy,

00:25:52.820 --> 00:26:01.060
thinking through this as I talk to calculate the ROI of your automation is for the bugs you're

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:07.870
finding not in automation, is it helping you focus on finding the bugs that can only be found

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:12.510
without automation? Like I wonder if you looked at the bugs your team is finding and being

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:21.470
reported by customers, I would expect a high ROI automation suite to have a lower number of bugs

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:27.230
that you don't think could have been caught with a reasonable automated test. I feel like you

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:32.750
said that sentence with a triple negative. So I'm having a hard time. Okay, let me, let me try this

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:41.420
again. Let me try this again. I wonder if one way to measure ROI is to count the number of

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:50.830
bugs you're finding overall that could not be found with a reasonable automation effort.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:59.760
In other words, when I find a bug, did I just, is that one? Yeah, that's a rough one.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.040
I suppose we could have written automation would be very difficult.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.920
Or are we finding stuff? Yeah, we just didn't write that test. Yep. We didn't write that test.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:15.020
Actually, I'm not sure I like that, but I'm not certain I do either, but it did trigger

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:23.500
an additional thought that we haven't put into our sort of equation. Right. And that is an

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:32.500
automated test. Let's say it's not a flaky test, automated test. And it's, it's, it's finding a bug,

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:41.700
a different bug, maybe once a quarter. What we haven't evaluated is how important that bug is.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:48.340
Yeah. One more thing too, is effort. Go to the bug first. I've been talking about effort after that.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:55.540
Right. So we've talked about it regarding MTP, right? That the data analysis principle,

00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:01.620
the customer principle, if a bug ships in a product that a customer never hits,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.920
we can't do that. Do we care? I don't care. I don't care. And that's maybe the difference.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.800
Going off one of our tangents here, one difference between you and I and a lot of testers, we

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:19.040
care about quality, not testing, which means you and I don't particularly care about bugs

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.560
that no customer has ever found, even if they're in the product. Yeah, actually, literally to get,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.600
to get on my board as a bug. As you know, for years, I haven't had a bug database.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:36.960
To get on my board as a bug, you either have to articulate very succinctly that is absolutely

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:43.280
a bug. The low level engineer wrote a wild true loop. Okay, that's a bug. Right. It's just a

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:50.420
better time before an infinite loop triggers. But without that sort of succinct, I literally

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:56.560
don't care unless there's customer impact. And not even theoretical. Like I want the type of bugs

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.530
that I would fix don't really happen anymore that don't have customer impact. Like, hey,

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:08.770
we accidentally deleted being the customer's entire store. That's a bug. That's a bug, but

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:15.250
that's not going to ship in under my watch. Things like weird things happen if you use a weird

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:20.930
symbol exactly at mid nine on February 29. Yeah, I'm probably going to ship that bug every day,

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:26.210
all day long, I probably not even going to test that condition. So now, I yeah, we're getting

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:33.090
somewhere here. Let me talk about effort too. So, Percy mentioned the equivalent of 30 years

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:38.510
where the test execution. Well, one, what does that mean? But two, but more importantly is

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:45.070
how much effort went into those. And this is the argument that I always argue for the

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:54.860
newer record and playback tools for web automation is they're quick. They're smart enough to not be

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.460
flaky. And if they ever get to a point where you've changed the UI so much, they can't figure

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.260
it out and keep going. Just record them again, because it's low effort. People talk about the

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:11.600
low code part, but it's low effort. I get a lot of ROI out of that because the effort is low.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.120
If I am spending, as I did in the past many, many years ago, days to weeks, I'll tell you

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.480
about I'll tell you a story here in a second to write test automation. And I get very little

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.980
return from that. I don't find any bugs or the bugs I find things we're going to fix.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.020
You know, maybe that's not right. So let me give you an example. Very, very early in my

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:40.220
career, I wrote UI animation, I haven't since then, I've looked at a little bit, but not

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:46.140
necessarily the UI animation, the folks get all excited about today, I've automated Win 32 by

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:53.730
putting messages into message loops and things like that. But Windows 98, I was working on

00:30:53.730 --> 00:31:00.370
networking, and particularly making sure that the new networking stack across our different

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:07.170
supported networks would handle code sets and all of the the Asian languages. And the thing with

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:12.530
Asian languages at the time Windows 9x, the consumer windows of the time, was that they were

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.850
mixed by meaning the special and like a Japanese, your kanji characters or Korean, your hangul

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:21.650
characters, they were a two byte character. So which caused all kinds of problems in network

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:28.290
names that they're parsed, weird, etc, etc. And, you know, Windows 95, but it's some ad hoc checking

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:32.770
of characters we knew would be bad and tried them and but didn't try every character for sure. So

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:41.220
one thing I did probably took me two full weeks to write was I wrote a little application that

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:47.360
would cycle through every single character in a given code page. Even if that code page had

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.480
thousands of characters, then do the canonical list of network connections, create a share with

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:58.240
those characters, connect to a server and create and create folders with those characters, copy

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.040
files with those characters around the varying lengths, all kinds of different stuff to try and

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:08.080
see if stuff would break. It was fun, you know, it took forever to run, as you can imagine.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.120
Yeah.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.760
On some systems. And there was ways to give it like I had like a at the time, remember any

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.480
files in any in Israel, YAML before YAML, but they're not but they're not markup dot

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.720
I files. Remember those? Oh, yeah, they still exist. I know they do in Windows. I haven't

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.320
seen one in years. So you could put little parameters in mind to make it like start and

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.240
stop at certain code points. We didn't want to run the whole thing handy. But it found,

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:37.100
you know, a good number of bugs across different networking components across characters. I mean,

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:42.300
and the majority of those got fixed because they were they were potentially real world

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.340
characters. I think the telemetry would tell you that most Asian users just used English

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:53.660
characters in their share name. So maybe not that exciting. But just looking back,

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.380
looking back here, I wrote a pretty complex thing. It was super cool. We ran it was probably run

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.620
thousands of times across the delivery of when 98 and Windows Millennium. Sorry, everybody.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.860
I still don't think we got the ROI out of that effort. In hindsight, I like if I would go back

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:15.380
in time, I would not write anything that complex. This is young programmer Alan trying to do

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.900
something cool. But in the big picture, there was probably a more efficient way to do that. That

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:27.620
would have there are higher ROIs for me to do to get the results of that testing I did.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:32.260
Right in comparison to the type of things you can do nowadays in two weeks, there's certainly

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.300
there's certainly a long list of higher ROI items. But I don't know.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:43.620
That's a very long way of saying we got to look at effort also. So you got to look at effort,

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.260
you got to look at the value of the bug, you got to look at some aspect of prioritization.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:56.110
I don't know what else to recap. I tell my team, you talk about effort. And when I when I go and

00:33:56.110 --> 00:34:01.790
talk to my team, and they're like, okay, well, what's your, how do you prioritize things? And I

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:08.430
say, oh, that's very clear. Like do the most important thing first. That's technology. I

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:16.430
basically say the number one thing, you need to come up with ways to articulate that your effort

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:24.750
is adding business value. Not a freshman college essay answer, be real, add business value. It's

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:30.430
not just reducing costs. It's more the ROI question. My second priority is reduce calendar

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:36.460
time. That is the only thing that I have not figured out how to scale. Right? Once you've

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:41.660
lost calendar time, it's gone. Third, reduce engineering time. That's kind of the effort.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.620
Right. So for for me, I don't know. I think if I were your manager at that time, and I go,

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:54.660
okay, these mixed bite things, these are weird. Is it worthwhile for for it was the Wild West on

00:34:54.660 --> 00:35:00.100
that team. They said, Alan, go write some tests. Everything was wild west back then.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.420
Back in those days. Let me give you another way to think about this. We can't do an AB test.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.060
Ideally, in a perfect world, you'd have one team that wrote a bunch of automation,

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:14.340
we have product code at the same time, and then shipped. And one team that didn't write any

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.260
automation at all and worked on a product, well, very little, and worked on a product,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:23.700
and then shipped, then shipped. You get more ROI if you're able to ship faster,

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.460
or with higher quality, or both with that automation.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:32.980
But that's not totally true either, because it adds automation retains value

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.460
for the next version of that product as well.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:41.460
Yeah, when I'm exploring when I'm shipping an actual MVP, right, there was a phase in the world

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:47.860
where MVP was just a synonym for beta. When I'm shipping an actual MVP, right now my team is

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:55.460
doing a concierge MVP. Love it. Love the concierge MVP. And you know what? We're not

00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.820
spending a whole lot of time on automation, right? Because that's not what's important.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:07.300
You wouldn't get a return on that investment. That's not going to be adding business value

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:13.140
at this time. What's important at this phase is understanding, do we actually have a product?

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:18.020
Do we have something people want to use? In terms of the one product that I'm thinking about

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:23.780
right now, I'll tell you, we did this big announcement event last week, and we absolutely

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:30.100
do. Right? I have people coming to me out of the blue, trying to figure out how to be on my

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:36.660
early adopters list. And I'm like, yeah, I can't scale to support you. I don't want to go too

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:42.820
fast. Once I validated it, then it's a more around lockdown, get execution and make sure

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:49.700
we're able to operationalize that execution. Small bugs, I really don't care about us being

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:54.020
sloppy on check ins and things like that. That will hurt our reputation.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:37:02.050
So the recap short answer for Percy is actually, I think he said this sounds more like a thought

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:06.690
experiment, which our answer says it kind of is. But there's a lot of things to think about that

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:13.170
can help you figure out if you're getting good or bad, or if you could get better or worse ROI

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:20.400
on that investment. For me in a nutshell is compare it to your top two and three alternatives.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.360
And that's going to tell you what the ROI is. Yeah. And Percy's been in the industry long enough.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.080
It is. But this but this answer is for everyone. Percy asks, we're giving it to everyone, I think.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.120
And again, I said this last time, and I restate it again, I think our industry is has an

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:44.240
infatuation with UI automation. And I would think a lot of folks and who are writing a crap,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.560
the teams are specialized automation teams writing a crap ton of selenium, I can guarantee you,

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.520
they're not getting full, they're not getting ROI from those tests, they're getting value,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.960
value is different from ROI, they're getting value from those tests. They're not getting value from

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.160
the effort they're putting into writing those tests, because they're a pain in the ass to

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.880
write. And they're probably not finding a great set of bugs. And they're probably not giving you

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.400
a bunch of value over time, because they're flaky. Yeah, the thing the thing that I've kind of

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.600
saved until now, which probably is unfortunate. I don't know that I agree that the point of an

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:26.080
automated test is the fine bug. No, and I don't think I will. I don't think we said that we did

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:32.480
say what kind of bugs does it bind? Well, it's a safety net, which we hate, but it is in a way.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.880
People talk about unit tests giving you confidence in your ability to change the code, because you

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:42.080
know, if you screwed up anything, you'll know. But all the tests give you, you want the test to let

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.640
you know if you screwed up. That's one, you'll also want the tests, you want to be able to trust

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:54.850
the tests and that if they pass, they're actually passing. Right? Sure. And I think we may have

00:38:54.850 --> 00:39:02.370
talked about at Microsoft, there was this one, extremely huge team ran through their whole suite

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:07.890
without actually having the product even installed and some ungodly number of their tests pass.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:13.490
Famous story. Right. All right. Well, hopefully that's some that's some enough food for thought

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:18.370
to get you thinking, Percy, and get somebody else. And all right, we got to get going. I got a thing

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:23.890
to go to. And Brent's probably got a thing to go to. And it is hot out in Seattle and my dog's

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:30.850
hungry and I got to go. And I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we will talk to you next time on A B testing.
