WEBVTT

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.370
Brent almost spoke first, but I dove in ahead on the microphone and the cool thing is is that even if you would have spoken first

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.870
This morning. I would have edited you out

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.110
Cuz I'm a dick and I'm Brent

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.320
My

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.340
Goodness. Oh my goodness. So we are here for episode

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.220
66 double sixes double sixes I guess sixes

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.720
There's a friend of mine

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.480
This is total non. Well, it's tangential. I'm not gonna call a total non sequitur

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.060
His friend was in a band and the name of one of their albums was six six eight the neighbor of the beast

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.990
On the same side of the street

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.300
Hey

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.260
So we're gonna say something I was okay cool any exciting adventures in your life this week

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.900
Not so far week was pretty pretty straightforward. I'm heading to Helsinki today. Oh

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.520
So not yet

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.240
Not yet flying to Chicago shy town spending an hour and a half hour and a half there in the lovely airport and then flying from

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.920
There to Helsinki shy town Chicago. Oh got chai town. Yeah. Yeah, whatever

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.280
one thing speaking of so you're kicking off your kick-ass day of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.380
Travel yeah

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.180
Travel I'm all packed, you know, I cannot invent

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.020
self

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.900
dry self

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.420
propelling everything fast enough and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.280
Personal self propelling everything fast enough or teleportation after we record here

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.540
I'm heading into the office just long enough to pack up my desk and move it about 20 feet away

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.180
I'm giving my desk

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.740
I have a new hire starting on my team

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.700
The Monday when I get back and I'm giving my desk to him so he can sit closer to the rest of the team

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.340
I'm sort of it's I'm overhead ish I can be moved anywhere. Yeah, that I completely understand

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.900
I do the same thing. Hey, I don't know if I've mentioned this and I'm pretty sure I haven't to you even

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.740
fairly close within a thousand miles proximity to Helsinki is

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.380
Moscow and I am heading to the Heisenberg testing conference in Moscow this December

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.310
Okay, are you gonna be hanging out in Helsinki until that time? No, I'm coming back

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.550
But I forgot I'm giving a talk. I'm gonna give

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.030
spin on my technical testing

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.870
Talk as a keynote. I started editing that yesterday because I'm gonna do another spin on it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.750
I can't give the same exact same talk twice

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.910
So I was gonna make some small tweaks because I'm actually giving a talk when I'm in Helsinki and a meetup there

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.650
There are already like 50 people signed up at the Unity offices should be fun

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.740
I'm going to do a spin on technical testing talk I gave for the online testing conference. I

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.740
Started making some tweaks and ended up kind of redoing the whole presentation, which is good for me because it keeps it fresh

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.940
I like to change it and I'll probably do the same thing for Heisenberg

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.500
I'm also going to give a talk on the use and abuse of test automation

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.460
Which is?

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.780
Obviously related to part of my rant in that I'll make sure there's a good separation between the two for the talk

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.020
Are you gonna throw in some over the top embellishments?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.400
for example

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.670
The reason why I ask will make the example super clear to you. Anyway, I

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.670
Think the testing community is is at a loss

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.830
Now that Whitaker is focused on how AI is gonna change. Oh, that's right

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.690
Nobody's being mad and with Bach kind of out of the picture to nobody's really out there causing controversy

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.310
Even when I go try and cause controversy and say things like the role of test automator is going away

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.030
I are I have people like Richard Bradshaw who make a living doing test automation going. Yeah, you're pretty much, right?

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.270
Or the role of tests is as information providers is going away. Yeah

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.210
like I mean

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.740
You're gonna have to like there's it there's an there is a hole there

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.640
I think you can fill it but you're gonna have to step up your game on there is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.440
Let me think about it may not be the right audience to do that

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.940
but in my head, I just visit I just visualized a

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.830
Normal distribution curve. Yeah, and

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.970
with modern testing sort of being in the

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.830
Towards the front end of that wave of the curve, but keeping in mind that a lot of testing is

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.550
Back there right as I as I gesture

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.030
Yeah, no, no, you're I mean you're you're in the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.080
You're in and from Mike's

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840
Knowledge of it you're near

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.200
Outlier on the the normal distribution, but you're not there yet. You're still kind of in the oh, yes is normal

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.320
But you know high on the normal range got a ways to go. Yeah, get a ways. I mean, it's fine much

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.880
You just got to be more you know plus plus on drama. All right, I will work on the drama

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.560
Hey, so I have something that was exciting this week. Oh, hey, Brent. Did you have anything exciting this week? Hey, yes

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.560
I did. Thank you for asking Alan

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.180
I'm a sucky co-host

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.660
My mother-in-law is right

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.180
You you're like you're like mom look there's a reason why the podcast starts with a

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.740
Anyway, no

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.540
There is speaking of

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.180
Vacuous holes there is now a vacuous hole in one of the bedrooms in my house

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.080
You mentioned your last in the last episode that you're approaching a

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.900
Partial empty nest

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.300
Hey, has it become the man cave yet? No, actually what we're gonna do is my a sewing room

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.180
No, my my middle son. Mm-hmm

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.420
Is gonna move into that in terms of like real estate

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.160
And not the master. That's the best of the non master bedrooms. Ah

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.760
So someone's getting an upgrade someone's getting an upgrade like yeah, that was an interesting experience

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.000
It's kind of like when someone leaves like if someone leaves the team

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.890
Like if it's a good office someone will immediately claim it versus let the new guy have it

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.990
Yeah, so just a couple of nutshell things that I learned from the experience

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.550
first and foremost

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.670
he's going to school in wazoo and

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.270
From where we're at that is a five and a half hour drive one way

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.310
Yep, unless it's winter then it's 12. I took

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:25.160
Wednesday off and I did that trip in one day there help them unpack back

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.580
That was extremely unpleasant

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.420
Yeah, because it's not all for those

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.340
Even Washingtonians wouldn't know that necessarily but it's not even freeway the whole way a big chunk of the trip

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.340
It's just on a two-lane road

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.630
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.700
There's a thing I found the most interesting. So my son

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:55.170
while he was at at home the last few years he generally liked to spend most of his time in his room and

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.740
I've been prepping for empty nest syndrome for like the last three years

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:07.080
But when the day hits you no matter prep makes a difference

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.960
Right, so you talked last time like hey, yeah, no, I've

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.560
I've been since before the kids were born. I've been looking forward to when they leave and

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.320
You know what when you're in the moment

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.760
All of that stuff that you hold on to like I can't wait till they leave goes out the window

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.310
It was it was and I'm generally

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.240
Generally my EQ is quite low

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.500
People go. Oh, thank you. Carry much about me and I'm like, yeah

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.220
What is faking?

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.240
But with him

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.240
It was an interesting

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.560
For me. I'm just I had like a 10-minute speech that I wanted to talk to him as sort of the final words of daddiness and

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.300
That took me a good 40 minutes to get out

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.700
I

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:08.740
Print I've never known you to be long-winded. No, it wasn't was those long wind I was I kept on choking up

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.230
Yeah

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.900
and then going home

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.880
I go home and

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.160
It's still instinctive. I'm like, oh

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.040
Alex's cars not here. I wonder where he is. Oh

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800
Anyway, yeah, that was

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.040
Life changing moments in the gentle, you know minor rites of passage

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.320
This is my first one through it and I'm like, oh, this is interesting

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.340
I got a ways to go any prediction on what episode we're on when my soon to be eighth grader goes off to college

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.620
So four years maybe two hundred two

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.140
Can you imagine? Yeah. All right

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.180
Like your youngest

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:59.060
My youngest is going into seventh grade. Yeah, I'm actually thinking like when my youngest

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:07.060
Goes goes off. We'll probably be done with the podcast cuz you'll have been dead by then probably yeah. Yeah. Yeah

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220
love the support

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.020
Hey, you know, I'm just a couple years away from being all about ageism

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.020
No, you ageist like I'll be joining your party. Yeah

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.860
although I have to say and

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:32.380
You can't tell on the podcast but I look much younger than Brad

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.230
Yes, he does. All right. Yeah. Hey

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:45.780
Once again, I would like to thank the fine folks at Techwell and star conferences for sponsoring this episode of a B testing

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.360
That's it

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.000
Kidding I'm kidding. I'm kidding. So I am

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.920
excited to say that

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:06.160
Star Canada is returning to Toronto. You've been to Toronto. I have not great city. They have a great soccer team

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
I haven't even been to Canada in

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:16.300
Probably 20 years. Oh really? Yeah, I gave a few talks at Star Canada in Vancouver

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.660
Three years ago. It was just a fact. I love they take such good terror speakers. It's a great conference

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.700
Always a big fan of the star conferences. So returning to downtown Toronto in October

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.620
Which means that it's playoff time and Toronto FC are definitely making the playoffs

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:41.580
Just in case those two coincide I will stop I will stop promoting Toronto FC who are not a sponsor of this podcast and get back

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.660
To star so Toronto in October is star Canada

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.660
If you've not yet attended a star conference, there has never been a better time to join the fun

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:57.100
And I agree it will have over 50 testing sessions to choose from for a week packed with learning and networking

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:02.640
Opportunities and I would like to emphasize that luck always lots of great information in the talks

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.360
I think the networking and talking to people and spending time

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.740
Talking to other testers talking to speakers is a huge part of the value you get from a conference

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.260
conferring

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.560
Talking is so important

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:25.820
There will be keynotes from recognized thought leaders Dorothy Graham Graham who wrote a couple books on test automation been in testing for a while

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.300
Very knowledgeable Jeffrey Payne

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.380
Good. I've met Jeffrey a few times

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:39.400
Knows a ton about agile. I'll just put it that way. I'm really really really respect him Isabel Evans and Janet Gregory

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.960
Who is Lisa Christmas co-author on the agile testing books?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.880
Also for the first time at Star Canada, there will be a test lab where you can break software air quotes for a good cause

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:58.640
In fact, the test lab is partnering with play-doh testing an organization truly making a social impact by helping the Aboriginal people of Canada

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.280
Become experts in software testing

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:09.080
Students from play-doh testing will be attending star Canada on scholarship and will be assisting other attendees while in the test lab

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.640
That sounds fun. I love if you've been to a conference and they do like a test lab

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.400
I love diving into this. I love getting an excuse to I'm still trying to figure out what play-doh testing is. Oh, it's right

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.480
It's play-doh, it's P L A T. Oh, oh

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.760
It's my annunciation my enunciations, which is failing

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.200
Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.520
Sorry

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:42.360
Students from play-doh testing will be attending star Canada on scholarship as I mentioned and assisting other attendees while in the test lab

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.640
If you are thinking about attending star Canada, and why wouldn't you be?

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:37.110
Well dot TC whack go star Canada. I will post all of this information

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:43.390
In the blog post which I will likely I'll likely edit this podcast on my flight

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.060
Tonight interesting note remember to bring headphones. Okay?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.680
Mental note anyway star Canada a be testing earbuds on the plane. That's excellent. I kind of need I

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:03.360
Guaranteed I'm sitting next to a screaming child or a very large person or

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.560
Someone who hasn't showered in three months

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:13.560
Yes, or all one person a screaming baby who hasn't showered

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:20.750
Hey, so one of the things before you go too much further, right?

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.810
So as we've talked about before

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:32.350
We don't view ourselves as a professional podcast necessarily. I think we are ebbing on

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.790
Professionalism, I don't know what you're talking about anyway continue. Okay, so we're half of this room

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.830
We're an ebbing the a half one half may be more professional than the other

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.350
but on the sponsors

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:53.730
We would not be sponsoring them on the show if if it's not if it was something we didn't agree with

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.170
Absolutely. We are we are

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.360
not

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.840
Anyway shape or form at a point where we're doing this

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.860
For the money we're doing this because we're old geezers and we like to talk and we want to share

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.680
absolutely and

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.070
the star

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.430
conferences

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.460
They are keeping pace. I think well

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.020
Certainly better than other conferences. I'm a perhaps

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.120
There's one other that I could think of that that is on the same line, but because this one's sponsored by Techwell

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.700
I'm not gonna mention that one, but if you're an avid listener to this

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.520
podcast because

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.340
you you value what we're saying because you think we're

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.100
Taking a different point of view that isn't

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:56.180
Out there. I'm gonna tell you if you want to get more information on this that is aligned with the content of what we talk about here

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:03.500
Consider star I agree with everything Brent said which is weird

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.940
Yeah, let's move on before you think too much about it

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.380
Yeah, I do want to reemphasize

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:19.580
We get spot as you can tell being a listener we get people asking if they can sponsor our show for a

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.790
Nominal fee and I'm always happy to do that if the product is something

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.800
That I think that I would want to use myself or I have used myself or something

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.540
I believe our listeners or I think it's it's yeah, it's in line with like yeah

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:41.460
This is this is I think beneficial happy to happy to pass on some savings opportunities. Yep

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.170
Okay, so on with the Kanban board over here the

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.050
Prioritized list and speaking of Kanban one thing I wanted to mention is

00:17:53.690 --> 00:18:00.930
For many many years. I've used personal Kanban to sort of track my work and I and I merge it

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:06.970
It's it's work stuff. It's personal stuff everything from pay the bills to do these tasks

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:14.010
Interestingly, I stopped using personal Kanban about a year ago quite a while

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.270
And I did it because I had read

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:23.210
JD Myers book. I don't know if you read his book call getting results the agile way and

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.710
I was ready

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:33.190
I'm always ready to experiment and try something new and he and the idea is you list out. I'm putting this I apologize JD for

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.260
Totally paraphrasing your concepts down to nothing, but it's a good book

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.780
three goals for the month

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.480
That you set at the beginning of the month three goals for the week

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:51.740
You set on Monday morning or Sunday night and then three goals every day. I did that for a while and

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.490
What happened with that is I came I went in and out of it

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.870
There's some good things I liked and I'll come back to that in a minute

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.590
I used it for quite a while, but it ended up being more like a to-do list and

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:10.350
A to-do list in my experience ends up being stuff you never do

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.780
So I just I just did what needed to be done and didn't really track things that closely

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.100
I still liked doing the three goals for the month. I always did that I

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.780
Will probably continue to still do that

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.700
But the reason I bring it up is I went back to personal Kanban two weeks ago

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.380
but I'm gonna go back and give this a try and

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.790
It's like coming back to a long-lost friend my

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.970
my productivity and and

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.330
throughput are just

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.820
Thought that they were awful before but definitely accelerated

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.660
It's just it's a it's a I just wanted to give a shout out to it for those that haven't

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:56.220
Or haven't thought about doing it as a way to track the items that you work on but it's it's

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.060
for me, I

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:06.150
realized it definitely works and it's just something that it's it it's a way for me to get things done Oh

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:13.550
Jim Benson. Yeah, Jim Benson wrote a book on personal Kanban. I got to go to a seminar. He gave once which was excellent

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.900
and

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.740
anyway, just want to give a shout out to the concept because it's

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.700
No advertisement here

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.260
But if but it's sort of this along the same lines of it's something I believe in something

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.420
I think it would be beneficial beneficial to a B testing listeners

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:38.340
So I wanted to give it a few moments to share now Brent's making a face or he's I'm making himself

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:46.540
I'm making a face. Tell me why you're making a face. Mr. Brent getting things done the agile way and that's the implementation

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.430
well

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.430
WTF so I again

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:58.630
I squished an entire book which is pretty good and filled with some great anecdotes and stories down to a nutshell

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.540
It's an alternate prioritization scheme

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:08.860
I do and again one thing I will you want to know when I learned that party prioritization scheme

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.750
kindergarten, no, I once attended a

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.610
seminar

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.940
put on by Franklin Covey

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.340
whose job was to sell taskbooks and

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:28.980
This particular seminar was how to align the tasks of Microsoft Project

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.780
Oh

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.260
my like

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.280
God, I'm like

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:42.440
Wow, I wish you had talked to me about before you started executing that model and abandoning personal count-bound because I would have

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:50.560
Mocked your waterfall. What what happened was and actually it worked at the task level

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:57.340
It doesn't work for me. It's worked when I needed sort of meta level goals like I need to

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:04.840
Something that I take care of this requires multiple things for me to do the personal bond addresses that I know personal compound is much better

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.020
and so I

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:11.900
Basically, I just fell away. I used it for I used personal compound for a long long time and

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:18.500
I just for some reason I read this book wanted to try something new and I tried it for a while and it was okay

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.660
But not good enough. I wanted to keep on using it

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:26.260
So I fell into nothing for a while and then just recently came back to personal compound. So that's kind of my

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:33.990
I don't know about how you feel about this. Like you mentioned you can't do the same presentation twice, right?

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:40.770
I will say that my view the agile community isn't innovating fast enough for

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.560
me at this moment in time because

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:53.970
If I'm executing the same model over and over and over and over and over and over and over even though it's the in

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.110
My view the best model there is I get bored with it

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:04.010
And I'm like and this is why this is why I tried the new system because this is exactly why I don't give the same

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:09.250
Presentation twice as I want to even if I give it the second time my attempt is to make it better and it's worse

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.890
Now well, I changed it at least I tried something new

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.190
Same thing here. I tried something new. I always want to tweak

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.930
What I'm doing what I'm building

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.410
Anything I want to tweak and see if I can make it better

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.590
See if I can make it more interesting see if I can learn more from it

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.650
So what I've done

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:33.490
When I first learned personal Kanban, I I ran with it for a very long time

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:40.770
and then I went and did the safe training and then I took some concepts from safe and

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:46.440
tweaked how I did my personal Kanban, but now I'm at a point where

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:54.280
There's no difference between my team board and my board. I just put it all on the one

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.250
Right in as you know, I've I've done

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.490
I still have to document this one day, but I've I've

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.220
Made my own version of

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.920
An agile process that in my view is a is

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.950
It's probably context sensitive, but it's very effective for the world

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.670
I live in and it takes bits and pieces from these different models

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.200
But it's now on the same. It's all on the same board

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:26.790
So

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:32.190
Let's go into tangent bill a bit. Okay, did a little theme song for that

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.510
Recently had a discussion and a

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.710
Something I want to try discussion with one of my team members

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.090
it led to something I want to try is I

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.750
am in charge of

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.920
More teams than I can count

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:53.200
More features than I can count more feature teams and I can't count very high, but it's more than I'll fit on my fingers

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.360
each has their own product backlog and of course because

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.180
My team members are embedded on feature teams. Their work items are are part of the feature team

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.080
boards I

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.680
Was thinking it would be cool. I want to start

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.360
And I'll get into this tangent in a minute

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:18.020
I want to start finding ways for a few more cross team sort of projects and more sharing

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:24.580
One of the things I think I'm going to do and actually one of the things I'm going to do is find a way to tag

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.730
items effect I'm acting like this is difficult. I'm going to tag the

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:37.010
The quality the QA items on the individual boards so that I can view a master board of all the anyway

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:42.330
Actually, anyone can view a master board of all the QA items across the organization. Okay

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.630
Hoping that if people view that they might inspire like oh, this is kind of like this

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.470
We should talk about this as people are working on some more cross functional tools

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:56.510
across team tools find some ways to connect on those and this leads into

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.370
my team needs some

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:07.390
My organization services organization needs a manager who can actually complete a sentence for one

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.230
Definitely leadership to back to number one

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.300
As I show my favorite finger

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.280
Yep

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.520
My team the organization needs some

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.360
There's some tools we need across the services organization

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:26.880
Okay

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.240
What the engine team at unity add has is something they called a toolsmith org small number of people that kind of old miss

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.640
Toolsmiths Oh Smith's okay who work on infrastructure and tools for the testing org

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.640
Ideally, I would have a few people in the services org dedicated to that

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.910
I don't have any head count for that

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:51.290
I can start peeling some people toward that over the long term or

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.310
I could do kind of what I did when I was on the Xbox team

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.630
Where I had no one reporting to me but was in charge of building all of the

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.550
Organizing the building of all of the testing tools for Xbox

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:12.380
Okay, and I'm hoping that in building some visibility

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.060
Towards what we need across the org that I can start building some cross

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:24.040
Team hey, I don't want to call them a virtual team because you know, I'm allergic to that term cross

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.340
team

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.140
Initiatives to build some of those things and get people working together

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.680
It's not open source, but generally the term I use under this is shared source

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.120
Yeah, and shared initiative. This is this is my world of Warcraft guide to project management

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.470
I will say that once you break the boundary and

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.430
Between the organizations and you get people

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.630
volunteering

00:27:52.630 --> 00:28:00.590
To do that shift magic really starts to happen. Yeah, and but it's so hard to get them to do that. I

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:07.630
This is where I live. I I'm a as you know, I'm a more of a community builder than a manager

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:14.710
I am confident and excited more excited than confident that I can get this to happen. I think I have never

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.580
Never worked with the team more eager to learn and try new things

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:27.580
Than this organization at Unity. So I'm it frightens me sometimes when I plant seeds and they grow so fast

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.020
if I were in your shoes

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.840
With what I understand of what you

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:39.450
What powers you have in versus what you don't

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.410
one of the things that I may

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.730
consider is

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:52.030
To bootstrap this bootstrap this along with sort of a long-term strategy, which you'll it's context sensitive

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:58.730
I don't have enough information to guide you on it offer a one-off bonus program where

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:05.170
Successfully completing and checking in work that belongs to another team

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:11.360
You're gonna artificially reward that with a one-off sort of yeah, I do want to

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.840
There is the idea of the spot bonus that I want to I want to be able to yes, I

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.070
I'm gonna figure out a way to make that happen. Yeah, and

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.450
The great thing is is unlike Microsoft that would be a pipe dream and ever get to do actually when I there's something

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:29.690
I think I want to make happen

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.810
It does it's not like automatically it happens

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:36.730
But usually we can find a way there were times in my career where I had the ability to influence it

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:44.090
But now that I'm in a front manager role the incentives have to be more Daniel pink related and not necessarily money

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:51.170
Yeah, and ideally which are more powerful as we as we know, but they're harder to you can do getting it across

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.640
Definitely do both

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.280
Don't do money and not

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:04.090
Have not and not praise you have to do both. Hey speaking of praising. Yeah, let's go on to the next topic. Oh

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.370
Yeah, which has very little to do with praising

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.060
In fact maybe the opposite yeah, so you wrote the item down

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.780
I'll let you set this up and then I'll make a face and tear it apart

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:22.240
Yeah, so it's it's I've agreed with you enough for one day. Just so you know

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.150
Sorry

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.560
Sorry, yeah, my

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:35.860
How many times can Alan interrupt there is so at Microsoft we're at the we're out of the review process and

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.320
This topic is something that Alan and I have been sort of talking about

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:50.860
Outside of the podcast and given our last theme was really around management and leadership our last podcast. Yep. I remember I was there. Yep

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.090
one of the things I realized that we really didn't talk about in terms of

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.050
Management philosophy and

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:09.600
One of the worst the most unpleasant things that managers have to do and that is communicating bad messages

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.500
Now I'll start off

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:21.160
basically saying at this one of the things that's a full philosophical foundation for me is

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.190
Surprises and adjectives are

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.790
criminal

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:33.550
Surprise what do you mean by adjectives because I've said the first statement before but

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.430
Adjectives I know what an adjective is but give me an example in the situation

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.430
This person was awesome this person sucked

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.960
The the well those are judgments which are also bad

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.210
but adjectives best worst

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.400
Adjectives are criminal when it comes to

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:05.480
But it certainly when it comes to communicating bad message messages in my humble opinion. Yeah, and

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.240
Good, I get that and the that first part of it is the most important. So a bad message should never be a surprise

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.560
for sure, it's

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.840
We had

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.330
And I'll bring us up a couple times because I've had even as a non manager

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.410
I took a lot of management training at Microsoft

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.890
Just because I was in a leadership position because that's to go because I was in engineering excellence as part of what I did

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.170
So I've had a few decades of different sorts of management training

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.210
I had a leadership training at unity took two days and

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.880
Of course knowing you knowing me I walked in very skeptical

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.920
Then ah, yeah, it was the best

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.200
Management training I've ever had

00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.200
Nice and not to say it was awesome from end to end. There are a few points where I did ask the BTF

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.560
but it was great because I could ask the BTF and and

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:09.970
Just unity culture of transparency and respect if I do it. I said I don't get how this it was great

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:14.370
Yeah, great. Great. Um, and they there was a couple things that

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.490
One of the bits of feedback I gave they asked us to sort of invent like not invent

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.970
but think of some critical feedback you need to give someone in your team and

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.680
Frame it in this framework, which I may talk about in a little bit if relevant and I did it

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.160
But I said I told him this feels contrived because

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.860
by the time

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:40.180
The conversation that it would never get this far to this

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:46.580
I would have mentioned this to them. We would have had discussions about this five ten times before we had this

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.100
Air-quote fierce feedback conversation

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.510
Okay, so which goes into the surprise it's like

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.230
brit

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.470
When you interrupt me on the podcast

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.000
It causes me to feel blah blah blah or and and this little lot to happen

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.560
And so what's up?

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.810
So what should we what's your point? What should we do about it?

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:17.810
Ignore your feedback and versus just ignoring him for having going bread. I hate you. I quit

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.610
You want to bring up that critical feedback

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.130
Wait, so as soon as you need it the the punch line to this is is

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:33.250
To then shift to Socratic and say what should we do about it? No, I'm

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.880
I'm uh

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.040
Giving a very bad example of giving you to the point and critical feedback

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.000
before it escalates to a point where it's a

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.080
it's uh

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.360
a job ending or a review diving feedback. Yes

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.120
and

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.680
As you know, and this is one of my beefs at Microsoft is I've had

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:03.030
Almost every single one of my managers only gave me feedback during reviews

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.800
Especially my last one. I had one manager who I was

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.080
Maybe two months into a new job at Microsoft and I asked him. Hey, how am I doing? His response was?

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.640
Oh, wow. I didn't know you're gonna put me on the spot

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.460
Um

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.900
Yeah, I know that one too and often you talk about review season while i'm on a little bit of a soapbox and rant

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:34.660
Yep, as you know many Microsoft managers will customize your feedback

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.360
based on

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.000
How much of a raise or not raise they're able to give you well. Yeah, there's I mean

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.000
We got to quote unquote own the message

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.400
Yeah

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.400
but the thing is is that

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.040
and just going back to the original point is

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.180
if

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.000
you

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.040
I'm

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:04.800
My blood's boiling a little bit while I try and talk about this is that you have to give people that feedback

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:11.280
All the time. So you I you have one-on-ones with your team frequently as do I as do most good managers

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.400
That can't just be a status report meaning I

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.320
Sometimes it is I try to explicitly ban

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.780
I got I have a daily stand-up. I have a weekly retrospective

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.040
um

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:33.400
If i'm not aware of the status, there's something else really wrong

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.660
Yeah, it's a little different for me. Well, i'll take a little bit of status just because i'm so spread out

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.860
And it's mainly as a way for me to draw out ways that I can help help you

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.500
You as my employee. Yeah

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.580
So i'll say well, tell me more about that. Is that is there is that going as well as it could or something?

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.260
I can do that those sorts of conversations. I think if I were in your role

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.820
There's one technique an old manager of mine taught me if I were in your role

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.920
I would for sure do this

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.720
Uh, because you're you're trying to find those things where hey

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.670
I'm a manager. I have resources

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Um, I know stuff

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.540
I'm talking to your peers

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.900
Let me help you and kind of goes to what I was talking about last time about

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.260
My perspective that i'm a management service provider and not a manager

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.380
Um, but the the technique is very simple

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.010
I tell tell my reports

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:38.690
Look, I don't care if you do it even literally two minutes before the meeting

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.460
But I want you to send me an agenda for our 101

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.060
Now this sounds super managerial

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.500
But what happens when you send the agenda and you also say

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.860
I don't give a rat's ass about status reports

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200
It forces them to think through

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.480
What the hell they need you for?

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.560
Yeah, and I do that for yeah

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.460
I don't do that consistently

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:10.500
But for what I've found is when I find that that doesn't come out naturally in a one-on-one

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.060
I begin to ask for that or it sort of comes out organically for having like these

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.620
If we're not having good conversations, I definitely fall to that but I should do that for everyone on the team

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.680
Send me send me one to one to n number of things you want to talk about

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.600
Because I like then framing that is and it helps me figure out how I can help you

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.530
I specifically frame it as look i'm your msp

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.360
We're meeting

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:43.120
There there's some value you're hoping to to get from me from your time invested. Mm-hmm

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.530
Think about it about what?

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.160
That might be

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.240
Got it, right because so often

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.760
You have these one-on-ones and it ends up being a defensive conversation along the lines of

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.720
Why something hasn't been done?

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.730
Right, and i'm like, I don't want to talk about that in one of ones

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:09.990
Right, except for where actually I take that back except for where that does

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.670
That is related to that individual's career growth

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.080
Like as an example, I run a data science team, but as they've blogged about

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.270
It's not a specialist team

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:29.860
I have people who are comfortable with some things and they can integrate but they're developers

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.680
that report to me

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.480
And for the time period that we've been in

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.450
Up until now that's great

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:41.250
But it's not going to help them in the next couple of years

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:45.810
And so i'm having conversations around. Okay. How do you go this even further?

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.030
But i'm communicating bad messages

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.050
Hey, someone stepped over the line

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:59.250
Or it's just not working out. You're now at the 11th 11th time having the same conversation

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.650
And you're realizing it's not a fit and you're firing them

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:09.010
Or it's a review process and whatever your company's review process is

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.210
Most people look at the numbers and that is ultimately the review they care about

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.800
and

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.200
How how do you communicate those things?

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.680
now

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.640
That that particular is where I think adjectives

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.880
suck

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.840
Yeah, and my my absolute least favorite one

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:36.240
Oh, yeah, you're getting this because you weren't visible enough. Oh my god that adjective. I just these are my

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.040
But there is a better way of doing it instead of adjectives for example

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.360
communicate

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.080
actions

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.440
uh

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.440
One of the things that I have found

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:56.600
Extremely helpful in this one. I've actually so back in the day when you remember when we had these labels at microsoft

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.320
Like underperform limited

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.560
Yeah, that thing

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.400
I've I've actually communicated a ul message and had the guy thank me afterwards

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:10.200
Yeah

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.000
I have

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.840
any manager

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.440
Managers don't like

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.240
Giving harsh feedback. It's a difficult thing for anyone to do

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.680
But it's it's if you need to be a machine build need to be able to do it

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.480
I fired someone once I had to let someone go they weren't a fit and they thanked me as well

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.590
um

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:33.830
But the reason was surprising the reason was immediately. Thank you. Yes

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:41.210
It was not a surprise. Oh, I see because we when there's a performance problem. You need to bring it up immediately

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.830
and talk about the impact it's causing and then have

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:52.390
Continued conversations about that if things aren't improving and when it got to the point it was not

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:57.190
Just like surprises or criminal the firing was not a surprise

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.930
He and I both knew it wasn't a fit

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:06.610
uh, I said it's not about you personally just not it's not working out and

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:12.210
He thanked me in in that that entire 15 minute conversation where I

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.570
Was prepared for him to be defensive and and in my head i'm thinking now is not the time to be defensive

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.930
We've talked about you know, we've talked about this before but it was

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.670
Again, because I had had multiple conversations leading up to it

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.350
the

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.190
letting the person go

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.910
Was pleasant on both sides. I was I was

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.870
uh proud of the way he acted and

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.710
And happy for both of it both of us. I just kind of worked out that way

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:44.310
He will be successful and probably is successful in some other position now, but at the time

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.630
uh, it just again, it worked out like it's supposed to

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.470
I

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.500
one of the things that I have

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.780
So first and foremost it has actually been a very long time

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:04.980
Since i've actually had to take the step of actually firing somebody because a microsoft is moving to another team, right? No, I don't

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500
Sorry dig dig

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:15.700
Well, actually so in some cases I will if it's a if it's purely a fit problem, right for sure, right? Um, there's

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.780
I I had to deal with that just in the last couple of years

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.460
Where what they like to do and what they did well

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.340
Was not something

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.140
My organization was willing to pay them to do it

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.100
I also believe this goes a little bit what talked about last time

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:38.260
I'll let you get back on topic is our job as a manager is to find the net always be looking for the next best

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.740
role for all of our employees and

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:46.340
Ideally that role is something on our teams because if they're especially they're a top performer, but sometimes it's not

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:47.940
No

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.940
Sometimes that next big role i'm moving one of the people on my team at unity to a different team outside of services because that's

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.700
Where their passions are where they're uh where they have a lot of excellence both demonstrated and past experience

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.900
So it's this just the right thing to do. I I I completely agree. There's an emotional argument to that

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:09.220
There's a there's a logical argument to as well for um, for example

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:17.640
Uh, so I generally take the the more logical argument, right? I don't view firing as a negative thing

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.840
Particularly with the strategy that I do where I I find surprises

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.570
criminal

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:30.450
Right. I well in advance like i'm pretty good at seeing at this point in time

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:35.570
I'm pretty good at seeing patterns and seeing the future particular individuals and see when

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:40.770
They're on a path that's going to diverge and and sort of the timeline when it's going to be

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.920
Negative for them. Yeah

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.240
And get them ahead and get them starting to act

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:53.040
And I try to stay in the coaching realm as much as possible like the last individual I talked

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.040
Was just in the last couple of years. I said look if if there isn't a change

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:05.040
You're not going to be talking to coach brent anymore. You're going to be talking to manager brent

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.800
And manager brent

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.600
Has to worry about his business and has to worry about how his resources are applied

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.160
And there are very specific things that he has to do when things are out of alignment

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.800
So what and we don't want to have a conversation with manager brent

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.160
So let's figure out how we solve this while it's still coach brent

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.000
So what techniques or frameworks do you have for giving if any?

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:37.660
For or maybe it's contextual for giving that critical feedback when needed. It's always contextual

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.280
but

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.320
there is

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.600
I will say that if there is secret sauce to this

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.080
is

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.880
Your feedback cannot contain adjectives. They must instead contain

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.160
actions

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.640
So I think of it as a retrospective

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.120
And then I go

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.160
So people want to know how do they get in this space?

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.160
Okay, so yeah, you're going to have to cover some sort of contextual

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.460
You know what lettuce here?

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.460
But what I then do in in my conversation is i'll go

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.750
Hey

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.750
You know looking back on this now

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:24.790
It's very clear to me

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.830
That if you had taken these sets of actions instead of the ones that you took

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.980
That would have led you to a much better place

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.440
And moving forward it is critical

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.700
That you continue to take these type of actions, but that's not the stuff I love to do

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:46.180
It's an often often thing because another thing that that happens

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.780
Is people like but i'm awesome

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.580
Why I why aren't I being rewarded for being awesome?

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.880
and

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:02.040
This a lot of times employees don't really understand this

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.360
Fitness concept it sounds like management speak

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.770
I'm like look

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:12.610
I'll give you i'll give you an example. Uh, I had a guy

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.960
A few years back was just a talented

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.920
Uh build engineer one of the best

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:24.290
But I was in an organization that gave a rat's ass

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:29.760
And and i'm like it's so you know going back to what I talked about last time that's that

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.120
That um venn diagram what you do

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.960
Well what you like to do and what you can get paid to do and I said look

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.080
Yeah, you know what what you're doing is valuable

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:47.040
But it's never going to it's never going to be in this team and the problems that we have

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.120
It's never going to stack high

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.460
invaluable results

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.410
It's just not

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:58.290
I want to be clear on one thing which is that when you give the critical fee, it's not always about firing someone

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:02.290
No, it's about more often than not. It's just about course corrections

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:08.610
So i'm fully it's always about course. I I mentioned in the last podcast. It's more relevant now

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.690
This book by I think it's kim scott

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:19.970
I forget her name a book called radical candor which I read and now i'm rereading

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.920
it's

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.440
Some of it's

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:31.640
Actually, it's it's very good. It's one of the best management books i've read and i'm not sure I but i'm not sure why yet

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.720
I'm trying to figure that out

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:39.400
It's maybe like when I sometimes I read sometimes I read a book it connects things I believe in and adds some more

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.100
Background to them, but it's how to give that

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.520
how

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.740
Some of it it's like tying

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:52.100
Some good frameworks for giving feedback in radical candor. It reminds me a little bit of the this

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.460
Model we call fierce feedback at unity, which is uh

00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:00.180
Sort of what's the way I remember it is what so what now what what's next?

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:06.660
And they get about the action. So I tell you you did this and it caused this action and then

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.160
We discussed before I even tell i'm not going to going to tell you right away

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:18.000
If I have ideas how to do that, i'm gonna say brent when you do this, it causes this problem

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:21.160
And then i'm gonna let you talk

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.040
I'm gonna let you lead the conversation from there. So yeah, maybe you realize it. Maybe you don't maybe have an excuse

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.320
Maybe you don't but we're gonna have a discussion about it for a while and then

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.480
when

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.360
We feel like that discussion important thing on that one

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.500
Actually is that you're discussing the employee's behavior

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:46.680
Not the employee right when you do this what it causes when you don't get your work done on time

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:51.000
It slows down the whole team from getting this getting this the this deliverable done

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.830
every human being

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:56.360
is awesome

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.320
but

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.880
in this in in the environmental context

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.480
Their behaviors in one environment

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:10.360
Maybe a winning success equation and but in another environment the exact opposite

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.840
Yeah a big difference I know of for example between

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.510
google and microsoft

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:22.950
There's google's in the news a lot and and they're being framed as sort of a utopian

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:29.590
Technology company and i'm like, yeah, you know what that's probably hyperbole, but I can see where they're coming from

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:32.390
The google model sort of rewards

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.320
similar thinking

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.560
convergence consensus

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.760
The microsoft model is significantly more competitive

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:47.800
Definitely. No your idea is stupid. It's built around that it's it's too definitely to a fault. Yeah

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.120
Well, I think they're both

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:57.400
Dysfunctional to some degree. Let me finish with what so what now what what's next and tie that back to radical candor and maybe reasons

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.520
It's overlapping. So you have this discussion about the behavior

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.160
And then at some point you go so and this could be a five minute conversation could be an hour conversation

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.560
uh

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.670
So what do we do about it?

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:14.390
And maybe maybe you have some ideas become some together. Okay, then what are the next steps?

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:16.470
Maybe it's to sync in a week. Maybe it's to

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:19.830
Let me give you an example. I'm gonna try this a radical candor and give an example

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:23.750
One of the things you want to do in feedback is give feedback

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:29.190
As close to the moment that it happened than necessary like the microsoft model is in the review

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:34.950
When you're getting your crappy performance number you go. Yeah back in january you were a dick in that meeting

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.510
And that really affected really affected the vp's view of you. So you're getting a poor score

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.470
Well, yeah

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.430
The other problem with that is of course a lot of the times

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:50.610
The consequences aren't readily apparent. Yeah, so instead

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:56.530
Uh, I can apply that and this is very much the radical candor model is give that feedback in the moment

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:02.050
Say brent when you interrupt like after a meeting we walk out of hey brent when you interrupt in a meeting it

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.610
Makes people feel like you don't care about what they have to say

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:07.910
And this is all like in a two-minute conversation

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.100
so

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.500
Next time you're in a meeting and you have and maybe we can

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.620
Depends on the people and context we can figure out a plan for that

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.980
But in that moment give that and again, these are contrived examples

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:25.700
But the moment you observe a behavior or an action that you want to correct give that correction and just

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:32.900
Hopefully you've built a culture of trust this actually ties to the pat lynchioni work on trust

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.560
Yep

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.920
So I want to have that culture of trust and respect

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:43.520
So that I can just give you that feedback and you don't take it personally go. We have good feedback and I don't have to put

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.400
Pretty flowery words around it that that

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:55.430
Lead you they don't the problem with some of these things like a lot of times managers

00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:04.020
Um will will do oh, yeah. No, I love you, but uh, my manager hates your guts. So, you know own the message, right?

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:09.460
Um, no, but the thing is I I actually agree with that portion of owning the message

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.560
because what you're saying

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.440
You're telling your employee. Oh by the way you got victimized

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.240
But it's okay. I did too

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:27.170
Great. You know what? I don't want to be victimized. Give me some feedback that allows me to

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:29.970
learn from my mistakes and and

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:34.610
Gets me puts me in control of my own destiny and prevent this from happening again

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.970
That's right the primary reason why I hate adjectives

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.770
because when when

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.050
when

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.450
You are told that you are awesome

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.880
Or you are told that you are that you suck

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.160
You you're not being communicated

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.120
What behaviors you have that are being rewarded or penalized?

00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.560
Absolutely. So you're just as in the dark except you either have more or less money

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.160
And you don't always and this is a microsoft thing too, but uh, don't always tie

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.720
feedback to

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.570
rewards

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:17.250
You think they don't always say no don't i'm i'm telling you don't

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:21.970
Microsoft and you just in your example, you just said you do you just tied it to money again

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.170
And it's it's reviewed season. So it's it's inevitable but

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:28.290
Yeah, unfortunately microsoft's not

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:36.120
Very good at that yet. It's still part of our life blood in our culture. Yeah, and right many many episodes ago. We talked about our

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.080
ways to fix that but

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.840
I don't care anymore

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.960
No, no, so um an old manager of mine who has left

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.160
Microsoft and gone to another big company

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.960
In seattle that is not amazon. I like their review model

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.880
what they do

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.220
everybody

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.620
Gets their bonus. There's no competing for bonus

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:04.550
And then the manager has discretionary spot bonus money

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.580
That he can reward throughout the entire year

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.700
As that was kick ass. Here's a couple thousand

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:14.790
so

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.790
you have people

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.390
On a continuous basis trying to deliver awesome

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.760
versus

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:29.160
Spend a whole year strategizing around. Okay. Yeah, this is how i'm gonna tear alan down to make sure and again

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.960
microsoft is very competitive and a very

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:38.200
Nepotistic the part. Is that can make that a word? Uh environment where if you

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.720
Suck up to your manager you will be rewarded

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:46.530
You can be yeah, that's right. You can be rewarded. Yeah in radical candor

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:53.490
Talks about the google review promotion model where it's not the manager's choice at all to promote someone

00:55:54.200 --> 00:56:00.520
The manager can be involved of course, but you put together a packet. It's called a I forget what it's called a

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.960
They call it a packet. Uh, it's a portfolio of your work

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:06.950
Which is reviewed by?

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:11.750
A peer group a level above the level you want to go to yep

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:15.830
And they go yay nay and if that happens great

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:19.430
if not, they get some feedback there and it's

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:26.310
And I had heard about it all of the people that they're evaluating or none or any place in between

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:33.670
Yeah, and so the quality bar I had heard about it before but reading the book reminded me of what a fair

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.310
model that is

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:38.310
It's fairer than what we're used to

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.720
But there is an update

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.720
I don't have all of the details

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.920
But much like anything else that's written word

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.600
And google contains smart people just like microsoft does

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.480
It is not an ungameable system

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.840
Every system is gameable. So with enough time and enough

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.640
Um pattern matching

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.120
Yeah, you could write your stack of things

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.040
um

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.610
that

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.130
fulfills

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:10.130
what is uh

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:18.450
Unwritten but known criteria sure and back in the day like in 15 years ago if microsoft had done this I can guarantee you

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.170
Like wrote test harness

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:25.490
Would have been on the list in test. Yeah, one of the things uh, and i'm surprised

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:32.050
Actually, if this existed 15 years ago the thing that you did where you typified everybody and created the test segments

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:37.170
That would have been used for so much evil for sure for sure. And I think that

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.720
I lost track of how many reviews this was microsoft had while I was there

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.640
but

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.760
Pretty much they last until they've been gamified by too many people and then they go to a new model

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:55.780
Yeah, and my favorite part about how microsoft does it is they go to they go to the new model

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.520
Literally two weeks after you've written the review

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.800
You know

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:09.000
A lot of times the whole surprise thing isn't something that uh, my company in my humble opinion

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:14.600
Sort of agrees with up and down the stack and i'm pretty certain that actually executives would

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.360
but it's

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.360
um, it's it's

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:23.800
Legal that's that that's putting these sort of constraints on there one of the ways to work through this

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:31.160
I'll just go through it quickly. We'll talk about this in terms of like project but a lot of um,

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.480
so safe has a model

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:40.280
Alan was telling me earlier that my amazon has the model that before you start doing a chunk of work

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.760
Write the press release announcing the completion of that work. It's an extension of bdd. Yeah, um

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.900
In my team we we go through this we have it's acceptance criteria

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:57.380
We have a process we call the definition of done and i'm like it's not done until

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:02.020
A customer can do these four things. Yep. I I don't care how it's implemented

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.060
similar thing

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:09.540
It it it works in a in a nutshell. So if in the connect

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:16.100
Or what we what micro connect is the microsoft review the name of the microsoft review process if in the review

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.180
So if you have some of these

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.500
It would work positive and negative

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.680
It works better if you have an official review process that's frequent

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.380
Because things in today's world change so fast

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.260
But you can do the same thing

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.100
I could say alan

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.700
You know what? We're gonna you're gonna be writing another connect in a few months

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.260
What I would like you to do

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:44.260
After we're done with this one is I want you to go write that connect

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.720
I want you to write up right now. Yeah

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.200
What you did?

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.880
in the next three months

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.920
Yep, I get it

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.760
that process

00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.200
As long as that person's continuously rereading it or revising it or rethinking it

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.360
right, um

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.610
That's going to help them

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:09.010
Stay on the path towards the goal

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:13.410
So it reminds me one of the things that when I was doing

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:18.690
When I was doing mentoring at microsoft, one of the things that always have my serious mentees do

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:21.670
is ones are like

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:26.090
Obsessed with career growth or interested in career growth or wanted to do some sort of transformation

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:28.970
Is I said write a paragraph?

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:31.030
that

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:35.110
That is written that someone is writing about you six months from now. How would they describe you?

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.110
How is someone describing you six months from now?

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:41.430
And I make him write that paragraph and that would be the framework of what we talked about

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:46.630
Over the next n number of sessions. It's like, how are you moving toward that? How are you becoming?

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:50.390
I want to be an accomplished author. Well, how much are you writing? So I I I

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:54.950
That model is super helpful. Uh, I I love it

01:00:55.350 --> 01:01:00.790
It reminds me of my favorite lewis carroll quote if you don't know where you're going any road will get you there

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.460
and a lot of the times with the mentees is

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.420
They don't know where they're going

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:12.780
And so you spend time and you say you you you get them to come up with their own way

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:18.340
Right the the challenge is yeah, sure. I have a lot of experience. I could sit down

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.820
I'm not your manager, but I could easily tell you where to go

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:27.350
But that's not what's helpful what's helpful is for you to learn how to control your own destiny

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:32.390
And how to align it with your business and your managers and all of those things if you don't

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.190
Employees may not think about where they want to go

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:38.710
Other than i'm just going to come to work every day and show up and do my thing

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:44.950
Right, but then those are the people who go. Well, wait a minute. I'm awesome. How come I didn't get a good review

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:50.220
Well, you know you decided to to track your career

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.980
Uh, you know very similar to a butterfly flying at the whims of the wind

01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:02.010
Sometimes the wind goes in a positive direction and sometimes the wind goes straight into the volcano

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:04.870
right if you

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:06.940
If you don't like that model

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:12.700
Quit being a butterfly. So one of the things this is probably waxing political now, but one of the things

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:17.500
I grew up with a father that got paralyzed in the vietnam war

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.880
Half of his body paralyzed he went in right handed came out left handed

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.000
he does not agree

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.880
with the ada

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.720
and

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.320
a lot of these sort of

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.080
mentalities around

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.890
protecting

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:42.660
The disabled he his philosophy is much more along the lines of yep. You got delta crappy hand of cards

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:49.370
It doesn't change what you need to do in terms of play that hand the best that you can always

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.540
so us as humans

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.980
We don't have any

01:02:54.980 --> 01:03:00.180
Control over whether or not we get victimized but being a victim is a choice

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:09.690
Absolutely, and some people are happier with that and that's fine. That's a good choice if that makes you happy if it makes you feel better

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:15.050
Having this as a label. That's fine. I'm not judging on that but but

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.740
Those choices have consequences

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.340
And a lot of times you can't have the cake and eat it too

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:28.150
Anyway, I think we can end now. All right. Hey, I am

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.790
Alan and i'm brent. We'll see you next time
