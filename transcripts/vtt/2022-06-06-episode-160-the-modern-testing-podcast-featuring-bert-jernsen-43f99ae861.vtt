00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.740
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.180
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, Agile, and anything else

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:30.300
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Oh, hey, welcome to party night at AB Testing Podcast.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:01:02.740
After a long time, listeners will know when I first met Brent,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.580
I would always change his name just to confuse people. But anyway, that's a different story.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.060
And to annoy me. You can hear more about that on episode, I don't know.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.880
Anyway, back to my question. What do you been up to? What's new? What's exciting?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.720
Well, what's exciting for me is it's that most magical time of the year.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.760
We had this conversation last time. Are you still doing reviews?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.110
Well, yeah, now we're in rewards. Ooh. Right.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.750
We're doing the same thing. Yeah.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.870
It's a little less stressful here. You know, it was. Here's the thing that was interesting.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.340
It was non-trivially stressful about a month ago when we were starting the process.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.340
Because I've had people who have, well, I'll just put it this way. There are people who have been at

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.620
Microsoft for half of a millisecond coming and going, oh, it's review time. So am I getting

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:18.990
promoted? And I have having to go through in those discussions and given the right message

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:28.030
without doing it. But all of that kind of tapered down once news has gone out that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.230
meta is doing a hiring freeze, potential layoffs. They're like, oh.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.230
Maybe I should be happy to have a job. Right.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.700
I'm holding my comments. Which is a new thing for me.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:56.350
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. So the most recent life adventure for me is going through yet again

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.350
emptiness syndrome with my oldest in an unexpected way. So listeners of this,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.790
I've known he's been out to college. He's actually graduated college.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:18.800
But last week, he moved to Indianapolis and it's so his roommates.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.320
His roommates, which are really tight. And to me, this part makes sense that for him,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.110
this he doesn't really have his next stage of life is to get into a PhD program.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.750
He didn't make it this last time around, even though he went through a bunch of interviews

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.970
and he's going to he's going to get a job there, get experience in his in his discipline.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.610
He can do that anywhere. And then staying with his roommates was a really high priority.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:59.390
And one of his roommates did get into a PhD program at the University of something near

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.520
Indianapolis. I don't actually know what universities are. But going back to me.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.960
Yeah. What about you? Right. The fact. So I when he left, it was disturbing. And

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.640
my son is one of is one of my favorite people on the planet.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.490
The end, even though he lived out in Spokane, which for those who aren't listening, it's about

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.490
depending on how fast you drive is between four to six hours.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:39.890
I was born in Spokane. I did not know that. The the fact that I can't.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.080
I he's now not longer even within driving distance had had some emotional impact.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.280
Now, I'm of course concerned with him as listeners. The podcast are where

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.980
my son is gay and in Indianapolis does not have a reputation of supporting that. So we'll.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.700
Well, I think Indiana in general, generally the larger cities are a little bit more

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.270
accepting. Well, that's what I'm going to hope for. That's what I'm going to hope for.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.780
So those are the two biggest exciting things in my life.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.460
Clement, one thing I want to touch on before I go over how important I am.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.980
I'm not is same time you're here, but I want to go back to your comment about,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.540
hey, do I get a promotion now?

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.250
One thing I do and that I do is I am my org will tell you, hopefully, is I'm hyper transparent.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.130
So I tell them like exactly how much I tell them how much budget I have.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.560
Here's how much merit is here. Much promo budget is we have.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.660
We do a promotion panel process where I explain how it works.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.980
It's a collaboration between a person and their manager who want to be promoted.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.500
They have a discussion about it if they think, yeah, you're ready for promotion.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.740
You fill out this one page, two page thing, talk listing some examples of what you've done that

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.420
correspond with our job architecture, which is familiar,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.500
like ladder levels of Microsoft or career guide, whatever it's called now.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.130
And they get some 360 feedback because we want them to be working, not just getting the work done

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.930
and having impact, but in a way that fits with the introduced values.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.170
And then an independent panel also from my org sits down, reviews the packets,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.330
ask some questions and makes a choice on whether one makes a choice,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.210
whether that person is ready for promotion, but two also provides a bunch of great feedback

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.770
for that person, either on how to be successful in the new level or what they need to do to

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.930
get there. And it's super transparent. People know how it works.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.560
And it's so it's very clear on what you need to do to get promoted. It's not like,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.920
do I get promoted? It's very clear exactly what you need to do. So there's no, there's no mystery.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.900
I, that to me reminds me of, of how I understood the Google model.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.460
Well, the difference between the Google model is Google is the manager wasn't involved.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.070
The employee could say, I feel like being promoted and they would put together their packet on their

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.710
own. I feel like the managers, and then there's the other way, the Microsoft way is traditional

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.310
way is the managers sit in the room and talk about people and they figure out who should

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.550
get promoted. This is a mixture of the both, the mixture of both. The manager's decision has

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.940
weight, but it's not all the weight and they can't sit there and try and sell. And you've

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.900
been in meetings like this because it's impossible not to where the manager who can sell their

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.570
employees the best gets more of the promotion budget. And this just takes that part of the

00:07:53.570 --> 00:08:00.370
equation out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The, just to point to a point of clarity. So Google,

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:07.170
the manager is involved, but optionally so. So to, to, to be considered for promotion,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:15.810
I either the manager or the employee can, can state I'm ready. Okay. And, and then as I understand

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:22.450
it, the way the packets are processed are in, in priority order. Obviously the ones where

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.690
both the manager and the employee, uh, believe they're ready. Go first.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.780
Okay. I haven't worked at Google. I don't know all other details, but

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.100
I don't need their, this is, this is the way we do it in my team.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:41.180
I, I like, I like the models. I like the model. The, the one thing that's nice about it

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:48.400
is the only, the only change I would do with, with yours, if, if I had the ability to

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.520
was make the committee just be outside of your org entirely. Yeah. Eventually. It's honestly,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.080
it's too, and I've involved people from outside the org. It's just too foreign of a concept for

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.360
a lot of people right now. Eventually, eventually I have to grow into that. I couldn't train,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.880
I can train my org and give them training on how to be a panel member and how to be a panel lead.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.280
I have less control over training people outside of my org, how to do that.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:25.780
Gotcha. So, but we also do for our, um, more senior positions, uh, like for example,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:33.140
I wanted to open up a high level position, uh, recently. And what I have to do is I have to

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.500
bring that to a panel outside of my org, a VPs to explain the role and why it's important for

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.900
the company that has keeps me from going, Hey, I'm going to open up a VP role or a director role.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.260
Instead. I can't just do that. I have to go through a panel process to even open a role

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.950
and all the senior senior promotions go through a similar process. Anyway, uh, that was my comment

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:59.790
there. What have I been doing? No, oh, um, normal stuff, avoiding COVID. I got my second booster

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.830
shot because I am going to, I'm traveling, I'm traveling again. I'm going to Copenhagen,

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:13.020
leaving Sunday, my first trip out of the country in over two years. Fun. Um, my passport expired

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.520
during the pandemic, but I have a new one and I remembered to sign it in everything.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:27.660
Do you have a fast path to, to passport enablement? I have not, I have never possessed a passport.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:34.380
Oh my God. You're such a stereotypical American. Really? I'm on my, I've, I've had, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:41.780
Um, oh my God. I have, I have a new passport. Get a passport and see the world.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:48.530
I would love both of the same. All right. Do that. Yeah. The, a lot of people are surprised

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.570
that I've never been to Europe. I have been outside of the United States. Don't you need

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.770
a passport like it, or at least an enhanced ID to even go to Canada now. The last time we went to

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:07.570
Canada, those rules weren't in place. Oh my God. Yeah. Do you leave Bothell? I do. I'm in Redmond

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:13.730
right now. Do you leave Bothell in Redmond? Um, for those of you away, it's all just a big blob

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:21.410
of suburbia and East side. I, I was in Seattle getting Krispy Kreme just, just last weekend.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:26.930
That's fantastic. All right. So anyway, I'm looking forward to that. Should be fun.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:32.290
Just hanging out with the team there. You know, I added 50 plus people to my org in Copenhagen

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:37.410
six months ago. I have met about five of those people in person in my life and none since I

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.740
started. So I'm looking forward to hanging out with them. So that'll be fun. All right.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.180
I got a, I kind of a, because it's been a long time. I got a little bit of a

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.340
potpourri of topics on the agenda. And what are we at? Did I press record? I did. I remember how

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:58.100
to do this. We're about 12 minutes in and 10 after editing. And we're getting to stuff that,

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.860
I don't know, this is, this is going to be fun, but a little bit of a throwaway. So first,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:08.900
I would like to point out that practice test just published a list of their favorite podcasts.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:16.660
Did you know this? I did. And you know, which one is, you know, there's a bunch of podcasts on here,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:23.860
but also one called AB testing. I'm familiar with this one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the link there.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.860
And we talk, we both talk about, we're asked independently or we answered independently on

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:33.220
our favorite episode. And of course it was episode 67, the traditional versus modern testing manager.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.380
And so if you, that's what you should go check out. If you don't know what modern testing is,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.100
you don't know what you guys do. And I would go check that one out. You probably wouldn't

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:48.020
say it that way, but yeah. I would hope not. I mean, it's more cohesive. They have a great list

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:57.060
on here. I was going through and I'm like, okay, who are the, uh, who, you know, number one,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:03.380
what's the sword order? Normally we're number one because we're, we start with A, but this is not

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:12.740
where we're listed in number three. I do think in terms of adding awesome, colorful stories.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:20.100
Oh yeah. Interesting. It's actually you, me, and Joel. We're the only ones that sort of added

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:26.180
stories to, to, um, to their list there. I don't know, but it's the whole list of things you can

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.380
go check out. It's a good way to sample and see if there are undoubtedly better testing podcasts.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:38.770
Undoubtedly. Right. And what, what's funny is we're on this list, but our podcast really,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.560
I guess we talk about testing, but it's not a testing's in the title and we've been testers,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.960
but we talk about a lot of other stuff, but today we're going to talk about testing.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:14:00.510
Let's talk about AB testing with the slash, which is a, uh, yeah, it's right up your alley

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:06.910
cause AB testing with the slash of course, about compare experimentation and comparing different

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.310
treatments. And it's all out of Eric Ries and something that I know a little bit about. I

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:18.030
give him some talks about, but I would think a data scientist is far, far more knowledgeable

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:24.270
in this area than I would be as much as I, you know, I try and I try and learn what I can, but

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:30.990
I think Brent, would you agree with me that you between us, you are the expert in a slash B testing?

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:38.830
Oh, absolutely not. Well, you would be right. Because if you look at the list of, uh, from,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:45.870
uh, KELOLAND.com of 58 influencers and AB testing, you need to know in 2022,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.420
my name shows up, not yours. Yeah.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:15:02.850
It's interesting and it's interesting because it seemed like, uh, I don't, I don't know who wrote

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:08.690
this harder. No, me neither. I suspect the next girlfriend of Allen's or something there.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:16.690
Gets better. It gets better. I'm in a section of, I'm in the section of AB testing influencers

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:22.610
in feature management. I don't know what that means, but you're the only one there.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:29.810
Oh, you're right. Yeah. I don't know what it means either. I don't know any of this. I don't,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:35.810
the world doesn't make sense, but I wanted to call it out. In terms of like the category,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:43.490
well, feature management, to me, it looks like they, they might've done a LinkedIn search on

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:50.130
AB tests and looking for, looking for executives. Oh, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, maybe, maybe.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:58.770
I don't get those anymore. I took, I took, I think I took advice from you on that years ago is basically

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:07.070
right. You change certain keywords in your profile and now you no longer show up in that,

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:13.310
in their search engine. Yeah. Recruiters don't actually read. They just keyword searched your

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:18.190
profile and they go, Ooh, S debt. And I was an S debt a long time ago. I want to come back to

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.430
S step, but do you know who else is a VP of engineering that we both know?

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.140
I know several people that we both know that are VPs of engineering.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.820
That was a dumb question. Yeah. But before, before we move on,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:42.770
Oh, okay. Like I, I'm, I'm looking at this, uh, this, this highly suspicious list of AB testing

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:50.450
influencers. The one that includes me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was, um, and it explicitly

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:56.690
mentions that you are now hosting the modern testing podcast. Apparently. So when did that,

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:04.050
when did that start? I don't know, man. I think for Brent, for Brent's, the also ran. It's like,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.050
yeah, it's, it's, it's the Allen's podcast. Welcome. This is the Allen page podcast with

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:17.340
a special guest this week, Burt Jensen. Yeah. You know, one day, uh, when I get tired of your

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:22.700
bullshit, dude, I did not like, do you see my byline there? I didn't make that page. Somebody

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.900
else screwed it up. No, I'm just going to tease you for it incessantly. It just occurred to me

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:34.860
that like the name of the podcast is AB testing. Right. And if you just erase that small little

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:41.600
bump in B, it very quickly becomes AP testing. That may or may not have already happened.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.500
All right. I'm, I'm now searching Spotify for the modern testing podcast.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:55.180
All right. We may have a discussion later. Is it called them? That's so funny. They call it

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:01.180
that the modern testing podcast. They called it the modern testing podcast. Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:09.470
I just, I don't, I don't know why people even make these lists. Some, some, I don't know. Anyway,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:18.620
uh, back, back, so check fail. So a long time ago, modern testing

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:27.100
podcast. Nope. Nothing on Spotify. So you don't, you're not hosting it there yet. All right. I'll

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:34.700
find it. Mr. Page. Wouldn't it be funny if you found it. Oh my God. Alan has a podcast. It's like

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.540
totally produced like those ones with like the sound effects and the music in the background.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.180
It'd be like this American life, but it's a modern testing podcast. Oh, I can weave some

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:48.780
stories together. Oh, it'd be so good. That's such a good idea that I don't have time to implement.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:56.050
Now you had to hire people for that. All right. All right. Oh, remember, remember that

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:01.890
one time I wrote a book about software testing. I do. And I didn't write at all. I wrote most of it

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.690
and I take damn, I was damn clear with this. I counted pages and how many I wrote and I wrote

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:12.210
most of it. BJ Ralison wrote part of it. I don't know what ever happened to BJ. I did look him up.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.410
I did a Google search. He did like, he like sailed his boat to Hawaii and then Fiji during COVID.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:25.300
But the other author who wrote two chapters, one chapter on, uh, one chapter actually interesting

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:31.140
on like where the term S debt came from. Like, you know, how that was invented at Microsoft.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.660
And some of the stuff around some of the history of tests is actually still accurate,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.900
even though it's changed so much since then the snapshot's accurate. But he wrote another chapter

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:47.940
on, uh, I don't know. I don't think it was even called service testing, something around how we

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.900
were testing services at the time. And he, within a year, he was so embarrassed about that

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.780
chapter and how horribly out of date it was. He was writing that at a time. Microsoft was still

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:04.420
figuring out how to do service testing. But anyway, BJ, of course, left, uh, Microsoft a long time

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:10.770
ago. I left five years ago, five and a half years ago. And as of last week, Ken Johnston has left

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:17.490
Microsoft. No more authors are left. He is now the VP of AVP of engineering at Ford motor company.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:25.650
Yeah. He sent me a message on linked in recruiting you. He needs data scientists.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:33.820
He told me initially, it looks like on LinkedIn, his title is different. Right. But he, um,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:42.620
he's the director of data platforms and analytics for the EV division. That's, oh, no, he's, he's VP.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:49.100
Our listeners can hear anyway. Anyway, I'm just, just saying like, look right here.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:56.930
Ken telling me that's his title. Um, look at the, look to the left where it says I'm happy to share

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.890
that I'm starting a new position as VP engineering at four voter company. Yeah. No, I see that.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:08.990
Right. I'm just telling you, I don't, I don't, can tell me this is his title. Okay. He fold.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:15.790
He's told everybody, this is his title. I don't know what it is. So Ken's a big fat liar. That's

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:21.710
what you're going to share your screen on an audio podcast. Ken's a big freaking liar.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:29.630
No, I just say, I'm basically saying, is that your power move? Ken is an executive at Ford.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:35.150
And, um, there you go. What ifs, what ifs, um, I hope he does cool stuff. He's really,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.590
super excited about it. All right, man. So anyway, Ken went there. So all those authors are gone.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:47.470
The book is blah, blah, blah. I got a couple of questions for you. Yes. So I love ministry

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:55.730
of testing because, uh, for many, many, many, many reasons, uh, one is like a couple of every day,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:02.610
they are awesome. They asked some questions on Twitter that get a variety of answers depending

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:08.750
on who answers them. So I'm going to ask you a couple of days. I'll give you the answer I gave

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.870
on Twitter. Don't look at Twitter right now. So I'm going to ask you this. What's the most

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:29.010
common cause of failed automated tests in your experience? Uh, crappy automation code. Well,

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:41.070
with, um, I just wrote code. Sure. Which one it was either people or code. I didn't want to

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:50.910
blame people. So I, I wrote code. Um, yeah, you can't the way, the way I would frame it is more.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:59.700
Yeah, there are better answers out there. People writing automation code under the

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:10.140
false assumption. It's easy and learning the hard way it's not right. Quite honestly,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:18.990
yet sure. Sometimes things change and that causes things to break, but that's not a failed

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:26.910
automation test that say automation test that failed subtle difference. And the wordings were

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:33.090
there too. Cause is it failed? They mean flaky failed. Does it mean the product under test failed?

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:38.050
I don't know how to answer that, but it was, I copied that to share that with you because

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.530
that was interesting question. There was one yesterday equally interesting for different

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.650
reasons. And as you can imagine a variety of answers, I'm going to throw at you also.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:55.390
Does a market shift towards S debts concern you? Yes. Me too. And mainly because I wonder

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:02.830
how this tweet from 24 2004 got into my timeline as a new tweet yesterday.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:15.200
Oh, that's fun. No, it was tweeted yesterday. And I think it's weird. To me, maybe it's because we're so

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.740
into the modern testing world, right? I just, you know, there's a bubble I live in where I think

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.620
Estes are still a thing, which was my, actually my answer.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:31.440
Yeah. What does that mean to you? Like, like, well, so it, it means possibly two things.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:39.200
Great. So in my career here, I've noticed that things kind of seem to circle around again,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:49.840
around every 10 years ish. Right. Where, um, I've often noticed, and you may have noticed this as

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:57.250
well with, with, uh, let's say let's take the topic of duplication of effort where, where you'll

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:05.810
see teams go duplication of effort is bad. And, and then they try to centralize it under one

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:16.370
leadership and one mission and everybody's going to benefit from this. And then that central team

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:23.890
eventually becomes a bottleneck and they're only able to provide the 80% solution for everybody,

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:31.010
which there's where everyone then has to make their own 20% and they don't have the ability to do it

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:36.690
on that platform in which that encourages a decentralization. And I constantly see that

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:50.140
pendulum swinging back and forth on this. If assets are coming back, uh, I hope it's because

00:25:51.340 --> 00:26:00.220
we're now going into a new realm of complexity where, where it's just not possible to develop in

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.260
and test in parallel. If it's that's, that's not it. And I'm going to interrupt because what I think

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:12.740
is actually happening is every once in a while, when I think it helps see the bubble. We've talked

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:18.100
about viewing where modern testing is as the change of innovation curve. And I forget, it really

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:25.470
has a lot of companies that are still hiring a good number of Estes or which want to go back

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.830
in time. Just like somebody wants to go back in time and save JFK. I want to go back in time to

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:36.430
that meeting of the test leadership team at Microsoft and just not, just not use that term

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:41.230
and get it erased from history. But what they want, they're hiring people to write a bunch of

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:48.110
gooey automated tests because they can write code and what that means. Wait, wait, wait, pause.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:55.090
That question was in context of what you just stated. I don't understand the question. The

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.890
question was, does the market shift towards Estes concern you? And you're saying that the

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:07.010
context in which that question was raised was around UI automation?

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.240
Well, it's unclear. Some of the answers were around that. Some of the answers were around that.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.790
And I think a lot of companies are still hiring test automation specialists, calling them Estes.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.990
That was my takeaway from the answers and that concerns me.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:27.680
Okay. So what that tells me, and here's the big concern. I think you and I, and well before

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.320
modern testing, Agile testing was around talking about whole team ownership of quality and we're

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:40.720
all part of the team. What hiring Estes means is more silos because you probably have manual testers,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.560
your automated testers or Estes, and then developers who don't have to write tests.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:51.520
Even though we know and the data's out there showing that if the developers write the automated

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:58.880
tests themselves, there's a higher correlation of quality in their organization. So in fact,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:05.120
you're hiring Estes, you are setting yourselves up to some extent, at least for lower quality.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:14.960
By hiring Estes based off of studies such as the one that you decided, by hiring Estes,

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.540
you are actually harming yourself. That's my belief. That's my belief.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.260
I share that belief. Well, you're no fun to argue with.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:33.740
No, how else are we going to parallelize? Let's quickly redo episode 67.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.140
No.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:43.580
Yeah, that's, so you had a small sample set and right now I'm just going to choose to believe

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:52.700
that the vocal minority in the world that died is the one that contributed to the Q&A of that.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.380
Or are you saying these are active ministry of test people?

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.540
Well, I mean, it's whoever's on Twitter. They asked, the thing I love about them,

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.380
they asked these questions knowing they're going to get a variety of answers.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.700
Yeah, that part I love that's fun. The random questions and

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:17.420
things like the MT has shown up or modern testing principles has shown up on there,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:26.820
I think more than a couple of times. I love that they are spawning conversation.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.900
Yeah, they are. And they know they're going to get debate in a different set of answers.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.620
And good conversations happen. And it's, yeah, I'm actually really happy with it.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.300
Look back at the thread because people are answering in different ways. There's the whole,

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:45.140
well, I'm a manual tester and I don't want my, I don't feel like I have to program. And it's, we,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:52.980
all those conversations go away. If we, if we really embrace whole team quality and look at

00:29:52.980 --> 00:30:00.420
whether you're entirely a non-coding tester or a tester who writes lots of code, there are

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:07.390
valuable ways for you to contribute to quality on your team. But the developers should be writing

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:15.340
the test automation. If you're like, if I'm a, if I say I'm hired as an SDET, but I'm hired as an SDET,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.020
I wouldn't be hired as an SDET, maybe hired as a developer, developer and test. I'll say I'm

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.740
hired as an SDET on a team where developers are writing a whole lot of automated tests,

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.220
not just their stupid little unit tests. They're writing actual functional tests and they're doing

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:33.020
a pretty good job of testing. I'm spending some of my time probably teaching them to write better

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:38.380
tests because who wants, who wants flaky tests? And I know I have some good ideas how to not do that,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:44.540
but maybe I'm also looking at writing analysis tools or tools that will help me put the application

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.860
in a state, right? Where, whether it's a stress test or put it in a state where some weird things

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:55.260
may happen or diagnostic tools or linking in the telemetry from the app and some other analytics

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.740
tools. Those are the sorts of things I want to do as an SDET. I don't want to just automate

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.860
a bunch of GUI operations. And that's what I, that's what I fear. And what I observed in some

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:11.100
cases happening in some of these orgs. And I, I wish we could just move past it. And again,

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.940
it's the siloing, the siloing doesn't work. And you and I have lived through this at Microsoft where

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:21.420
we had a huge functional dev org and a huge fun functional test org. And that conflict between

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:28.060
developers and testers that we thought was kind of cool 20 years ago is unproductive today.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:36.080
So the only way I can think of why a customer, a company would do this, right? Would be

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:44.400
because they could hire people to do automation, potentially at a much lower pay scale.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.160
Maybe, maybe not everybody has embraced this, this style of software development. I even call it

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.480
testing because remember modern testing isn't really about testing and it's not that modern

00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:01.760
either. It's just, just the antidote to traditional test late test last, conflictual siloed

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.640
testing that we had seen coming up in software in the nineties and two thousands.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:13.980
Yeah. I wonder if ministry of tests even has any data on this.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.740
No, I mean, again, I, I, yeah, there's value. I did. They teach test automation course,

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.180
think it's valuable and people still need to learn that stuff and it'll need to for a while.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:29.980
But when I see some answers to these questions, I go, wow, my bubble is smaller than I thought.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.620
And sometimes I think my bubble turns out to be bigger than I thought. I, people come up and say,

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.500
oh, Hey, thanks for putting the name to what we've already been doing. Or,

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:43.260
you know, we're following these principles. I go, Oh, okay, great. And sometimes I see some answers

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.860
go, Oh, the bubbles, I can't tell how big the bubble is and where things are on the curve.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:51.500
Sometimes I'm constantly sort of probing and checking in on that as well.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.700
And I'll just tell you right now, I obviously like you, I don't have proof,

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:04.500
but the number of conversations and the number of insight, like, I think we talked about it the

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:10.340
other, the other day, we're mainstream now. We're not, we're no longer sort of leading

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:17.780
right. The, the, the change curve that, that you've put it multiple times in your presentation.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:23.460
We're no longer part, MTP is no longer really part of the leading edge. It's more mainstream.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.460
Yeah. It's on, it's on the downward power of that curve. It's in, we're past the,

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:36.290
yeah, yeah. Anyway, go on. No, it's, we're at a point where it's well duh, right? Because it's

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:45.330
just so commonplace. I think, I think more of the traditionalist point of view is actually on its

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:53.410
way out. But I think there's enough of us in the industry. That maybe what's happening actually.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:34:03.810
There was a, do you remember the QA series you did in partnership with an external organization?

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:10.050
I think they were a contract agency. Michael Hunter presented a presentation there. They were like,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.980
they hosted it and they were in like downtown Bellevue.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.260
Talking about Sasquatch. Yes. Seattle, are you a software quality assurance group?

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.700
Yes. And actually less, less, I think it was the one that did the presentation. Now I think

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:31.100
about it. You brought him in, you brought him into, no, Lee Lee, you brought him into Microsoft.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:36.940
And he, he, his presentation was around, I think he called it the 10 great for giddings.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:41.900
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm wondering if that's what's happening again. Like we've been

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:48.800
that people are considering assets and think it's new. I wonder if that's what's happening.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:55.280
Oh, I wonder. I wonder. And there's not enough people around that remember the old days now

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:06.260
to go, Oh dear God. No, no, stop. No, no, stop. Anyway, I don't know. It does bother me.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:15.860
Uh, I think which the points of the question, uh, and I dearly hope M O T does not have any

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:24.020
data that points towards this. Although Joel probably would, would have the data.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:28.260
I love that Joel calls out like, you know, what kind of testing do you and MT is one of the things.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:35.060
Um, I want to, uh, change subjects completely, which will mean we either have a three minute

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.780
conversation or a 15 minute conversation on something I've been thinking about a lot.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.500
I want to bounce off you, but really I'm bouncing it off of our listeners.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:48.260
You know, yeah. Is that cool? Then it is that, or ask you some IST QB interview questions.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.740
So I'm going to skip that part this week. I've been, uh, of course, as you know, at unity,

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:58.580
I manage a bunch of stuff, including whatever you want to call our infrastructure or platform,

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:04.980
et cetera, team, the team that builds all of the infrastructure and tools we need in order to,

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:10.100
build, test, deploy, maintain our products in production, whether it's desktop apps,

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.980
service apps, I think people know that some of the traditional names are internal platform, et cetera.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.430
One thing I have a part of my team, uh, doesn't matter what they're currently called,

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:30.130
but their purpose is interesting. Their purpose is to focus on helping teams internally use our

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:37.180
tools. So enablement, advocacy, awareness, developing training, um, some internal community

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:44.690
management, et cetera. And two things, uh, and this could go anywhere, but what I've found is

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:48.210
kind of like when people, this is cool. You know, when people, this is a good segue.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.010
If I would have thought it this apart farther in advance, thought I had planning,

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.610
this was one of those podcasts knew what the sound effects like, like the modern testing

00:36:54.610 --> 00:37:03.650
podcast. Uh, you would, um, I would have wove this in much better, but people contact me frequently

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:08.690
and say, thanks for putting a name to something we're already doing. Didn't know what it was called.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:17.010
Recently, I had one of those moments myself when I realized there is a name for what this team

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:23.410
does. And I don't know if a lot of companies have a team called developer relations whose job is to

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:28.610
do this, you know, basically make sure, work with customers to make sure they understand how

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:34.450
to use your API and how to use your tools, et cetera. There is a whole bunch of writing on the

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:41.730
internet about a thing called internal developer relations, which exactly describes what one of my

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:47.090
organizations does, which is everything I just said, engagement, developer experience,

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:54.530
enablement awareness. They're doing communication and classes and brown bags and working directly

00:37:54.530 --> 00:38:00.290
with teams and sort of a consulting role, like a test coaching sometimes, or actually test coaching,

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:08.820
working with teams to make sure they're successful using all the rest of the stuff my org builds.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.060
And the question is, when I look at that, you know, now I'm like thinking,

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.700
where have I seen this before? And right before I left Microsoft, when did I leave Microsoft?

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.100
2017. So a couple of years before I left, I don't know if it's still a thing at Microsoft,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.660
but they had a thing called one ES, one engineering system out of the VS team

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.900
to try and again, Microsoft isn't on one engineering system, but you know,

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:38.740
they all use Git now, I think most teams use visual studio team system. Oh, I'm sorry.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:44.580
Azure DevOps, another dumb ass name. So some of us there, but what do you remember about

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.380
one ES? Is that still a thing people talk about at Microsoft?

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:56.340
It's still there. One ES in the concept that you're referring to is, I would say is not

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:05.840
really talked about, but it's still the spirit behind it is still moving forward.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:14.690
Right. It's just Microsoft is huge. Right. The for a long period of time. I mean,

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:24.220
hell, we've talked about it before. In terms of what the hell were those things called?

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:31.980
The career stage profiles. But even then before, right, the things that you, you, Alan Page,

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:38.860
helped to author. It used to have crappy things like it in order to get to principle and test.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:44.460
You had to architect a test. I didn't work. I worked on the old, the newer version,

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.220
the old version said like, and again, it wasn't a checklist. It was a horrible

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.380
architecture and those things are challenging. I could talk, I could do a podcast talking about

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:57.100
those things, but yeah, it didn't, but there were, they were individual accomplishment over

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:05.890
efficiency and in it together. It encouraged individual accomplishment over company

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:14.930
accomplishment. Yeah. Quite honestly. Yep. I fully agree. And that definitely is changing

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:21.090
under under Satya. Yeah. And to be fair, it was Satya who kicked off. It was one ES was his idea

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:25.490
to try and bring some consolidation to give the idea of the landscape back then. Let me get

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:31.250
Microsoft was even huge. They're bigger now, but every team had a different way of building,

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:35.890
deploying and testing and even tracking bugs for their stuff. It was just a big fat mess.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:43.260
There is in various different places in the company. So earlier I mentioned sort of this

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:50.300
tendency to, to shift back and forth between centralization and decentralization. And I would

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:59.490
say right now we are, at least in the group I'm in, there is a shift towards centralizing again.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:09.540
I don't know. I'll just tell you, I will help. I will contribute and collaborate. I am not yet

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:19.060
bought into the vision and I hope the leaders there convinced me otherwise because on the face

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:28.580
of it, it feels like there is a, there is a, there's a committee that's going through and trying to define

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:39.060
the set of standards that will cause everyone to standardize. And, and I'm like,

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:46.350
you can't make those things. Every business will require you to change your standard.

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:50.830
You have to have a way to handle that. And that's a huge scale. Let me talk about how I'm doing that

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:59.470
at my scale because I, we really believe in autonomy and letting people and giving people

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:05.310
choices. So, but in some cases we can't do that. In some cases around like security tooling that we

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:10.910
implement, we're going to be very strict about that. The way I look at it is providing paved

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:17.180
roads. And you're going to, if you want to get the absolute best support from my team and have your

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.960
best chance for success, you're going to stay on those paved roads. But sometimes you need to

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.440
go onto a dirt road and it's fine. It's probably, it's probably still going to be okay. A lot of that

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.200
dirt road comes back, connects to a paved road, but you're going to get a little less support

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.440
from us because we don't want to support you there. If you're going to be all off mountain biking in

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:41.520
the wilderness, you are on your own and nobody's, no exec business is going to support that. They're

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.400
going to say, if you want to run a service, you stay as much as you can on the paved roads that

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.140
are already provided. That's how you're going to be successful. And so it's not, so you may get a

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.820
couple of different things. For example, you maybe, for example, you could use, I don't even name

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:02.460
any names. There's a couple of different CI systems you could use. You could use a couple

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:07.100
of different public cloud providers and we'll help you with those. But generally the paved roads are,

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:13.340
are, we want to, again, the metaphor is getting burned out here, but I want to give people a

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:20.580
chance, give them a chance to choose where needed, but I can't just let them go wide open, willy

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:25.060
nilly, whatever you want, because eventually you're going to need support from my team and

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.100
you're not going to be able to get it because we don't know what you're doing.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:34.340
Well, yeah. And if you can, if you can put constraints around that or principles,

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:41.300
to me, the, the solution to this is establishing the right set of principles that, that serve

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:47.860
as guardrails. Right. Guardrails. We want to help people stumble towards success. The other thing

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.580
is again, easier to do with a company of 5,000 than it is 200,000. I don't know if that

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:58.020
translates into engineers, but there's a level of trust I need to establish with the

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:06.900
business leaders, neither organizations where they come. Like I have one leader for a big org.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:13.410
He tells me, tell my team what to do. He wants us to tell him what to do.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.570
Go wash my car.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:19.730
You know what I mean? It's like we can, we can say do X like, okay,

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:24.210
we're going to do X, but usually it's here's what we've learned from this analysis and looking at

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:29.170
these incidents going forward. We should always do X and they go, okay, it's canon. It's done.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:35.680
We're doing it. And those things just turn into the paved roads. I don't know how.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:42.050
Well, first of all, again, I think this is very difficult at Microsoft. I think to some extent,

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.810
the Azure DevOps team probably does this internally. One thing I was really impressed

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:51.810
with is it is very, very difficult to take a product that's shipped both internally and

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:56.130
externally. And I have been talking to VS folks about this for a long time. They said, nope,

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:01.170
Microsoft employees, not our customers. And eventually Satya said, yes, they are.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:04.050
And it is a difficult thing to do. When I think of companies that have

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:11.090
something they use internally, they ship externally, it's almost always a forked version

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:17.170
more often two different teams working on those things. So full credit to that Azure DevOps team,

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:21.490
despite their dumb name, figuring out how to deliver to both internal and external customers.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:26.690
So that part is great. And I know they probably have a team that kind of functions as internal

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:31.730
developer relations. I know I would get pinged a lot when I was there by I didn't look up to see

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.570
who they were. People on that team to say, how's this going? I see you're doing an

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:38.770
inordinate number of queries against this data set. What's up? And I explained,

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:43.170
I built a dashboard. They go, okay, that's cool. But I'm kind of wondering,

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:48.290
this is very similar to someone else's journey into modern testing. They go, oh,

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:53.730
this is the thing I already do. I can read about it a little bit. How often is this?

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.410
How often is this used? So what I'm curious about from our listeners, and you can go to the

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:01.330
one of the three dot slack dot com or get an invitation from modern testing dot org,

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:07.330
if not already there. And I'm just curious if you have a team like this, if you call them

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:12.770
internal developer relations, or if you don't, that's fine too. But does your company have

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:18.850
a team whose role is to evangelize sort of a central set of tools? And then I wonder,

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:25.460
while I ask this question, if your company is 100 people, you probably don't need that,

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:30.420
because everybody knows everybody. And there's no need to do that. They know about stuff. There's

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:38.050
some tipping point where one or two degrees of separation are so prevalent that you need

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:44.960
to have a team to help make sure that people know how to use the dozens of thought, hundreds

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.680
of different things that we have to help developers get their job done. So very curious.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:57.700
So I know they haven't been engaged with me if they exist. But as you correctly call out,

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:11.120
a lot of within Microsoft is now public. One thing we are about to do, which I think you've been doing

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:18.960
this for a while, back in the day, when you join a new team, right? What's one of the first conversations

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:24.830
you had with your admin? Do you remember? You're about to join a team. They always ask you,

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:31.230
okay, you probably forgot. One of the first conversations is which machine you're taking

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:38.190
with you. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. The laptop or the desktop? Well, I forgot. Yeah,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:48.960
I would never would have pulled that. We are about to remove desktop from active life here.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:54.720
Yeah. In the world. Yeah. We just have laptops.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:01.840
It'll start with Azure, but then it'll go to it'll go to all of Microsoft pretty quick.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.120
What's interesting, I'll see if I can start the story real quick, but early on in the pandemic,

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:12.000
what was interesting is the our desktop developers were a little slow at first because their

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.880
desktops were stuck at work. They needed to either VPN into them or get them and bring them

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:22.560
home. But on the services side of things, it was business as normal because we do all our work

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.360
on laptops and all the heavy lifting happens in the cloud. Right. Right. And honestly,

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:35.070
that last plug, my M1 MacBook Pro is faster than my desktop. It's a my desktop is fast.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:42.110
It's a rocket. Anyway, go on. I am beginning to go into a market. So I don't know if you've

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:50.110
encountered this as well. Maybe your glasses are better than mine. I find that as I'm getting

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:56.110
older, my eyesight is getting worse. I have a piece of shit laptop right there on the ground,

00:48:56.110 --> 00:49:02.430
which you can't see with a 14 inch screen, which I just can't work from anymore.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:08.910
I have to I am at the age where the resolutions I run out, I need glasses to use.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:18.750
Even with glasses, I will get a headache. Oh, or I have to blow up the resolution so much that

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:26.030
all I can see is like the text box that says your first name. Right. And I'm like, yeah,

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:33.310
now give me my monitors at work with Dolmon. And when I heard about us moving to the cloud

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:39.150
with virtual desktops, I'm like, okay, that makes sense. Right. And dog food. I've always been a

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:47.520
believer in dog food. But I don't want to give up multi-mon. Multi-mon super handy for me.

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.480
And it turns out it works. I'm running three monitors on my laptop. Well,

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:57.360
can I have the laptop plus two other monitors? Yes. Yeah. So we're going to get apparently

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:05.220
workstation class laptops. I don't know what that means. It's a good plan. And honestly,

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.580
that whole you can take one machine thing was dumb because those machines

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.420
half the time didn't end up going just end up sitting around doing nothing anyway.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:23.900
Oh, not me. My, my last machine, the machine I took with me to Azure was like an 80 gig box.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:32.060
I had, wooed the admin to allow me to buy the memory for it. And people are like,

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:40.460
how much memory is in this thing? And I'm like, a lot, but now with the cloud, I'm like,

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:46.620
80 gigs. Anyway, I got to get going. We're talking to the old guy talkbook and I love to hear the

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:52.140
chatter on this in our stock channel. So bring that on. I got to run. And, but it's been good

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:59.340
chatting with you again. Yes. See you in a couple of weeks. All right, man. Bye. Bye.
