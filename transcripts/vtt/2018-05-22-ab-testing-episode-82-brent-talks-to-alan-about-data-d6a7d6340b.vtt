WEBVTT

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.680
Hey everyone. Howdy. I'm Alan. I am Brent. And we're back again for AB testing.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.960
Episode 82. 82. And AB testing is a podcast. It is. Because yes, you could tell because

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.800
you're listening to it in your podcast player. Right. And that's pretty much the only reason

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.920
why. What kind of podcast is it, Brent? Oh, you're going to make me make up the thing now.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.820
The AB stands for Alan and Brent. I am a test director, long time tester, both long time testers.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.980
Brent is now a principal data scientist at Microsoft. And we get together every couple

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.020
weeks and we talk about testing sometimes. Agile software, software development,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.660
software engineering in general, change management, leadership management. And

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.260
recently for the last several episodes, this thing we have called Modern Testing.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.140
And we have a set of principles on moderntesting.org. And you can read through those and then send us

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.380
angry tweets and emails and tell us you don't like them or you love them as we get both.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:29.760
Yes. We have gone through the transition at Microsoft of going through and sort of

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.160
drastically reducing test specialists. We've gone different directions. One of the things that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:49.310
binds this podcast together is that we're strong believers in quality. And we don't necessarily think

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.750
that the testing activity, the way it's been done in the past, directly contributes to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:07.490
quality in today's world. So part of the podcast is sharing those insights and helping others to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.370
understand what we've learned. So in a way, I think we like to think, I gotta think about

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:21.890
that sentence now. I think we like to think that we are on the edge of where software testing,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.970
software engineering is kind of pushing beyond where a lot of teams are, maybe not even beyond

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.610
in some cases. In fact, I'm sure there are at least some listeners, some of our three listeners,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.090
because we only have three, who think, yeah, old news done that. I've been doing that for five

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.410
years. But for a lot of people, it's like, oh, I don't know about that. And then for a lot of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.730
other people, that's exactly what I'm doing. I don't know that we're on the edge. Like what

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.610
Alan and I, when we went through this, one of the conversations we had a lot with others,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.810
as well as with each other, is around Microsoft not being a leader in this transition, but a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.610
follower. But the thing is, I actually think our listeners, I don't think we have too many listeners

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.840
that are in that ahead of Microsoft place. I don't think what we, I think we do. We may.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.260
But I think the dominant of our listeners are folks who see that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.300
transition that Microsoft's already gone through on their way.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.740
I don't think, and maybe it's me checking my bags at the door, but I don't think it's,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.320
I don't see companies trying to follow Microsoft's engineering practices much,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.720
nearly as much anymore as they did a decade or more ago.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.280
That isn't necessarily what I'm trying to say. I mean, I don't think they're playing

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.960
father to the leader with Microsoft, but I think they're concluding much of the same

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.200
things that Microsoft did at that time.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.680
Okay. All right. I'll buy that. So last time we did a deep dive into the first

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.060
modern testing principle and-

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.620
Ish.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.140
Ish. And we'll talk-

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.020
Once we got to it.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.140
Once we got to it, yeah. And this time we were going to dive into modern testing principle number

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.580
two, and now a lot of people are mad and turning it off going, what? So I wanted to take a few

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:27.300
minutes if it's okay to reflect on what we learned from the feedback from the last episode,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.580
delve a little bit into that. And then actually I have a totally tangential question for

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:42.540
Brent around data and data collection and being data driven that I thought we could discuss on air

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.580
because I thought it may be a good on air, like for live on the podcast, because I thought it would

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.150
be good for others who may be in a similar situation to understand my questions and kind of

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.190
listening on how we get to some actionable takeaways.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.510
Yeah.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:07.020
All right. So what was some of the feedback you saw from the last episode that resonated or

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.940
how would you characterize the feedback we received?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.330
Well, first off, before answering that question, let me answer the question I wish you would ask me.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.970
Oh.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.290
Yeah.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.850
You're still made up.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:33.820
Yeah. I have to say, like the Slack channel is really a useful resource.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.180
And that's one of the three.slack.com. Go to angryweasel.com, whackABtesting,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.500
and there's a link you can join straight away.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:51.550
I like very much that the discourse on the Slack channel is open, transparent,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.980
and not overtly critical. Like I've yet to observe anyone on the Slack channel

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:10.260
ask a quote unquote dumb question and then have the other listeners come back and say something

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.200
offensive. I like that that is sort of a pursuit of what's right.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.800
Let me build on that.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.280
Since adding the link to join versus send me an email to join, which adds some internet anonymity

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.720
to the process, we're getting a lot more diverse sets of opinions on the Slack team as well.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.250
If you totally don't agree with us, I think totally join the Slack channel and

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.690
start those discussions because that's how we all learn.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.700
Maybe it could be we're all wrong.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:55.950
There's several interesting discourses since episode 81 going on where we see exactly that.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:09.090
One of my favorite questions is, hey, there doesn't seem to be a lot of testing going on in

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.050
modern testing, to which my statement is right.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.970
Yeah, but it's good to call that out because we didn't call that out directly.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.970
But that was, I think I answered that one first, said something about that and you plus one dip.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:35.380
But there is nuance that we, I guess, internally take for granted or just didn't verbally say

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.500
that are actually really good points about the principle. So that feedback is super valuable.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:48.860
And by the way, worth a plug here. Ministry of Testing made a poster out of our principles and

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:56.060
even had, I thought someone obviously went back and rewatched my test bash talk, wrote up a little

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.940
explanation of each principle below it for the poster.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.460
And they did a fantastic job with it.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.500
I thought they did a really good job.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:08.540
Like, hey, wait a minute. We just plotted out the content for the next seven episodes.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.900
At least at this range, if we have to get that deep dive discussion about the deep dive,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.380
it actually may go on that way. It may be 14 episodes.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.740
Yeah, the one thing I think is an issue, the one thing actually when I first saw it,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:33.280
and they did a fantastic job, but then I felt a little guilt slash concerned because I'm like,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.600
well, what happens if we change the principle?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.600
Well, at this stage, I think it's tweaking. I think we can make things,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.750
like we tweaked the one around, I forget, we did a lot of tweaking between there,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.550
a ton of tweaking between the original set and this set.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.830
I think we'll continue to tweak at this stage.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.990
I don't know if we'll discover a new principle or that we'll discover one of those is,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.470
we may discover a new one, but we may, I don't think we'll discover like, oh, we don't actually,

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.150
we don't value this anymore. This is dumb.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.200
We may make some word changes because like, oh, you know what?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.960
It's read this way in this context, it could make, it won't make as much sense.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.080
So let's rephrase it here so it's clear. That may happen, but I think it'll be close enough.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.160
Yeah, I'm thinking through and I think the current principles will be fine for

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.900
at least a couple of years.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.860
Yeah. And the thing I loved about that write up, and sorry,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.140
I remember we're talking about before I hit the tangents, hopefully you put a place mark in that,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:38.180
is the person that did the write up, I was just so impressed with how well they were,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.020
they're a little paragraph below each principle. They really nailed it.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.380
I don't know, I couldn't have written, I don't think I could have written a better

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.660
summary paragraph after each one.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:56.260
I know I can't. I am often accused of saying in 10 words what could be done in three.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:04.270
Yep. What's the quote from Mark Twain? I was going to write you a short letter

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.590
but I didn't have time to throw you a long one instead.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:20.000
Yes, that's me. Yeah, the, I think, so my expectations around modern principles are that

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.240
they'll adapt as we discover, right? I think one of the key things that we're saying is that in

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:38.340
the modern testing philosophy focuses on adaptation quite heavily.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.460
So there's a bunch of things, like I don't know when modern testing dies out.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:54.620
I am highly confident it will, and when it will, I'm highly confident that both Alan and I will say,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.180
yeah, stop following that crap.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:06.290
It took me three, maybe, how long until how we test software at Microsoft,

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.690
I was officially declaring it obsolete and don't read it.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.970
I started asking you that I think about five years after you did it.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.690
I think it was less. I feel like it was three or four years, like, okay, great,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.330
it's done its run. This is a great document and time. There are some good points in here.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:25.570
I think there's still, when I re-skimmed it, I think there are some good points remain

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:31.410
in that book, but as a, it was just a snapshot in time.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.610
I think, I think you'll, my hypothesis is that you'll go back and you'll go,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:43.490
you know what, a lot of the philosophy is still publicly true or mostly true,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.770
but the tactics and how to get there are just completely about it.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:55.410
Yes, I wouldn't. It's heavily focused on testing being a separate functional organization. Something

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.530
has to grow independently of the rest for software engineering. So you're looking at from that angle,

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:05.570
like no God, no. But some of the things I wrote around community with the test leadership team,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.690
actually even that is very functional, but maybe the test architect group, which may be a

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.130
better example of community and connecting people across the company. And actually,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.770
it was probably where we first started talking. And this podcast was actually born out of those

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.090
discussions when I believe it was Michael Hunter that said, Jesus, you guys, you guys should record

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.610
this as a podcast. And here we are.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:31.390
You know what it just occurred to me? You could, obviously you don't work at Microsoft anymore.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.110
Obviously.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.670
I don't think you could ship V2 of the book, but it does occur to me, you could,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:44.830
if you were to take like the overarching goals of each of your chapters and target this as a book

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.450
where your audience is a developer.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.400
It'd be interesting. Because I have a chapter on bug reporting. I mean, some of the things are

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.560
just...

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.600
So, I can help you with that one. That chapter is cut.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:11.330
So, that's what... So, yeah, that one may just need to go away. It'll be a bug reporting.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.100
Write the bug on a sticky note, put it on the board.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.380
Look, you found a bug, fix it.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.740
Chapter four.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.900
Don't worry. It would be a little bit more common. Decide if you're ever going to fix this,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.980
or if you have evidence to fix it now. If you do, fix it.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.300
If not...

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.420
That's actually a good idea.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.180
I don't know that I'd write the book, but it'd be fun to go through like,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:41.220
what is my interpretation of this general topic now, 10 years later?

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.620
Wait...

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.460
The problems are still the same.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:50.480
The book, I was... 10 years ago exactly, I was writing the book. It's not even that old.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.910
It actually... There were three authors on that, right?

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.030
Well...

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.750
Who was the third?

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.950
The BJ. So, I wrote most of it. And not that I counted, but perhaps I wrote

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.070
270 pages of the book, and then Ken Johnson and BJ wrote about 70 each.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:15.570
I'm wondering if it would be an interesting episode to get the band back together,

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.530
because I know Ken...

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.970
I have not heard from BJ in years.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.970
I wouldn't even know where to find him.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.480
I'm on his boat somewhere.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.200
But we can get the two of the three.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.360
It might be an interesting discussion, because I'm pretty sure Ken would also agree that,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.280
oh God, no. Don't use that book today.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.920
Well, and even worse for Ken, because Ken wrote the article on services testing.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.720
Yeah, sir. What was it called?

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.180
I can't remember what the chapter was called, but he wrote the services chapter.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.880
And I think he would love to just burn that entirely right now.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.700
All right. You want to get to this thing?

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.060
I forgot we were doing a podcast.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:12.180
Yeah, so anyway, deep dive coming up next time on Principle number two.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.980
One thing we'd like to do on reflection based on some of the feedback is we talked a lot about

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.860
why we thought the principle was important and tried to explain what it meant for...

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.860
And why we selected it.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.020
Yeah, and understanding like...

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.950
And some of the feedback we got was around our passion around the topic,

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.670
and they loved it.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.310
And I think we'll have that around all these, because we've vetted them enough that we believe them.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:41.150
But one thing missing that we'll try to do with no guarantees

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:47.230
is go a little bit more into the how someone would execute on that principle.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.230
What are some examples of things?

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.670
I had it in my notes.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.990
I thought we hit some of those, but the audience was thirsty for a few more.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:01.230
So I think if we can get some examples of how that principle portrays in an action

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.950
as we go through, I think that may help out a lot.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:10.620
I think as we go through each of the principles, we're still going to stick to what it means.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.020
Because the problem with principles is ambiguity.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.380
Can we just go what, why, how?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.180
What it means?

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.860
Why do you think it's important?

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.500
And then how I think is going to be very tactical,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.620
and it's going to be very sensitive to people's environments.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.820
Absolutely, but we can give examples of our lives.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.140
Because I can't jump in there and go, here's exactly, there's no recipe book for modern testing.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.620
Actually, one of the things I think, because this piggybacks off of a question Percy asked,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.060
and that is, what are you afraid of?

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.700
What's your biggest concerns with the modern principles?

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.020
And I'll share with, I'll share you with mine.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.220
Mine is we start building blind followers of the principles.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:53.920
Right?

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.160
It.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.380
Yeah, that would be awful.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.260
It would be horrible.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.620
The most important thing here, I made a career out of people not telling me what to do,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.460
because they trust me to figure out what to do.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.060
And I've thrived in that.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:13.920
I think that's actually, having some of that is really important to follow modern

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.400
testing principles, because there is no recipe book.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.760
There is no, these aren't technical challenges, these are adaptive challenges where you have to

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:28.160
influence culture and be, being a leader is so important and being able to influence people to

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.680
influence modern testing principles.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:36.940
And it's, there's no, you can't just go do a bunch of stuff and say, I follow these or you, yeah.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:44.180
Yeah, we've, I'm allergic to this concept we've talked a long time ago of test zombies.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:51.380
People in tests and dislike, oh, this, I have looked up the expert and they are the

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.460
I'm following their thing and I have faith in them.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.420
And I don't want people having faith in us.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.020
No, no.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:10.240
And yeah, if I ever see anyone quoting or using modern testing principles as a

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.980
defacto argument with those substance to it, I will come down on you.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.900
Because I see that is another testing community where I see this happen all the time.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.660
And it drives me crazy where they.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.060
Where they go, what Alan says.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.860
They don't even do that.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:30.020
They just, they, they parrot the words of their leaders without thinking about the context

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.540
in which they're being used.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.100
And it drives me absolutely nuts.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.140
Yeah.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:42.500
I want, I want people to be able to defend or fail to defend on their own.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:42.740
Yeah.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.100
This is a, the modern testing principles are for thinkers.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.300
For sure.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:52.260
Let's transition into our podcast material for the day.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.600
Part two, see if I can put this in context.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.480
He started off with a Slack message exchange between Brent and I, and he goes,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.360
stop it, stop it.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.360
Let's discuss it in the podcast.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.400
We should record it.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.280
I said, okay.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.020
So my question to Brent was roughly, I'm still working on getting,

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.390
some parts of my team are definitely data driven.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:18.030
Maybe not data centric yet, but the areas that I work on in my job span,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.350
a whole bunch of different parts of the company.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.510
And then I'm still trying to, and in some places,

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.670
influencing people that I don't work with directly to use data a little more

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.390
effectively.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.020
And I will talk to them.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.060
I'll talk to my peers.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.660
I may give little mini presentations to talk about a lot of the things we've

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.980
talked about in the past with that preamble.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:43.140
The question, a question came down to is I'm turning the corner on getting a lot

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.780
more teams to start instrumenting their code and measuring customer data.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:54.900
But what I'm finding is for many of the teams, for most of the teams,

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.900
it's difficult to collect things that are actionable.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.220
Many of the things are what Reese and I and Brent for sure would call vanity

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.630
metrics, like, or at least in some sense, like, oh, we know how many

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.990
active users we have per day.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.290
That's great.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.810
What action are you going to take on that?

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.690
And, and the answer may be, well, if we make a change in the active

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.770
users goes down, that'll tell us something great.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:21.970
What action would you take?

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.050
I'm kind of stuck there.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.530
And that's, that's even, that's a horrible example.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.890
And Brent is just calmly waiting to add all kinds of stuff,

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.530
but that's kind of the predicament I'm in.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:38.450
I want to, I need some advice on how to get people over that hump from

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.250
just collecting data, which is great and looking at it.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.680
And now collecting data that can be actionable.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.480
How, how would, how would you advise me through that?

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.240
So what I thought we'd do.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.000
So ultimately the problem that you have is people are creating KPIs.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.200
I don't know.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.480
And they don't know how to use them.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.200
I don't think they're even creating KPIs there.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.640
These aren't even vanity metrics.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.160
They're curiosity metrics.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.760
Maybe it would be good if we knew this.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.120
How many times someone click on this?

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.680
So they're guessing.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.080
Yeah.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.840
How many times someone click on this menu?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.640
Let's find out.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.720
It's like, okay, at least you're collecting.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.920
So, so actually that's, that's called exploratory data analysis.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.280
There are a bunch of great books and I will tell you,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.160
every data scientist will start with two things.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.600
EDA, exploratory data analysis.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.680
Cause you're trying to, trying to understand.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.080
All right.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.600
You're searching for an insight.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.280
How does the data work?

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:37.520
Sure.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:38.960
I get that.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.680
That's why I have a question.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.480
What questions can I ask of this data?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:42.640
Right.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.080
And we've had this discussion before.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.000
There are going way back there have been schools of thoughts on only collect data

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.440
that answers your question versus collect everything.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:59.120
And I am not against exploratory metrics and tracking things because you're curious

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.240
because you can actually eventually get a lot of information from those.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:10.900
So I have a, I have a process tool that, um, I wanted to walk you through very concretely

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.780
on the air.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.100
Okay.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.470
That I think helps to clarify that.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.790
All right.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:23.620
So the first thing I will, will do is I'll say, I want you to think of a hypothesis.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.990
Okay.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:31.700
A question, but a difference in my mind between a question that you want to ask and a hypothesis,

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.340
is a hypothesis is a statement.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.100
A statement of belief.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.700
Okay.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.580
So what is one?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.190
So I'm thinking about one of the features in Unity and I'll try and anonymize it

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.150
that all of my Unity listeners, I think one of our listeners is from Unity.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.990
Probably, probably we'll be able to figure it out, but we have a feature that enables,

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:54.940
guess it's public.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.660
I can talk about it.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.340
So I'll be less abstract in the past.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.770
You've had a thing called the launcher, which, uh, is used to pick like the project

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.290
you want to open in Unity.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.730
And now we have a new thing.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.850
We're moving people to called the hub, which is a standalone application,

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:15.300
which lets, lets you launch different versions of Unity, which is handy when you're a game

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.480
developer or as a tab, you get to tutorials as a, uh, another feed there.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.960
So just a lot more full featured standalone application.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.360
But one of the main things, the benefit is, I'll just focus on one thing.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.400
It does is it allows you to launch different versions of Unity.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.200
So, uh, we already track a lot of things like number of users per day, per week,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.480
all those kinds of things already.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:43.070
But the statement I'll make is there should be some sort of improvement we want.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.390
The statement I want to make, and you can figure out how to measure this is

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:54.960
using the hub enables our enables unity users to be more productive

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.560
when using multiple versions of unity.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.320
We can't measure productivity.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.450
So you're going to help me fix that or, or it could increase customer

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:12.370
satisfaction when using multiple versions of unity users to be more productive.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.250
And you could change, be more productive with more satisfied.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.650
With multiple users.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.130
So actually multiple versions, multiple versions.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.720
Let me, let me actually suggest a different hypothesis today.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.120
Okay.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.600
Exactly.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.520
Because what I heard you say is, hey, one of the key differentiators between

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:38.320
the hub and the launcher is that the hub, uh, will allow you to use different versions.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:45.890
So I would say that it seems like a business hypothesis is that solving the different

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.900
versions problem is beneficial to your user base.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.060
Yes.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.100
Right.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:25:06.640
Now, let us look at from a business point of view, uh, hub, the hypothesis is the hub, uh,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.280
reduces or improves.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.200
Now what's a business KPI?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.310
Like from a business point of view, why do you care about solving this problem?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.080
Main reason is it's been a big request from customers and we know from,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.360
we know from talking to them that it will make them more efficient than trying to keep

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.200
track of, you know, a bunch of different shortcut icons for different versions of unity.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.320
Okay.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.240
So it's a known pain point.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.200
It's a known pain point.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.520
Yes.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.970
But is there any, is there any business KPI that you, that you think, uh, gets improved?

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:51.440
Is it, um, uh, hey, we reduce, uh, support costs as a result of this.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:59.100
There could be some hypotheses around, uh, people may be more apt to download the,

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.860
and the new version of unity.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.300
If they know that it's easy for them to keep on using the old version for their existing projects.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.340
All right.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.140
Let's do that.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:06.700
Let's do that.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:23.180
So that I like that type of, so because of, uh, different versions support,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:34.770
hub will boost downloads, which why is that beneficial?

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.960
Stickiness.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.520
Stickiness gets people using, uh, the new features.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.790
Uh, so I'm going to change all of this and say, we'll, we'll boost retention.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.590
Sure.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.940
That's why you care about stickiness retention.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:58.700
So in general, and I will say this in the podcast, they can get away with this.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:07.250
I think this is pretty common at a lot of companies is that ideally you have

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.850
marketing or product management, thinking of these business KPIs in advance of what

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:17.250
they want to happen, but what they want to happen in with new features.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:25.620
I don't think in most cases, this is, I haven't checked with marketing or the product managers,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:32.110
but often it's like based on customer feedback and we, we have a really good relationship with

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.510
customers.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.030
It isn't just like one loud voice.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.990
So I trust that feedback was like, okay, they want that.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.230
Okay.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.270
We're going to go make that happen.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.650
Yeah.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:46.450
It's good, but without thinking about there isn't a lot of, this is probably the biggest

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.330
change I'll go through.

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:52.050
There isn't a lot of thinking about what is the business impact of doing this?

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.410
That's going to be a big shift for us.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.850
So it is important to evaluate why your customers care.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.130
I completely agree.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.980
Customers ask for a lot of things.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.340
You can't invest in the mall.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.760
Right.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.480
And so as a business.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.160
Try as we might.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:17.790
As a business leader, you want to try to say, okay, what's the order?

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:23.390
What's the thing that we tackle first in terms of, all right, what's the one that simultaneously.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:27.150
And honestly, I don't think it's hard, but just even in this conversation right here,

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.270
because I'm making stuff up.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.230
You're anonymizing a great deal.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.590
This is not unity stance.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.670
This is what I can tell from observing this.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.230
Yep.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:40.910
So I think there's an interesting growth point, again, not just for unity, because

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.510
it could be that people have thought about these things.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.910
They just communicate them well, but I'll figure it out.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.710
But I think this is a common place for, and the reason I'm phrasing it like this,

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.110
so we can instigate some of this discussion.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.790
So it's applicable everywhere.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.710
But I think for a lot of companies, a lot of software organizations,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.600
putting that little bit of effort into thinking about, well, what should happen if we do this?

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.560
What's my, I expect retention to go up 10%.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.280
I expect whatever to happen.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.840
You can actually measure that and see if it happens.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:17.600
And it now actually fully occurs to me that we may be accidentally going into an example

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.080
from episode one, like how do you tie this to the business ROI, right?

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.920
All right.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.630
So that's the next phase of this.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:34.820
So the hypothesis I've written down is because of the different version support,

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.820
hub boosts retention.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.460
That's our hypothesis.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.210
Now, what's the difference between, I'm going to take a segue, the difference between

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:52.450
an actionable KPI and a vanity KPI or vanity metric.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.100
When the actionable one changes, it tells you to do something.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:58.550
Right.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.650
The vanity is essentially what I also call a stoplight metric.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.530
It kind of communicates status.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:07.170
Sure.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.970
But yet you don't really know what's good, what's bad, what's better, what's right.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.130
Right.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.130
If you have a hundred thousand users a day, is that good or bad?

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.700
Yeah.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:23.760
Exactly.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.360
But if you're trying to drive adoption and you know that you have,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.920
and these numbers are made up, say I know I have a million users,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.640
a million potential users, and I only have, and I have a hundred thousand users,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.440
that tells me something about adoption.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.080
And depending on your, your business, that also still could be good or bad.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.480
Sure.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.520
Right. Some, some 10%, having 10% of the market is a huge deal.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.800
But if my hypothesis is, and we're not, we're not talking about the hub anymore.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.240
If my hypothesis is I'm using round numbers for evenness,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.720
that at least 90% of our users will use the new feature.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.720
And I know I have, I can measure that.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.680
So I have a statement, I know I have a million users and I have a hundred thousand.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.360
My hypothesis has failed.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.480
So I can do it.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.920
Maybe, maybe.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.480
Okay.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:10.880
All right.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.400
So, so I want to simplify the next bit of this.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.720
The reason why we care about actionable versus vanity, as you call out,

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.320
is because we want to have our metrics tell us what to do next.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:32.000
It's about just describing the situation so that we can make decisions.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.400
Reece talks about pivot or persevere.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.240
Ultimately, all decisions come back, come around to,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.520
do we need to change a direction or do we have evidence

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.680
that our desired direction is still the correct direction?

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:48.820
Right.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.050
The similarly here.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.650
Now with that hypothesis.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:02.020
And for context, as Brent thinks, that's a lean startup by Eric Reece.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.260
Yep.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.300
I believe it's chapter eight.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:11.670
So really what you're trying to do with this metric is, is select.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:18.310
Have it be able to select the appropriate action to take.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.950
Even better.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.310
Right.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.710
So we have a hypothesis.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:26.870
Now I'm going to ask you to go the next level deep.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.590
I want you to think if that hypothesis held true,

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:37.910
that different versions boosted retention.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.340
Okay.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:49.280
What are, let's say two or three actions that you would want to take?

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:54.130
That you could possibly consider taking if that hypothesis held true.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.610
And I will give you one.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.170
All right.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:57.670
No op.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.430
It held true.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.390
It's what we expected.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:01.190
It is.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.910
That's the easy one.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:02.710
That's the easy one.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:04.930
What action?

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:15.750
So here you want to think about if we can prove the different version support boosts retention,

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:28.480
then options are, okay, there's something about different version support that we might want to

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.960
even further add.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.320
So new features around just this different version support.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:36.400
Okay.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.800
We might have found a very specific focus.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:48.150
If we found that it only boosts retention slightly, right, that might be a no op situation.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:48.470
Okay.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:53.700
So it depends on, it depends a little bit on to what level of true it is.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.200
Right.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:01.490
And what I would like to do is I often like to be even more specific on these hypotheses.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.330
It will improve retention by 20%.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.360
Okay.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.480
I don't know if you like doing that or not.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.200
That's fine.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.560
Because then you can tell if it's like, okay, didn't do enough.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.160
So is it, I may have to dig in a little bit.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.880
Maybe I have, maybe it's because it's there, but the performance of switching from one

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.080
to the other is low.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.640
So I can, I can dig in a little bit deeper.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.480
I'm probably, I probably would be on here.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:31.200
So if what action would I take?

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.410
I may make improvements to the existing features.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.360
I may, or I may continue developing.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.480
Further investment.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.360
Further investment.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:40.840
Yes.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.760
That's a good summary.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.240
Okay.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.840
So I have, I can do nothing.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.630
I can do further investment.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:52.400
If it's true, I wouldn't try to think what else I would do.

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:54.420
All right.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.220
Let's just keep it there.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:04.690
So it's, if we were doing this for real, you'd probably want to spend a couple hours

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.810
going through this.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:06.290
Right.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.770
No.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.770
What type of investments would you, would you want to do?

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.130
What type of investments would you, would you want to take?

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.570
How would you decide if you need to tweak it?

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:23.350
What if you, the, another thing would be, actually, I'll give you another action.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:33.910
Maybe it only boosts, it did boost, but it failed to hit your 20% because it's only

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.070
relevant to a particular customer segment.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:43.270
You'd want to figure out if you have two major different problems.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.590
Yeah.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:49.270
Maybe, maybe it solves a problem for one segment of users, but another segment finds no use in it.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.030
Right.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:56.320
So maybe you want to target, target segments differently.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.040
Yes.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:57.920
That's good.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.000
One, one cool thing about that chapter on pivot and persevering the Reese book

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.120
is he goes through about a paragraph on eight or 10 different kinds of pivots,

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.480
which is actually pretty cool.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.200
And it would help a lot if I would have had those memorized or closer in my head

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.840
in coming up with these actions.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.320
All right.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:25.640
Again, this is kind of trying to, to get you familiar with how to use this process tool,

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.520
which is really sort of a self interview.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:28.760
Okay.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:35.240
Now, if the hypothesis proved false, what are the actions you would do?

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.960
Double down.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.640
Double down.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:37.960
Sorry.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.080
I learned that at Microsoft.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.600
So one, again, still no op is a possibility here.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.160
Right.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.600
You've already invested this thing.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.360
It proved false.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:53.970
Right.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:37:00.450
So that could be a situation of, yeah, it didn't change retention in any way, shape, or form.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:05.810
We wasted our time, but there's no, it doesn't seem like there's any harm done.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.970
So it doesn't seem like it would be worthwhile to revert.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.570
But there's another action.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:15.090
If retention went down, I would revert, but you're going to say the same.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:15.810
I could revert.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.320
You could.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.920
I don't know how to summarize this.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.240
The action I want to take is to understand why, why did my hypothesis fail?

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.320
It could, it could go back to segmentation again.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.040
And maybe I want to look, maybe, maybe I lost retention in one customer segment,

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.080
but gained it in the other.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.500
And the overall was, was even.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:35.300
Okay.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.220
So I want to understand that because that, that's going to help drive my action.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:46.520
And actually in the, the one thing I like about this framework is that it forces you to go,

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.430
Hey, if that does happen, like what am I going to do about it?

00:37:52.470 --> 00:38:00.150
Because, um, this is sort of one of the things that, uh, Reese also talks about is you want to

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.790
go, okay.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.270
How do I learn from this?

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:08.870
Like, how could I, one of the, one of the most important phrases from the lean startup

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:16.630
in my humble opinion is the analysis of how the retrospective analysis of how could I have

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:21.110
changed things to come to exactly the same conclusion significantly sooner.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.990
Yep.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:29.640
How could I have learned that we were wasting our time on day two, not on day 282.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.440
Okay.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.240
Now the hard part.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.520
All right.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:38.840
And, and to be clear, if I was being less abstract and if I was closer to this feature,

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.280
I think I could do a lot better here.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:40.920
I'm positive.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.440
But again, again, what I'm trying to do is get you familiar with the thing.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.320
Nope, I'm fine.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.800
Now, now we get to questions.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.400
So we have this hypothesis.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.920
We have a bunch of actions.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:39:00.870
What are the, what we want to try to do is go, what are the minimum number of questions

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:09.060
that if we answered all of them would enable us to confidently select the right action.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.080
Okay.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:12.240
Okay.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.040
So are you talked about we need to know retention or you want to go?

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:19.760
Yeah.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.920
So are people, what is retention before and after?

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.160
Right.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.480
What's another question?

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:29.680
What?

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.870
Well, this is of its question, but we talked about market segments a lot.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.930
So we'll need to know our market segments so we can help dissect,

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.210
but you don't want that question here.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:43.430
Maybe.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:49.240
So if, if, let me ask you, if you knew the retention before and after,

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.440
is that enough for you to confidently select?

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:54.680
No.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.810
Okay.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.330
What question is missing?

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.760
I need to know, I need a breakdown of which customers or which segments of customers are using it.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.280
Okay.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.520
So retention by segment?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:06.760
Yes.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:08.440
Okay.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.480
I'm going to help you as well.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:22.210
Uh, cause you also need usage by segment because it's entirely possible that you,

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:28.800
you could get the answers to both of these and then discover that no one's actually,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.680
no one actually use download different versions.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:33.920
Yep.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.800
I need to know which, which I would need to know of the users using the hub,

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.320
how many different versions of the product that they launch with it.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:42.800
Right.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.840
Or how many, it really, really should be how many launch three or more.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.600
And then what is the segment breakdown of those?

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:59.090
And then, uh, potentially how does those segments compared to the other segments that use launcher?

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.100
Right.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:07.990
The simple question would be of your customers, say on a daily basis, what percent of them

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.480
fall in the different versions versus the, the total.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.120
Yeah.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.880
And it could really come down to, I mean, we could rewind this whole thing now that we've

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.640
talked through it and do a better job, but we could talk about the behavior changes in

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.880
customer and usage and customer experience we expected moving from one version of the

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.320
feature to the next version.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.610
So you just highlighted exactly what I hope you would say.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:38.710
What I'm doing is giving, creating a framework where you can start with this belief statement,

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.430
begin to structurally break it down.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:48.790
The point of the questions is this, as I call out again, is how do I confidently select between

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.070
these actions?

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:56.080
And as you're now thinking about it, you're going, wait a minute, my hypothesis isn't as

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.360
good as it should have been.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:57.760
Sure.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.440
Then you start all over again.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:41:59.840
Okay.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.080
Yep.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.560
I get it.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.420
Now, once you have enumerated the questions you need to ask.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:05.380
Okay.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:12.440
Now it's very easy where you can come back and say, all right, what data do I need?

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.200
To answer these questions.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:24.160
So I'm kind of designing the data pipeline from the top down, but then when you look at it,

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:33.240
once you've gotten to the final detail, you can go from the bottom up and design what

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.120
work you need to do.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:42.420
The one missing bit that I have seen over and over again, but I haven't found a way

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.060
to generalize this in this example.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:54.020
Once you've completed this process and you're happy with it, it is fairly obvious generally

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:59.380
what is the KPI, what you need to track.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.060
So it is an iterative process.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:03.940
You go through it.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.300
You're able to find that KPI.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.740
You can also start this with your vanity KPI.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:11.840
All right.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:17.300
You can say, hey, if I do this, it'll improve this vanity KPI.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:18.820
Sure.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:24.260
But then when you go through the actions and the questions, you'll find that the vanity

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:29.800
KPI often doesn't help you do anything with your actions.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.380
And so that will force you to go back and fix it.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:33.620
Yep.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:34.900
No, I like it.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.460
It's a good plan.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.420
Definitely rings true to stuff I've read from Reese.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.700
But fun to walk through the exercise because it gives me, because I want to,

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:50.760
one of the things, so I put it this way.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:57.480
I generally using a far less structured informal format can come up with the right things to

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.680
measure after some discussion.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:06.040
But what I haven't done as well, what I want to get better at is teaching other people to do that.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.320
And this is a good framework for that.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.160
And in that show, what I'm doing is I'm saying, start with your statement of

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:17.120
belief, decide what actions you're going to take if that belief is true,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.120
then as well as what actions you're going to take if that belief is false.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:30.880
Then figure out what questions you need to ask yourself to address or to confidently select

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.920
the appropriate action.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.000
And then from there, it's easily what data do you need to answer those questions.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.320
Sure.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.280
And then iterate.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:37.920
Iterate.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.560
All right.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.600
That was useful?

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.560
Yeah, I think so.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:40.960
I'm going to...

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:42.390
Okay.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:46.710
I hope that was as useful for listeners as it was for me.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.070
If not, sorry.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.590
No, I think it was.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.310
I think it helps.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:55.350
So we're going to go back into, in two weeks, a proper deep dive with the what,

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.630
the why and the how on principle number two.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.870
Yep.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:59.910
That work for you.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:00.390
It does.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.950
It's a date.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.990
Okay.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.550
Anything else?

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.950
Nope.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:03.270
All right.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:04.070
We're out of time.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:05.670
So once again, I'm Alan.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:06.150
I'm Brett.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.950
And we'll see you next time.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:07.430
Bye.
