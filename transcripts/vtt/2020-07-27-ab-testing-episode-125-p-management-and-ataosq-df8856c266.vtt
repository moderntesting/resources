00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:11.620
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.580
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.320
Hey, Brent, how's it going? It's going super Alan. I think

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
So there's so much going on one we're still in the middle of a pandemic

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.460
to

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.260
first ever live stream of an a B testing podcast something I think we should do much more often

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.290
Yeah

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.730
Thank you

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.710
Alan and the three for for the spontaneous change

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.210
There was a suggestion less than 10 minutes ago on you guys or something like some other podcasts live streams and edits

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.810
And I thought and in that 10 minutes, I thought oh

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.210
There's an idea. We're gonna try this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.130
so yeah, we're doing it and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.490
pandemic and oh

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.490
I was thinking just a minute ago that I

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.090
like I'd like to think that there are people who discover our podcast and just binge our episodes one after the other and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.690
Are going to be sad that we don't have a guest this time

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.380
We've had guests like the last three to know for for no, I think it's I think it's just fine

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.640
But because we're live streaming everyone's our guest be our guest be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.140
See normally I edit the singing out but now it's all here for free

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.820
So well, right

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.540
So is this is this part of it is this now like a new form strategy to to edit out nothing?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.580
I mean, thank God. I actually wore clothes today. I

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.230
I'm not wearing pants. But so here's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010
Also something interesting

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.690
because we've had guests we haven't had to come up with our agendas for a while and

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.970
Because we don't have a guest and we're not used to this and we don't have a whiteboard

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.010
I don't know that we have an agenda. So this should be fun

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.970
You know, well, yeah, I think I mean the guest thing

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.990
Certainly reduced the tax on us right?

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.670
Now we now we were able to be more efficient. We don't have to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.990
You know, it's agile, right? As the principal say we we favored communication over

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.390
Documentation. So there's one, you know, five minutes of documentation work now eliminated

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.470
I'm lying here a little bit because I did post a couple things in our one of the three slack that I thought we could

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.950
Talk about today. No. No, I want to talk about I think the same one that you're thinking of

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.690
It's how to take over the world via the PM org

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.530
Well, it's not really a PM org, but I should talk about

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.770
None of this is official and I don't know who at Unity listens to my podcast

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.250
But I can talk about this abstractly and say that due to some org changes. I

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.820
Am going to end up. Well, I should probably talk about background

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.780
So many of you know me as the hardcore software tester

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.110
Alan Page the person who wrote how we test software at Microsoft

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.430
You do know me as that but you know

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.330
I have since moved on from that because unlike some people in the testing world

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.130
I do not live in the past. I try and live in the present moment and look towards the future

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.020
That is a passive of a dig as I can make on some folks, but

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.760
Yeah, oh no the three got it for sure

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.020
so

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.660
One thing and let me just say this when I began running

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.780
Infrastructure in DevOps orgs. I thought wow

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.500
I have never had so much more control over quality as I do running a DevOps

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.980
Org and helping the team accelerate the achievement shipable quality. So that's all good and then

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.660
When I started doing air quote, I can do we're live I can do air quotes

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.420
Yeah, I can like do show and tell

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.640
Yeah, like hey, here's a cool book I got no

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.180
Also, the cool thing is we're gonna have to make a live stream

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.180
Channel if we keep this because then people could ask us questions

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.100
during

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.560
The podcast I should look at the live stream and see if there are questions there

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.100
Oh my gosh, so many things to do I was in the middle of a story

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.340
So I DevOps lots control over quality

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.780
When I joined this role in my current org I began doing program management

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.820
Well, I can't say I've ever done program management

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.740
When I took the role when I was talking to my current boss about the role

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.020
he asked hey, can you do program management and

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.600
Every time in my career when I've been asked if I can do something Alan, can you code an assembly Alan?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.060
Can you do whatever?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.960
My answer is always yes. Why yes, I can and then I figure it out as I go

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.240
There's a sorry, I was gonna do tangent inception, but I'm gonna stop myself

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840
so I

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.660
spent the first

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.380
chunk of my time

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.780
Figuring out what not what program management was because I could read things about that

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.800
but what my flavor on it was and finally after

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.340
Eight or nine months in the role. I

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.820
Told my boss I said I don't really know anything about program management. I'm I'm coming clean

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.020
They said oh no problem, you know how to run systems and you're doing it and you do that well

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.580
I go. Oh, yes, that's a that's a very lean and modern testing thing

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.020
I love systems thinking and that's what I do. I figure out how all the pieces fit together. So now I

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.620
Say I have never had so much control over quality and QA testing s deading for years

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.620
I have so much control over what we deliver predictability and quality and velocity running both DevOps and

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.420
Running systems the the program management part of my job

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.300
So what the change coming up for me is I'm on paper a director of program management

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.740
We're gonna change that to director of engineering because I do more engineering work than program management

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.780
But I'm still in charge of running all of our systems and making sure that pieces all fit together of all of our different

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.100
services and and projects in flight

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.420
Going back. This is like the longest intro ever

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.980
People and you can't watch a live stream on one and a half speed. Sorry folks

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.700
so

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.640
Short story is with all that context in mind. I

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.840
Will be adding a few real like I've talked to them and they're kind of textbook program managers to my org

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.200
not Microsoft program managers, but people who manage

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.880
programs of projects

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.360
Help the team as far as I can tell accelerate the achievement of book quality if any of you

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.040
I don't know if you've read this Brent. Do you I didn't know reason to it's probably not Johanna Rothman who just writes

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.880
Book after good book after good book wrote a book called agile and lean project management, which I read

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.280
So I could understand what I was supposed to do and then pick the parts of it that I liked and did those

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.720
But if I read that book and look at what the program managers who will be working for me are doing it's textbook right there

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.590
I think they're gonna fill in the gaps that I know I have

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.150
They're going to learn to do things in the modern testing way

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.670
But the one of the topics for today and Brent is like what it's Alan ever gonna shut up

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.470
So I can talk is what I want to have a discussion about is

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.860
how

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.220
Our mission remains the same how

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.020
What advice what ideas etc should we have for?

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:07.940
These folks in my org, how do I take the most advantage of them blah blah blah, etc. Okay. I'm done with the preamble Brent

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.180
What are your thoughts?

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.420
Well, the first thing I was thinking well actually a

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.760
Tangent we'll have to figure out how we do Q&A

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.480
Because the stream does seem to be lagging not by seconds, but like by minutes

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.920
Again thankful I work close today

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.720
The fun part also is going to see and and probably nothing here so far is going to be edited

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.720
But for those that watch this and listen to the podcast they're gonna go Wow the podcast is way better than the live stream

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.240
Yeah

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.960
Alright back to the topic at hand like the first thing come on this is a be testing

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.760
We don't get back to the topic at hand. Just keep going. Oh, okay on that front

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.480
Have you noticed anything new about my background today?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.440
You're in your way you're that's that's not a virtual background you are in your office at Microsoft. I am

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.880
Dude, you are so gonna get COVID. I am

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.850
Though much at a point where I don't care as as I think I mentioned

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.210
It is having it has been having a not a non trivial and

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.050
extremely negative

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.930
impact on my mental health and

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.210
Right now

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.530
Have you ever gone on taking vacation time?

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.440
Just so that everyone would leave you alone so that you could get stuff done

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.840
Nope. Nope. Oh, well I have

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.520
Actually, I have taken like we had a four-day weekend for July 4th and

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.520
Because we get every time unity there's a Monday off we get the Friday off also

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.000
I worked both Friday and Monday for I did I just don't take the days off I'm given in order to catch up on stuff

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.800
The it's not even on catch up

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.520
from me

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.680
So

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.040
survey here and we'll get back to program management in a second they did a survey at Microsoft

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.600
Maybe we would they did a survey here at Microsoft and

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.320
around impact on COVID and

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.840
turns out

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.680
60 percent of the ICS individual contributors that responded to that said oh, yeah

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.800
They are having a satisfactory work-life balance

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.450
Forty four percent of the managers said the same thing and I was recently in a one-on-one with with

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.170
my VP and

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.370
I'm like, yeah, I am so far from that

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:01.990
44% I can't even see them from where I stand and I invented a turned in that conversation

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.310
And I said work-life balance. Yeah, that's

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.710
That's actually relatively easy to manage

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:15.630
What is completely out of whack for me is the talk doing balance?

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:22.600
Too much talking not enough doing I think the way you put that about four or five

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.220
Episodes was too much talky not enough Dewey. Oh, yeah, and yeah

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.120
I am now

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.240
In a in a in a broader space

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.880
This is a recent change from my team where we're going into more and more

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.960
higher scope customer oriented

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.790
investigations and work and

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.960
I don't know dude. I

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:57.590
Am having meetings with program managers. I have never met before from teams. I didn't even know

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.050
existed

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.890
Just right after the other. So anyway, one thing that's very nice is

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.990
right now

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.040
temporarily in

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.040
this entire building I

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:19.450
Am the only one here. So I guess I guess you can't catch kovat if but when that second person shows up you're screwed

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:26.330
Well, no, so then the other thing that's nice is the fact that I have an office if I were in open space

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
Then I would probably still be at home

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.920
If I leave my office, I got to put on my Darth Vader mask

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.300
But other than that I'm safe here

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:41.300
Tangent after tangent. I won't talk about program managers distrism reminder, but I'm going to the office on Monday

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:47.130
I'm just going for five minutes to grab all my stuff off my desk and then I'm never returning. But yes

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.290
Yeah, I actually I

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:57.370
Actually last week I went home to get stuff to bring to my office

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.410
No, it's

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.250
It this is net better. All right, so

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.680
segue back to

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.880
your prior topic right your manager said hey, do you know how to

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600
manage a

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.520
Program management. Well, he didn't ask me that he asked me

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:23.760
I mean, he just assumes I can manage program managers, but well and the reason why is of course

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.200
You can

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.760
Of course, I mean there's also I mean my team is

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.590
Is glue and is glue?

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.150
Well, that's I mean it's between

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.590
Program management and DevOps and my quality coaches and even docks

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.630
It's like I provide the matrix org for all of the rest of the organization

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.550
Everybody else works on shipping stuff. I helped them ship stuff safely and successfully

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.750
Okay

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.520
Yeah, I was gonna say something snarky about program management, but I've again

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:08.480
I was my mind based on my experience with the bastardization of the role of Microsoft be very much welcomed

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.280
What snarkiness? Yeah. Yeah because what program managers do at Microsoft is different than

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.760
It's not program management. It's just the it's a name

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.320
They've given a bunch of people doing random stuff

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.880
That sometimes is program management very often is not

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.830
Yeah, no a lot of the times

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.510
right, it's

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:41.310
The snarky comment I was gonna say is is essentially of course you can write a brain dead monkey could manage some program management work

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:49.710
Oh, absolutely, right and and I have been compared have compared I have been compared to a brain dead monkey before so that's

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.750
My target by me on the podcast I'm certain of it

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.630
So let me let me share with you

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.830
what I'm about to do and

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.560
Well, we'll see what happens in terms of the podcast

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.720
Actually, this is fascinating

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:19.880
So one of these buttons right if I hit share screen, I would theoretically be sharing screen and that would show up. Oh

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.000
Yeah, so I'm over the whole surprise of hey, it's a video cast now

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.080
Now I'm all about Oh what new toys

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.240
You you have seen

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:39.330
We're primary a podcast. So I don't know how much I should focus on this is special

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.850
I'm people gonna listen to this on next week when it comes out

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.490
Who am I kidding everyone to everyone who downloads the podcast is already watching the livecast

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.650
But someone somewhere is going to listen to the some point going man. I'm missing out

00:15:52.370 --> 00:16:00.170
Yeah, no, actually we should look at the stats on the podcast download and see and see if we took a hit cuz if everyone's

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.370
All of our listeners are watching right now. Why would they download it's gonna go from three to two

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.050
Oddly, there are 13 of the three watching. I think some people are logged in on multiple machines

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.530
You've seen this

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.530
right a

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:21.930
Million times. Well, what we are actually trying to do now is push this

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.650
Further I would say right now my organization

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:33.370
I don't know if my mouse is coming across but we're somewhere in between data affirmed and data driven

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.450
Let me just help take a moment here to pause and help the people who are

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:44.530
Actually listening to the podcast and not one of the three on the on the lately announced livestream

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.470
So this is the data maturity model that Brent I think Steve Rowe came up with this, right?

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:56.050
No, this was primarily mine, but Steve Rowe did add data affirmed

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:02.850
So the four levels of data oblivious when you just you're oblivious to data data affirmed

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.850
Decisions made mostly by intuition, but you you believe this is where a lot of teams

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:12.090
I work with are they only believe the data if it confirms intuition

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:20.370
Data driven where decisions are made by intuition and data and then data centric where data analysis is core to most decisions

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.210
So we've talked about this before on the podcast drink

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.890
Yeah, but it's a very nice

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.250
graphic with with

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.030
Colors and things it's very pretty so now Brent on to your

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:38.450
Remembering this is a podcast that happens to have a live stream and not a video cast. Please continue. Yeah

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.910
That's that's so much of an ask for me. And I know you're aware of that

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:49.510
Now we think about what is the well, I'm thinking about what is the problem we're facing here. Okay, so

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.670
first and foremost, there's a common thing within the the PM org where

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.470
They won't go after

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:03.310
The whales right and this is because they're trying to scale right you have you have

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:09.010
In a lot of businesses you have, you know, just a handful of customers that are bringing in

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:16.750
The the most of rather revenue and now that most amount of revenue is not something that you can that your business would survive

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.060
on if

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.060
You lost everybody else

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.340
Typically if you pull together a histogram

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.980
it'll come up and it'll show as a as a head tail curve and this is a

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.300
situation where it in order to scale the focus on the head and

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:39.780
More often than not you'll find that between three to five to seven times

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:46.820
The thingies whatever you're measuring with that histogram are in the body and the tail

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.580
Then in the head so you you you really

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.140
Cannot ignore that tail

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.850
But when you have so much

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.100
manual

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.100
work as

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.420
As a requirement for moving

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.140
needles forward

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.020
You really can't scale to go in and you know

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.580
Talk to every one of those customers you have you end up focusing on the head

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.500
So here's it's around. How do we scale? Okay, the the second problem?

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.780
that we're we're working through is

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.060
Essentially confirmation bias or or

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.020
It's closer to what what is known as the Texas sharpshooter bias

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.020
Which is essentially we see a behavior with PM's that have an intuition

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:46.870
And it might even be a variant of data affirmed, right? They have an intuition

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.870
and then they go and scan the data for the subset of

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.670
Of data that proves their intuition

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:03.940
Right. Are you familiar with the Texas sharpshooter bias? I am now though. Yes. Yes

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.420
It's you think of it. They call it that way you think of it as you know

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:15.620
A Texan shooting at a barn and he's got his eyes closed and hey, I could do this bang bang bang bang

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:21.820
He he shoots shoots at the bar. Okay, and then once all of his ammunition is gone

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.900
he goes and looks at the barn and then draws the target and

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:33.100
And explains to everybody how look how awesome of a shot he is that that behavior is happening

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.100
Where we're at is trying to figure out

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.660
how to use the data and

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.900
Convert it to benefits of customer. I mean that's rather generic

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.780
I think everyone's trying to do that to some degree

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.700
Here is a single most interesting problem that I will be facing the next six months

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.660
Microsoft Azure for example has a lot of

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:07.420
And again, just as a quick reminder for everyone. Azure is like AWS or GCP. Anyway, go on

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.800
Yeah

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.320
Except Azure continuously threatens to take over AWS and no one actually talks about GCP

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.440
And as a side note IBM has one as well

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.400
That just came out of nowhere. Oh, and there's a lot of smaller ones out there too

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:35.790
But anyway, I'm I don't want to go into a tangent because I'm unsure where this story is going now. So

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.460
it's essentially

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.500
my mission is

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.580
essentially to

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.860
guide the PM's on

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.660
effective usage of data

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.030
to

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.390
drive better more

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.710
valuable

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.590
backlogs

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:05.070
The thing is mine after I got get that rolling and I've already talked with my VP

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:12.790
Like one of the things that's gonna happen as a result is it's gonna force a requirement on the engineering teams to be

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.750
significantly more adaptable

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.940
And that will probably create a few headaches

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.180
We in Azure we we have we operate a service

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.420
We are fairly

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.300
Agile given our size right there's there's

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.240
easily 10,000 people working on Azure

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:44.870
The the next thing then is going to figure out. Okay, how can I remove the

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:51.040
remove or significantly cut back the PM role, right if if

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.880
PM's get talented at using the data to to evaluate the

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.550
The next steps and as well as more efficiently evaluate the opportunity of those next steps

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.840
That's the biggest problem is

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.800
The other behavior we see is they go talk to a single customer and that customer is

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.080
Is a member of what you would call the vocal minority?

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.440
you'll see them executing a huge amount of

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
engineering resources and

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:29.910
Then at the end of the day not see the big the big business needles move significantly, right?

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.150
It's because yeah, you just spent half of your engineering team

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.030
working on a one-off for three customers

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:43.150
anyway, so let me you know that Saturday Night Live skit where

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:48.870
Someone's talking about something but not really the thing they think they're talking about

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:56.420
So let me do that with you slightly. So that's so the problem is is the

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.900
Taintedness of Microsoft a little bit here. Let me explain why so we have

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.390
You know PM is an overloaded term

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.910
program managers at Microsoft typically are some hybrid combination of

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.310
typical program management

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:20.640
product management and project management and those are all you know project management is

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.850
Jira shepherding I

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:30.050
Call it that because we don't have we just don't have project managers in our org our dev leads are perfectly capable of doing that themselves

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.570
But we do have product managers who are responsible for

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.450
Talking to the customer defining the product figured out what we need to do for customers

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:45.970
And we could definitely help make them more data driven and then engineering deliver on the the development work for that

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.370
what program management does in

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.970
most of the real world and in my org is

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.780
One is to help the organization to understand progress as a whole

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.440
This is where you helped me with some stats a while back to help me get a better idea on how to

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.720
The big insight there was I was trying to track velocity

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.280
But I had like hundreds of projects and Brent just without thinking about it says well

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.700
We'll just use the week started as the as the cohort and it's like oh now it's easy

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:23.000
I just couldn't figure out where to start. So thank you again for that to figure out what systemic problems the organization is encountering

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:29.400
also to make sure and in that making sure that product managers those who talk to the customers to find the product and

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:36.640
delivery owners the engineering leadership across the org are working together cohesively and then

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:45.140
Once we identify those any problems or obstacles or agile word impediments in the way product and then during our working

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.280
By or my soon to be had program small program management team

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.240
Will dive in on on those

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.660
given that lens of

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:04.940
Program management the way I'm running it and I think it's more typical than the than the hybrid role at Microsoft

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.540
I intend to use my program managers

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.300
much like I use my quality coaches as

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.530
agile coaches

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:20.010
Helping teams figure out. I have another tangent to go in in there helping teams figure out

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:25.090
What is blocking them like like I can't scale enough to attend team retros

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.370
But I'm hoping my program managers and quality coaches for example can

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:34.210
Can attend those retros help people figure out how to find their?

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:39.330
Problems and obstacles and impediments and then make sure they have ideas and how to improve those

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.580
Yeah, actually as I'm thinking about it. I haven't thought about it until right now, but I will

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:53.020
Program managers on my team. Of course, I'll probably stick them on some of the larger hairy projects that I I don't get enough time

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.860
They'll help me scale because often for that part of my role

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.540
It's just a lot of coaching some tracking some some metrics on things that I care about

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.700
But mostly a lot of coaching and helping people figure things out

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.380
That'll help me scale that quite a bit. So I there's gonna be a lot of overlap in

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:15.740
Mission between them and the people who are in sort of a quality coach consultant role on my team

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.640
So that's one way. I think I can use them one quick tangent

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.000
I'm gonna shut up for a minute is I just did

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.920
It was stupidly easy to do

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:34.000
We had some questions on like how do we get teams to not get better estimates?

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
That's a fool's errand but to understand

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.840
Actually, it was how do we get teams to do better planning?

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:46.080
Because for me, I don't care about the estimate. I care that you actually did the right planning to to reduce risk and

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.760
I did an experiment where I got six different teams to begin using story points for about six weeks

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.000
check some data on capacity and plan to work etc and

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.270
as

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.030
expected things were better and and the and the feedback from the team on

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.590
How things went and change was like over the top good

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:12.630
But all that happened was because they had to do story points and the team had to agree on assigning a number is they got

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:19.550
better at planning and I couldn't say I'm gonna do an experiment where I track how well teams are doing on improving planning because

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.070
They that would be BS

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:26.350
But if I call it story points and then teams are super happy and they feel like they're doing better planning and the work shows

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.830
that then all of a sudden people are excited about it, but

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.510
Doing more things like that to help teams become more

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:37.790
I don't want to say predictable though to come out of it, but just help them, you know

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.550
Give them more tools to stumble towards success

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:46.570
So anyway that reframing relensing and an example there

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.570
curious on your thoughts on that

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.370
So a big portion of what you said

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.530
to me seems

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.050
They again an exact match to

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.050
To what I'm working through

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:09.460
Right. I heard you mentioned that you work you're gonna put them on sort of sticky problems

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.380
right and and and

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.960
smoke jumping

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.660
Yeah, I don't have enough coffee to follow that metaphor

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.000
So so they're gonna go in and put out a fire somewhere. So we have an org of three

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.520
It's not Azure 10,000 which I could look over at the listeners over here a little ridiculous, right? So

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.600
350 engineers and at any one time there are

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.920
Right now 70 probably go into about 80 different projects in flight at once

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.400
Some of those are bigger than others and some need a little bit more corralling than I have time to scale to do

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.040
So I would love to say hey person a it looks like

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.490
Team be delivering these five projects that all work together could use a little help

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.290
Making sure they're doing the right planning and delivery

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:05.090
I want to understand what their obstacles are see if there's systemic problems we can fix things like that

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:09.810
I can put them on projects that I just don't have time. I just don't have the time to scale what to right now

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.180
so you're the the

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:19.180
The org you're inheriting are are they closer to sort of DevOps live site type

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.610
problems

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.610
Not a not a feature

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.890
owners, it's how

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:32.500
No, so, of course, I will continue to run DevOps and my and docs and other stuff other matrix orgs

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:38.420
but program management again going back to what I want our organization to do is is

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:47.220
help the team understand progress find obstacles that to progress and then velocity slash predictability and quality and

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.940
Find solutions for those over time. Some of those are just measuring things broadly across the org

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.060
Sometimes it's diving deep into part of the org to help them solve something

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.060
To help them solve a problem local to a smaller part of the org

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.560
Okay, but it's about it's about software. It's software delivery everything from

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.160
services that we update multiple times a day to

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.840
websites and SDKs

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:19.550
So the the reason why I asked that question is because what I didn't hear you

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.090
say is anything I want the lines of

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.910
searching for

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.340
better more valuable opportunities. So what I hear you say is

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:40.180
problem searching for problems and putting out the fire which is a bit reactive. Yeah, actually that's a good call out

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.220
so something you're saying I

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:48.020
Think I interrupted before you finish saying what you're saying to say there should be a more proactive

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.780
Aspect to this role and I think you're right. Please continue. Oh

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.860
so

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.060
I'm not gonna load up the slide but

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.940
Again, but the the message that I try to get across there is that the power

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.940
Really comes from intuition plus

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.100
data

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.420
Unfortunately as with the tech that stands today

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.780
data AI

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.380
doesn't

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.380
have the ability to

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.660
to tell you

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.580
Doesn't have the ability to construct game changers. I

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.090
Can't come up with a great example

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:34.850
At the moment there have been times in the past and maybe it'll slowly page load as I tell the story

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:40.690
But in times in the past we look at the telemetry and the scenario we targeted and

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.320
the people who are

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.520
active users

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.380
Don't align. I

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:57.900
Shift something out and I have a particular customer segment in mind and I see that none of those customer segments are

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:05.660
Using the product, but there's this whole other customer segment that is you know, sending positive feedback

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.260
actively using it and we're like, oh wait a minute we actually

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.480
we failed at building a solution for segment a

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.800
but we accidentally succeeded in building a solution for segment B and

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.600
Actually

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.960
Given that I

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:32.120
I've been in one conversation. We're like, wait a minute. Are we in are we targeting the completely wrong business?

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:39.140
In turns out that in that scenario, I guess we were we repivoted and it's thriving

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:45.480
Anyway, so yeah, I again, I do think that we're on the the same page

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.280
So for in a lot of regards, I'm just coming at it from a data science aspect. I

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:56.660
Am partnering with throughout Azure. I am partnering with

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.060
It's probably closer to ten versions of your future role Alan

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:10.340
But at times it feels like thousands because they send their ICPMs to me too and we're all on the same page. I

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:18.780
That team brings sort of a wealth of history around customer problems customer engagements customer feedback

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.500
it's the

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.500
Here's the great way of saying it

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:26.390
EQ and IQ

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:30.100
Right. How how do we get EQ and IQ?

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:38.460
Working together towards common goals and I will say the the program management org is often chock full of EQ

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:40.590
Yes

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:47.670
Right. The the other problem is they're also often chock full of ego and I'm sure not actually your employees

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:52.010
Well again, you need to take your Microsoft skewed lens off there

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.150
So if you go back to the Weinberg quote eventually, it's always a people problem

00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:01.070
Horribly paraphrased but that's what they when I wear the program management hat. That's what I do

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.970
it's about figuring out getting people to

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.730
reflect and

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.610
Discover what it is. They're missing and make changes. I

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.090
So to push back on your pushback

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:21.210
I don't think I'm in a bubble when I say it's a common phenomenon in the program management org that

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.900
Several of those folks believe themselves to be the second coming of Steve Jobs

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.380
Again, those people exist in product management not in program management

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:39.490
Okay. So one of the problems is yeah, no, no Microsoft doesn't have a product management role

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:45.570
Right. So you're taking over product management. No, no, that's a whole other org

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:46.690
Oh

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:52.610
So they work and my job is to make sure that and actually the big biggest part of my job as a program manager

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:57.410
Hat is to make sure product and engineering are aligned and in sync

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.240
So I make sure they work together actually, it's I mean it could be luckily it's not it's just

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:13.680
nudging them towards the proper reflection and figuring out the right ways to work together the right ways to recognize dependencies the right way to

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:20.760
plan their work another example is I help them and everybody uses the word MVP and

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.520
Most of them mean different things. I one of the things

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:30.560
Manager hat is I help I remind them what an MVP is and what it's for

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.920
Which in what is it for?

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:47.890
It's to learn it's to give every feature you can to to match your competitor because if you don't have all of your competitors features

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.500
It's not an MVP

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.500
Well, yeah

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:59.540
What is the minimum thing we have to do in order to learn if we're heading in the right direction or not or to

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.200
Or to validate or invalidate our smallest hypothesis

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.720
Smallest

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.800
In general. Yes, the smallest amount of work we have to do to validate or invalidate our hypothesis

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.520
Well, it's not a matter of work

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.000
We have to do to learn what we need to learn to pivot or persevere, right?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.680
Is it that so and we've talked about the concierge MVP here before so sometimes it's like let's just munch this on the back

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.680
And see if they like this. Let's put out the button

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:36.520
We've we even got as far as like don't even do the button that says coming soon. Just let the button 404

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.940
That's less work. If if you put if I if I

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:49.370
So I will freely admit I will probably continue to struggle on what is the distinction between a product and a program management

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.770
Right. We have we call it all program management

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.700
Here I have no doubt

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:04.330
That the that the role is served here at Microsoft. It's just under the same mantra. So

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.090
However

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.440
the if if what you

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:17.380
Do with your team is say look I'm gonna hold you accountable

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.640
for the ROI of the engineering org

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.560
Your job is to provide the most bit bit the the most business value

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.980
using the least amount of engineering resources as possible and

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.440
Validated value. That's the print of the MVP

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.840
like if if you ship something and

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.990
I don't want to hear a bunch of pretty speeches around

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:49.590
This is this is one negative thing that happens at Microsoft

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.910
every year in May June is

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.050
Is all the ship announcements come out in?

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:02.410
In teams have no, you know managers often have to differentiate

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.620
on

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.340
BS

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.340
things it's

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.740
It's it's an old-school

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:18.070
culture that's still to some degree persists here it is we celebrate

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.950
shipping not

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.950
Celebrate moving

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:30.380
The needle and that's the big thing that can't you celebrate both?

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.010
You can and you probably should

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.950
But they in my mind

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:46.350
Should not be weighted anywhere close to the same and we don't load everything because I actually

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.470
one of the things I do

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.390
to support

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:57.270
My alignment of product and engineering is I have a 30 minute sync meeting each week

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.750
Where I go over products at risk

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:04.870
Talk about what why delays are in place. I offer a little bit of coaching in that meeting

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.560
It's a way to celebrate our culture of transparency and what's going on

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.760
And a way to accelerate learning. It's all it's really more about building the culture and celebrating the culture

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.170
Than a status meeting, but I use it to help create alignment

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:28.290
But I also send out notes every week and so at the top of that every week is projects completed

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.090
So we celebrate completion

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:33.930
Weekly and we ship between these are customer impacting things

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:39.810
So between five and ten things a week across the org, so we celebrate that frequently

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:44.810
But we also celebrate another means moving the needle in a variety of different ways

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:49.410
Well, so it's it's an end versus a means right?

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.130
One of the I have some the last couple of months I have

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:59.060
doubled the size of my team and so I have a bunch of

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:04.820
Brand new folks never worked at Microsoft before and one of them is is

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.460
very high level and

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.180
He's sort of struggling because I think he got hired into a level of

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.570
a band too high

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.370
and and I'm like look

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.780
He put in his connect or his review as part of it. We communicate

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:33.580
What we're gonna go after what is our personal mission in the unity context and what is our goal?

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:39.100
And he's like, you know what? I am going to be really proud if at the end of the next six months

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.100
I have built a tool and

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.960
And

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.920
It's generating insights like crazy. Okay, and I'm like, okay I get that

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:56.080
However, I need you to understand in the band that you're in the business does not care

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.100
What the care is that you're taking on and and moving the needle

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:10.960
Anything else is just the means to an ends if you were a lower level. Yeah, we care because it's part of you

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.240
Maturing and growing and being part of this

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:22.640
Learning how to get things done in this particular culture, but at the band that he's in it's it's

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.360
Yeah, a lot of those rules go out the window because it's already expected that you know

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.180
how to do

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.860
These things

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.520
You know how to build tools, you know how to to produce software, you know how?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.560
I'm trying to get his bar set to the correct place

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:51.760
Likewise, like if you take your program management team, like I said if your team it is sort of the

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.780
The subjective voice of the customer and the qualitative feedback

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.500
How do we close that loop?

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:05.260
The the you need EQ and IQ to really master the scenario

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.420
Says this man

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:13.690
I don't know that there's science that validates what I just said, but it is certainly it is a

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:20.250
Set of beliefs that have been baked into my experience. I think this will be a continued

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.290
I want to move towards a wrap-up here. I think this will be a continued

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.330
discussion I

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:31.170
Again, I want to get it's we're about helping the team manage predictability

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.050
velocity and quality and

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:39.250
We do that by aligning product and engineering and finding problems and solving those

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:44.010
So I want to be able to get you out of the Microsoft PM

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.350
box and think about it's really much more of a

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.150
agile coach and

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.590
problem solver role so but I do want to talk about

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.510
coming up is

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.350
If we're responsible for delivery

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.520
Predictability and quality the metrics we track the metrics

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520
I track

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:12.040
Around that and see what you think about those because I do I did put some metrics in place and they make sense to me

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.540
And they're not driving the wrong behavior. So I like them

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:21.120
What metrics I said I talk about him another time. That's a teaser and speaking of teasers

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.680
I had a meeting just before I tease this on the one of the three slack

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:32.120
Group which you can join the short answer is I was trying to get someone to move someone to my org not a PM different

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.120
different different role I managed and

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.400
they I

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.840
Did not agree they did not get them to agree to move them

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:47.560
But I did get them to agree to let the employee make the choice which actually is better in my experience

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:52.960
They're gonna they're gonna let the the person choose whether they want to stay in their current org or move to my org

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.200
So I'm actually

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.220
Even though we don't I don't have an answer. It's still up in the air. I'm I'm happy with that

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.630
Outcome

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:07.710
Yeah, one of the positive things that has changed here at Microsoft if you remember back in the day

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:13.250
There was the no pooching role. Yeah, that was gone before I left you saw a pooching

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.130
poaching

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.690
Poaching yeah, and now it's yeah

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:22.570
you can and I love and this is a you know, I rank on Microsoft a little bit because

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:23.810
and

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:30.410
Honestly JW's article on why he left. It's like the the old guard are slowing down Microsoft and

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:35.370
And I was working for a lot of the old guard and just drove me freakin baddie towards the end

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:40.210
but I love that HR had the kahanas to

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:48.050
On their site about management said poaching was okay. They didn't call a poaching. So what happens if all my employees leave and

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.530
And

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.690
You're not a manager anymore, are you?

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.010
Yeah, no the

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.370
Right it did that same call out on nature web

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:08.210
Says explicitly the only way to guarantee your employees stays is

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:14.570
For you to ensure your environment is better than alternatives. Yep

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.590
And I love that I do too

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:23.870
What happens if all your employees leave? Well Darwinism kicks in that's what happens

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.190
right and

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.190
net benefit to the business

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.710
CS love II

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:31.950
however

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:39.470
however, and one last dig before we go is there's not always a good motivation to do that because of

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:43.670
and although stack ranking is over the

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:49.310
Performance review process still says if you want more money and more options

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.590
You go be the best person on a crappy team

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:58.590
Then go join a good team where you can learn more and deliver more ish

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.510
That was well, I don't know. Let's change. It was a hundred percent true three years ago

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.820
And as I mentioned the old guard is still there

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:11.700
But so I'll just I'll just plant that seed you can add one rebuttal and then we're gonna say goodbye

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.020
We can use the rebuttal

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.110
wouldn't that be great for a debate someone says and

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:23.470
Furthermore article 2 states that and you go ish

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:32.030
Mike drop. Yeah, I like I like I like doing you know going back to third grade and just you know respond with nah

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:35.320
I know you are but what am I? No

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.370
All right, everyone. I hope the livestream was a success

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:44.170
We're gonna do this again next time if you want to see the livestream

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:50.730
You're gonna have to go join one of the three slack group. I can go to modern testing org and find a link there and

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.850
Thanks the ten or twelve you the of the three that watched

00:47:55.850 --> 00:48:01.410
I hope you get a chance to see or hear the hear

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:10.290
What it's like after I edit the scrap. Yeah, I'm puzzled. Should we be thanking them or apologizing to them actually apologizing

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:12.290
Yes, we're sorry

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.010
Please sorry

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.010
Please go back to watching Terminator

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:20.710
Yeah, or the expanse. Oh, yes. It's dances awesome

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.740
Okay. All right. Hey, thanks, Brett. See you next time
