WEBVTT

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.720
A B Testing, the modern testing podcast. Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.160
I am mindless agile robot. I must iterate.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.670
As we talk about software engineering, software quality,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.910
leadership and whatever else comes to mind. Now on with the show.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.200
We're back. Howdy. It's another episode of A B testing. Yay.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.600
As we count down as Casey Kasem would have in the seventies and

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.880
probably longer. I used to listen to Casey Kasem every Sunday night.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.900
I did America's top 40 countdown with those little

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.380
and a mighty six 90 with those stories. I don't know what station it was on here.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.100
Anyway, we're counting down to episode 100, but we're not there yet.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.780
Yeah. We're a few away. I just made myself feel really old.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.060
I can the day the pop music channel was on at a.m.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.220
Wowzer. So we're back. We took an extra week off.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.580
Travel snow, life, work, etc.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.450
Yeah, you you have you've you've had your

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.890
years worth of change in the last few weeks.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.210
Have I? I think so. Maybe we'll talk about that in a.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.130
Damn it, Alan. I deserve that. I deserve that.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.090
I totally deserve that.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.650
That was well, well placed. We couldn't have rehearsed that any better.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.690
Oh, my God. Yeah.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.700
It's been a hack of the first of the year.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.060
Mostly good stuff.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.860
Took a week off to go skiing, a bunch of work stuff.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.580
I'll talk about in a minute.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.500
Kind of hangs in limbo, but mostly I think all good.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.580
Hey, everyone. Alan breaking in before we get too far to talk about our sponsor

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.700
on A.B. testing this week, PractiTest.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.820
You may have heard of PractiTest from Joel, who is one of the three

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.340
or from the online test conference, which is sponsored by PractiTest.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.060
Joel himself gave Brent and I a walk through this week of PractiTest.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.180
And I have to say, we were both pretty darn

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.420
impressed about what it is and what it does.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.900
As you're aware, there's no one size fits all in testing.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.460
That's why they built PractiTest to be a centralized solution

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.420
that supports testing of different types and sizes,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.940
whether it's scripted, exploratory or automated,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.700
or whatever they work for you.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.380
They envision a place where all testing data will reside

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.940
so that stakeholders can generate the information required for their needs.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.100
Another issue they're trying to solve is that you can create

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.380
and run more tests and more type of tests,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.340
and you end up having a ton of data in the system.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.260
Having a lot of data can be harmful if you can't control it.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.420
This is why they introduced a revolutionary approach to data organization.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.060
Instead of burying the data in folders within folders,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.860
they allow users to work with a hierarchical filter trees

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.220
that are based on the same data you're storing.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.340
This enables teams to organize information in more flexible or multiple ways,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.660
helping to generate better reports and visibility into product and process.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.580
At PractiTest, they believe that a tester's job is not to test

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.420
for the sake of testing, which is true for A-B testing as well.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.540
But to create visibility and provide information

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.820
that will help the team release better products and do it faster.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.740
For that reason, having a platform that supports testing is not enough.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.420
So they put a lot of effort into their dashboard and reporting modules

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.540
to make sure anyone can get the relevant information they need

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.980
in a format that works for them and when they need it.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.740
Overall, I was super impressed with PractiTest,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.020
not trying to be everything for everyone and being some huge, massive.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.740
I'm not going to throw any names under the bus here,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.780
but one of those solutions that tries to do way too much.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.860
PractiTest is straightforward, simple and very powerful.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.460
Of course, having access to the data and using that to form your reports

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.900
and make your decisions is a great way to catalog your testing effort.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.620
So check them out at practice.com.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.340
That's P-R-A-C-T-I-T-E-S-T.com.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.900
Thanks. And now back to the show.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.340
My pact to not speak my policy,

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.820
my something to not speak at conferences in 2019 was tried.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.020
A game company asked me to come speak at their internal conference in Barcelona.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.780
It's like, oh, K-boy-no.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.060
And the thing is, the thing is, it's like, oh, my God, I want to go to Barcelona.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.420
I'm honored. They want to talk about modern testing.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.340
I should go. I should go.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.300
And it's not like I just this random like I want to I'm not speaking at conferences

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.560
and that's the way it's going to go is now, you know, months out from actually going.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.880
It's like, yeah, sounds great.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.200
But every time I do that, the week leading up to it, I think, why did I say,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.720
yes, I don't have time for this? I don't want to go.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.770
So I'm going to there's always more important things, too.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.130
And I like conferences and.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.950
So I had a little tangent in my brain that I wanted to reel it a little bit,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.550
but I just taken a break for a bit.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.630
I don't know if I'll make it all the way through the year without speaking,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.310
but I'm going to give it a shot.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.030
Someone. Well, you actually tweeted recently

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.790
that you've handed the mantle of test conferences back to Whitaker.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.910
Yes. Would it? Oh, my God.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.870
So our dear friend, I mean that truthfully.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.470
James Whitaker posted a tweet how after leaving test conferences,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.870
seven, eight, whatever it was years ago, he's going to do some again

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.670
this year and talk about AI machine learning and how they're applied to testing.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.950
And the test community, oddly, I thought a lot of them didn't

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.600
didn't respond well to that. You watched the replies.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.560
I did. People were people are still

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.240
and I'll get the phrase right here off of what I read on Reddit.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.240
But the phrase is people are butthurt.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.440
That that that James said testing was dead.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.320
And my God, you would think 12000 people were in the audience

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.360
for his talk where he mentioned test was dead.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.880
But no, it was star. It was a couple hundred.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.460
And what was lost in that is the message that test.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.740
Testors aren't dead. Testing isn't dead.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.540
Test, as you know, it is changing enough for a lot of you consider it dead.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.220
But God, I just it's just I the king is dead.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.620
Long live the king. Test is dead. Long live test.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.180
Yeah, I think the way the accurate way you described it

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.500
just a second ago is test as you know, it is dead.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.100
Sure. Yeah. Right.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.580
And we've been talking about that on this podcast for well over

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.420
the last year, exclusively almost.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.660
Yeah, I mean, almost the whole time. Really. You're right. Right.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.850
One of the interesting I went back, I think in 2013,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.940
I commented on this after having a chat with Whitaker when he was still at Google.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.380
It's almost if it's not dead for you.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.660
What are you doing wrong?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.740
Yeah. And because you're still living in also we're preaching to the choir

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.620
a little bit here because A.B. testing listeners kind of get it.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.500
They've they've many of them have come to accept what we mean by principle.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.180
Number seven, it's not about test being dead.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.620
It's just like you may mature enough.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.940
You may not need to dedicate someone to testing.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.660
Testing's an activity. Yes.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.700
Anyway, and consider the whole shipping system.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.890
One thing interesting, and I'm going to forget names here of the three.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.010
And by the way, one of the three dot slack dot com is

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.890
one of the proudest things that has come out of this podcast.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.410
Yeah, I love it. And thank you, Percy.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.930
Yes. First, kicking that off.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.850
And thank you, everyone, all three of you who are in that channel daily

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.250
asking questions, answering questions.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.250
It's fantastic. And just starting discussions that are interesting.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.650
Someone pointed out. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes. Oh, yes.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.600
Have you learned about super tacos?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.520
No. Yeah, I know.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.880
I gave one out. How do you give a super taco?

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.440
So what I'm and wait, this is a joke here.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.560
Oh, to be clear, what we're talking about, if you use slack,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.040
there's a service called Hey Taco and Hey Taco gave us a sweet,

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.840
sweet deal on using their service on one of the three dot slack dot com.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.720
And if your company uses slack, I highly recommend it.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.280
It's just a fun way to give other people recognition.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.720
It's freaking awesome.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.760
So we've been giving each other tacos.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.560
And then so that's the context of what we're talking about.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.120
But I've never heard of a super taco, but now I want to know when you get

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:24.420
or give enough tacos, you have the ability to give out a super taco.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.220
I have not been tackling enough.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.460
I actually gave out the first official super taco.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.620
That is fantastic.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.580
To Chris Kent's for making the last weeks or two weeks

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.820
a week before last webinar.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.940
So easy for me.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.180
That's awesome. Yeah, it was how the webinar go.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.140
I want to bounce back to conferences in a second.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.500
But now that we're on webinar, we're going to go down that road

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.860
and then rewind back up to the top. Sounds good.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.040
Webinar went well.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:02.840
The thing that I so I have not unlike the podcast,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.640
I have not been able to re listen to my own the whole webinar.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:19.180
I'm very clear now on how much I'm editing you do for the podcast.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.900
And I greatly appreciate it.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.140
I thought I thought you didn't notice.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.500
No, this they're literally not exaggerating 50 minimum an episode.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.290
To be clear, I take a bunch of my own out as well,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.010
but not nearly as much as the Brit a master.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.930
Yeah, I need to find a way to fix that because I can only

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.290
I've been listening to that webinar,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.850
re listen to it and sort of 10 minute chunks

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.140
because that's as far as I can take it before I'm like, oh my God.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.820
That's the problem with video with your video.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.120
It's difficult to edit out the ums. Yes. Yes.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.640
Toastmasters, I did a couple of sessions of it a long time ago

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.120
and that helped out a lot.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.920
They have an off counter and they just count filler words.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.130
What's the filler word?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:19.450
Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.460
OK, those aren't getting edited out.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.220
So anyway, uh, cool.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.060
Yeah, recording available on it's up on YouTube or the AST website.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.980
We should probably give them a little plugs and say, uh, spot.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.780
You talk right now. Um, damn it.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.510
Do you just search for Brent Jensen? Um, no.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.430
Though that might work.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:47.110
There are three Brit Jensen's now up on YouTube or at least three.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.150
One's a jazz artist who I think is pretty good.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.110
And one's a painter.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.350
And now there's me with, uh, this webinar.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.750
If you search for Alan Page,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.350
you'll get a whole bunch of the Supreme Court Justice playing football.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.750
So webinar format.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.610
I was telling Chris beforehand.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:17.240
Webinar format just freaks me out because it is nowhere even

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.800
remotely aligned with my style.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.220
When I'm doing a presentation, I need, I need a sense of,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.340
am I losing my audience or not?

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.100
It is definitely hard.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.540
I've done a bunch of them and I'm a little better at them now

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.500
and just not caring or imagining, but it is hard to not get.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:43.740
See, if you see confusion or I are nodding heads, those things help.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.690
I can, I can tell if they're pretending my jokes are funny.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.950
Most are. Yeah.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:57.350
The thing I was thinking, though, next time I do a webinar,

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.880
what I could just do is I could just sit in my home, record it.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.520
There's plenty of apps for that.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.080
And then when it's time for the webinar, I just hit play.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.410
Then I can practice it 10, 15 times and get it right.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.280
Cool. Hey, speaking of webinars, the tangent road will return back to conferences.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.920
But speaking of conferences, the I don't know if the dates are announced yet,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.640
but Brent and I will be presenting something to be determined

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.960
at the next online test conference for Joel sometime in the summer.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.200
I forget when it is, but we're going to do something

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.560
and we're going to figure out what that is at a later date.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.380
Maybe episode 100. Maybe.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.020
By the way, episode I'm never going to get back to conferences,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.060
but it's something I want to talk about.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.460
So I'm going back to webinars. OK.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.860
And then I'll close on this very quickly.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.620
And that is if you're the type that tries to fast forward through the banter.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.100
I'm sorry that we're still talking and not on.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.140
This is important stuff, too. So you may like it.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.100
It's interesting on the webinar as well.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.380
So I don't know if you are how you deal with this.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.420
So that content, right, even when I presented it, it was

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.300
it was heavily influenced by the Unity deck a year ago

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.260
when I presented for your team.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:17.660
I modified it a great deal because of what I think the audience wants.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.460
But the other thing, too, is I can't tell if I'm too high level

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.980
or too low level for the audience.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.700
I get this is a space where for me, I've been babbling about it.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.780
It seems like four years.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.700
And I don't know how much of the audience is still at phase zero.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.310
Right. I'm like, OK, do I go in deep on how to move data

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.750
from place A to place B?

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.870
Or do I just skip over that and say Google it?

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.430
That's actually a really good point.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.590
One of the things one of the great takeaways from my time

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.070
in engineering excellence, right, studied a lot on how people learn

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:04.190
was you need to gauge the audience's level of experience.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.990
And speaking in person, like a lot of my talks to start off with,

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.560
how many of you have blah, a little bit more information

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.320
than how many of you have blah, blah, blah?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.480
And from a few of those questions at the beginning,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.120
near the beginning of the talk, you begin to get an idea

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.200
of where you need to make tweaks later.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.640
Yes, that's what I do.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.200
So but without that, it's like, here's my wall of information.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.800
Maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't. Good luck.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.510
I'll see you on the other side.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.830
Yeah, one of the most common questions I'll ask, like when I do

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.750
internal presentations, is how many of you have ever directly

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.060
worked with a data scientist?

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.780
Almost inevitably, every time someone raised their hand,

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.460
I'm the data scientist, the reason their hand for.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.210
And so now I just turn it into a joke.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.170
I'm like, ah, fantastic.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.730
Then none of you are likely to know when I am lying to you.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.730
Yes. And I can I can vouch for that.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.570
I've heard I've heard Brent use that line. That happens.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.890
Yeah. So back up the stack.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.450
I think we're done with that. Conferences.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.290
Can I go back to conferences?

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.090
So one thing on one of the three.slack.com

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.210
you can get an you can get the invitation link at modern

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.890
testing.org is someone who I've ever forgotten

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:24.650
posted a talk, a video of a actually I watched

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.290
a pretty good talk from JS conference, JavaScript conference.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.650
And then Tony, I remember Tony because I met Tony.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.010
If I met if I met you, I remember who when you say things, Tony

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.810
pointed out that he heard me say a lot of those things

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.530
in same things in Philadelphia at Test Bash a couple of years ago,

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.140
two and a half years ago.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.700
Not that I'm not at all.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.060
I mean, nothing I say is so new that I like, oh, my gosh,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.220
somebody else is saying this.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.220
But the cool thing is that the point I wanted to make that is

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.060
if there are dev conferences where people are saying

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.300
a lot of the things I'm saying, that is my next venue.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.740
When I get back into speaking, I want to start speaking more

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.460
at developer conferences about modern testing, about quality,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.790
about quality engineering teams and not do that as much

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.590
at test conferences.

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.710
Test Bash still has a place in my heart.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.270
And I will probably be the only the only test conference

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.630
that I want to speak at again is Test Bash and online test conference

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.070
online stuff I'll do till the cows come home

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.910
because I can sit in my home where pants optional

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.310
and talk about whatever.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.510
But as far as conferences to go to, I really like not just as a speaker,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.830
but as an attendee, big fan of Test Bash.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.350
But other than that, I'd like to.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.470
My future plans are to see if I can talk about some of the things

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.190
I like to talk about and do it for a developer audience,

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.510
because I think the world is ready for that.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.070
I think not the world is ready for me.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.950
The world that the software development world is ready

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.630
for the things that I've been talking about because they're already

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.990
talking about them.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:09.270
No, I think I think developer and or DevOps

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.550
conferences are actually the right place for it to be.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.660
Yeah. Right.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.780
So we should talk a little bit about the cliffhanger in ninety seven.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.160
What happens after modern testing and postmodern testing?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.320
Postmodern testing is the answer.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.750
You are absolutely correct, Sir.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.230
Brian Jensen. Thanks.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.590
So I think it's in general, the answer is different for everyone.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.990
And people worry about like, what if I do work myself out of a job?

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.790
My theory, my hypothesis is in my experience,

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.030
which I'll share a little bit about in a moment, is that

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.110
in the process of leading a team towards following modern testing principles,

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.170
there will come a point when.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.530
Principle number seven, you may not need a dedicated testing specialist,

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.170
but along that way, you've learned a lot of other skills.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.210
No skills are going to be different for every single person.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.090
Talk about the T-shaped persona and breadth.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.770
Well, hopefully, I mean,

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.060
if you just this is why we had the principle

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.220
or the not principle eight discussion.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.740
Right. Hopefully, as you've as you've gone through,

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.100
you have also invested in in yourself

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.900
so that you're ready for a postmodern transition.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.580
Yeah. And if you think about the things you need to do,

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.100
there's a lot of leadership exercise, whether you're an individual contributor

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.860
or in a management position, there's a lot of

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.710
demonstratable assets from your work.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.470
People see if you're have led a team along that direction.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.310
I would think that people will be looking for you

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.710
to do a bunch of different things.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.350
I was joking with one of the dev managers in Montreal

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.270
this week, because I talk a little bit about what I'm doing,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.390
but what I'm actually doing hasn't been announced yet.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.510
So and it may or may not be by Monday when the podcast goes out.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.670
So I'm going to speak a little bit in broader terms.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.190
And we'll go into details in ninety nine.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.270
But I was joking with one of the dev managers.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.870
So do you know what you're doing next?

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.580
And the reason he asked that is more context.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.780
We're doing a reorg.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.300
We have a new general manager for our vice president

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.380
slash vice president for our cloud new cloud division.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.520
And we're doing some reorganization as part of that.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.880
As part of that, I am eliminating the remaining people on my team.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.400
My team, I have gone from a high of just below 50 people

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.480
in my test organization.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.760
Right now I have I just moved my last lead reporting to me

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:57.160
to another division and I have 10 IC reporting to me right now.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.640
But as part of this reorg, I am removing all of them

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.680
from my org and dissolving my cost center.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.620
Bum bum.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.780
Some people may look at that and like I've had people go

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.060
what the F is wrong with you?

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.220
You're stupid.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.420
People are power.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.740
You need your organization.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.740
I said and it's tough for me because I yeah having getting

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.020
rid of my organization is a scary thing.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.300
But business wise and my priority is improving the business.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.660
It is a more efficient way to run all of those orgs.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.420
I have made sure I've done a lot of work to make sure

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.660
they're going to land well.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.060
They're in orgs I trust.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.780
I've done all kinds of handoff.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.380
It's the right thing to do and it's going to work out.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.300
So what does that mean for me?

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.540
Because nothing's announced.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.620
Nobody really knows yet.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.260
I've had a lot of discussions with my new manager about

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.700
kind of what the role looks like.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.030
And the joke with one of the development managers in

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.670
Montreal was which was actually good to hear.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.110
He said so what are you going to do?

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.310
And I said I don't know.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.910
I mean I have some ideas but nothing's announced so we're

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.790
still working it out.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.190
I'm probably not going to get fired because if you're fired

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:10.870
I will hire you right away.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.630
So it's good to hear.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.390
It's like it's like I've established that you establish

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.230
that credibility.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.110
So I still defining what the role is.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.230
You wouldn't be fired though.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.830
Yeah.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.350
Well who knows.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.550
Laid off.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:25.830
Yeah it would be laid off.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.230
OK there we go.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.350
We'll talk more in details later.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.710
I'm sorry I thought when I made the cliffhanger three

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.390
weeks ago that a lot more would have rolled through but

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.670
a lot of things happening going on slowed things down a

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:42.430
little bit. But definitely in a much broader scope role

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.190
across the organization which is good not leading

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.540
testers most likely leading another part of the

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.340
organization and in a role where I can ensure that

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.140
modern testing principles continue throughout the

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.140
organization which is kind of fun to do from a non QA

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.620
lead test lead position.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.830
I've gone through the stages.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.830
It's not the same as seven stages of grief.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.270
I went through nervous.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.350
Oh my God this sounds really hard to excited.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.110
Oh but I can do this too anxious.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.230
I want to get started.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.550
And then in limbo here for a while I kind of like like

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.870
maybe anxious and frustrated a little bit on come on.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.870
Let's just move forward.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.430
But it's all the detail.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.430
So we kind of know what the role is as far as

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.270
position in the organization.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.230
But as my manager and I have developed a bit of a

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.590
relationship figuring out well what other is

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.390
actually really good.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.190
I've never had a position where or a manager where

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.910
we're not just looking at what do you what's the

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.870
role you're going to do.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.790
But what does that role grow into and how do you

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.950
and we've even had the conversation because I've

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.590
done this with testing.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.750
It's like what would happen if you if in this

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.750
role you worked yourself out of the out of the

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.710
out of a role not a job out of a role and

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:02.470
figure out what's next.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.350
Kind of making sure it's all set up for those

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.150
things to work out.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.630
So that's kind of and I'm sorry to not have a

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.230
great answer to the cliffhanger to kind of one

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.670
of those like soap opera things where you get the

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.990
cliffhanger then in the next episode you don't

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.910
really get the answer but you just kind of get

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.630
strong on a little bit more.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.270
That's kind of what we're doing here just so I

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.030
don't because it would be awkward right.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.270
If I said I'm doing this job and then I put

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.350
podcast on Monday people go people listen to the

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.310
podcast is the weird thing I've mentioned

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.150
before about unity is didn't happen at Microsoft.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.030
People in my organization people I know listen

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.670
to the podcast in fact like not just testers the

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.510
developers someone pointed out like it comes up.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.580
Odd it's kind of embarrassing for me because I'm

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.500
used to having a podcast that nobody actually see

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.900
often or or who has who whose opinion matters

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.380
of me.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.780
Here's the podcast.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.060
Yeah nothing against the three your opinions do

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.660
matter to me but I'll just see a random direct

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.780
consequence like I'll be in a discussion talking

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.100
about some things we're doing and then some

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.900
random developer and another team will say oh

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.380
yeah Alan talked about that on his podcast and

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.860
it kind of freaks me out a little bit.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.980
It kind of it's kind of awkward not like it's I

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.860
don't know why it's awkward anyway I've been

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.420
talking for a while any thoughts or reactions or

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:27.940
questions.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.300
First off first off I would like to know the

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.020
name of the developer in unity that that in a

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.980
public meeting tells you hey Alan Brent would

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.060
not approve of that.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.700
I'd like to know their name I'll go take them to

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.180
coffee.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.300
Yeah I haven't heard that yet.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.420
Not yet but now coffees on the line.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:54.770
Well it's good you broaden that to how do you

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.330
get that guy Brent to shut up.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.590
Could that be a question that would earn them

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.310
coffee. No OK no. So any any praise for what I

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.710
am trying to do is figure out a way that I can

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.630
use the podcast to continue to torture you in

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.390
your day to day work like. Yeah yeah yeah.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.200
You can tell them secrets. I don't really have

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.260
any though. Alan hates tequila. Whatever you do

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.580
don't give him tequila. Right. No he does. He

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.380
hates it tremendously.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.540
Yeah I get where Alan's coming from. You've got

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.740
to think about the business. The thing is is

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:40.900
while they're working through plans and I do

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.700
have a little bit more of a sense than what

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.820
Alan's describing of what is going to happen to

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.500
him. I'll tell him I'll tell you guys what I

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.380
told him which is dude that is sweet. I'm sure

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.220
it is scaring the crap out of you right now.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.780
But once you get in it'll be awesome. It'll just

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.780
be a matter of time. Yep I think so. That's

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.580
exactly it. When I first got an idea the scope

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.500
of the role I was quite scared. I said nervous

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.060
but maybe scared is right. But I thought the

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.500
more I thought through it the better I felt

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:24.300
and the more I've I've talked to people in a

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.260
little different way. We'll be able to talk

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.020
about this a little bit more later but I'm

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.060
settling into it even though it's not official.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.560
And what's really interesting is the reaction

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.080
from my team as I move them out of their QA

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.880
roles working for me and to working within

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.840
their dev teams in a specialist role. And also

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.800
keep in mind that these people aren't doing

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.960
test things all day. And in fact we just had

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.360
our we had these three times a year discussions

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.920
at Unity called three keys three questions

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.760
about what is your mission at Unity. What are

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.320
you doing and how are you doing and just kind

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.400
of talk about just a reflective discussion

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.640
around career development what's going on. And

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.360
as I talk to people the amount of leadership

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.840
and influence and building and their focus on

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.480
building a quality culture is like yeah we're

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.640
fine. And I get from the development leads

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.160
these guys work with I get nothing but praise

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.040
and the fact that most of them are doing at

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.800
the very least things that would be that would

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.520
fall into the DevOps category and some full

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.320
on writing features as well as their testing

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:40.680
work. The confidence that the teams have with

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.840
them. I feel really good. There's one person on

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.320
my team. I'm going to have another talk with

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.920
them today is a little nervous about the

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.370
change. But the thing is I'm not leaving the

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.290
org and the other part is nobody's nervous

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:56.010
about oh my God is Alan leaving getting fired.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:00.290
They just they which is weird. I'd like a

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.890
little bit more concerned over my career

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.850
given all the turmoil but whatever. I think

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.890
they feel like I'll land somewhere good and

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.910
they're right. But really all those ICS on

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.470
my team only one is a little nervous but I

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.870
think once the change actually happens and

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:23.150
they realize how little things are actually

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.950
changing because my influence is still there.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:29.110
I will still meet with the dev managers

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.230
around the org. In fact when we do hiring in

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.550
these places for hiring more people as a test

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.150
specialist or a primary test specialist they

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.190
all be involved in hiring and job descriptions

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:44.150
et cetera. So it will be it should be very

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.910
should be noticeable very little that I'm in a

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.350
different role and there's no more QA

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.190
organization in the cloud org. I want to go

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.710
to a mailbag question I totally forgot to

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.570
do our last mailbag show. We can't fit them all

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.330
in or I can I didn't just forget to put

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:10.020
something we could. I can't tell that's an

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.620
I don't have my glasses that Aiden Boyd

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.380
could be all Aiden Aiden Boyd. Sorry.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.500
Question for you Brent. I'll answer to how

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.700
much weight would you say clear leadership

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.580
direction holds when it comes to growing a

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.060
quality culture. Oh I'll probably have an

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.020
answer for this too. I am fortunate enough

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.020
to work in a delivery team where I am

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.620
confident that with time and many robust

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.940
but constructive conversations we can move

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.940
ourselves up the scale for most of the

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.260
quality culture capabilities. However

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.400
despite the healthy relationships and

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.000
generally positive attitude towards quality

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.240
within the delivery team there are no

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.600
clear company goals or metrics that we can

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.080
evaluate ourselves against. Is this

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.880
something we should seek out in order to

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.120
give us a stronger drive for quality and a

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:06.220
clearer sense of direction. Yes. No. It

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.740
depends. No. This one does not depend.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.820
However despite. All right. So I'm reading

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.900
at the same time I'm glad I loaded it up

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.590
because I would have remembered three words

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.910
from that. How much weight would you say

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:27.010
clear leadership direction holds when it

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:31.650
comes to growing a quality culture. How

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.950
much. What do you think clear leadership

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:41.140
direction means. I think a vision. As the

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.300
question evolves its goals I think he's

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.460
saying should leadership provide quality

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.660
goals that the team tries to achieve.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.970
How much how important is that. Yeah I

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.350
kind of interpret. However let me go to

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.750
the next thing because I think I

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.310
interpret this differently. However

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.110
despite the healthy relationships and

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.750
generally positive attitude towards

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.590
quality within the delivery team there

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:07.350
are no clear company goals or metrics

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.150
that we can use to evaluate ourselves

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.350
against. So that's the thing that

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.400
bothers me because what I hear is it

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.200
sounds like he's in a DevOps role. Did

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.920
I do that right. Yeah I'm not certain

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.440
what role he's in delivery team he

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.890
delivers babies. Okay if you don't know

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.170
where you're going any road will take

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:37.710
you there. So yeah you need to have. I

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.230
am a firm believer that you need to have

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.510
both qualitative and quantitative

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:49.300
definition of success. Right. If you're in

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.800
a role or if you're in a team how do

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.400
you define success. How do you how one

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.160
of the things I believe as a business

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.480
leader is I'm morally obligated to inform

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.850
my management when they no longer need

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.210
my team and should get rid of it. Right

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:16.300
but to me it is it is a vision statement

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.620
it is a goal that helps you to be

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.540
well efficient lean understand success

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.340
failure these are all important. Well

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.460
let's go back to the leadership row of

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.250
my quality culture transition guide

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.010
where it starts off with there's no

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.320
leadership support and then leadership

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.920
drives quality via metrics and score

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.840
cards right to leadership sets

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.520
principles and a clear vision and

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.430
then the most mature level is

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.190
leadership can mostly stay the heck out

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.510
of the way because the team has

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.950
internalized all those things. Even

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.130
further I think the final step is

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:03.370
leadership agrees with the principles

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:07.530
and visions set by the team. Yes so I

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.050
think leadership needs to be involved I

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.210
mean you can have some overarching goals

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.050
it's easy to fall from that third level

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.370
to that second level. And I want to be

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.490
careful about talking about leadership

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.130
versus management here. Yeah. I think

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.210
we're talking about management. Well we're

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.090
talking about whoever's sitting the

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:28.370
vision for the team. Right. Having a set

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.850
of specific goals defined for everyone

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.770
in the company around quality everyone

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.290
must have 80 percent code coverage.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.850
Those things those are more of the how

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.120
having a high level of code coverage

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.080
reduces some risk so that'd be a how

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.400
I'd achieve a leadership goal of we want

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.310
four nines of uptime this year. We want

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.150
to lose less than ten thousand dollars

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.030
on revenue due to site being down.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.750
Whatever right. Those are high level

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.990
goals those things below those a lot of

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.710
those quality culture bits are the how

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.830
you achieve that. And that vision can

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.750
just also help you determine how much

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.670
weight to put into different aspects of

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.510
the quality culture. When another thing

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.190
I reading between the lines on Aidan's

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.470
post is you know our team has a good

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.390
quality culture. He doesn't say anything

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.630
about other teams but I wonder if

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.270
between the lines and Aidan you can chime

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.190
in on slack if I'm kind of reading like

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.790
our team has high quality culture

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.350
principles but maybe other teams don't

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.710
I think they don't because leadership

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.390
doesn't have any goals in place. I

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.510
don't know if that's the case or not

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.910
but I kind of felt that a little bit

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.700
and it can be painful if your team

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.410
takes a lot of time on the how that

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:42.650
quality culture putting a lot of

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.370
effort into learning and improvement

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.290
and trying to do everything much better

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.210
all the time and you have some other

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:51.210
teams that don't have those same values

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.490
it's very easy in a lot of cases to say

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.770
well this is a leadership needs to

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.970
establish some goals so we're all on the

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.610
same page which actually isn't a horrible

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.130
idea but it's not the only way to get

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.930
every team on the same page as far as

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.770
quality culture goes. Can you from your

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.610
experience can you generalize let's

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.970
say you take two teams. Mm-hmm. Would

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.570
you be how would you go about

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.790
enumerating let's say team A in your

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:22.130
opinion has a better quality culture than

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:27.420
team B right. Okay. What might be things

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.900
that you would enumerate like obviously

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.980
that's going to be a multi scaler or

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.380
multi valued thing. That's actually

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.740
largely why I created that quality

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.060
culture transition guide as a way to to

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.060
have a conversation not to score a team

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.140
because I hate score cards that I hate

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.860
maturity models because they're used to

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.700
score cards but I use that grid as a

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.740
discussion point to talk with the team

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.400
on how they approach quality and what

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.960
are some areas they may need to improve

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.840
and would and tied into areas of risk

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.480
it I use that as a tool a lot in

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.120
retrospectives as a place to discover

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.600
places where a team may want to improve

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.200
so that's I don't know if I answer

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.440
your question directly but that's

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.360
well ask ask me again in a different

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.480
way. So what I read from Aidan's

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.760
post is is hey there are no clear goals

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.710
or metrics here right and it's it's

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.950
because number one we're talking about

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.310
culture which is hard to measure.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.950
Number two we're talking about quality

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.950
culture which makes it even harder to

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.780
measure when it comes to measurements

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.580
though what what people generally do

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.960
is they they want to get a sense if

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.640
we can't measure it concretely can we

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.840
measure it relativistically so that we

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.680
can learn from others I do agree that I

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.600
do not like scorecards of this sense if

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.520
they're going to be used punitively but

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.170
if they're going to be used as hey on

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.370
lever number one team a is better on

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.450
quality culture and lever number two

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:12.050
team B right it then it helps to

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.810
encourage knowledge sharing so that

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.930
both teams can grow together that yeah

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.530
trick is to measure it without creating

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:24.330
competition or wrongly using Hawthorne's

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:29.330
effect yeah I I would definitely solve

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.490
the problem via sharing and celebrating

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.570
success to be more concrete let's say

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:39.250
team a is fantastic at retrospectives

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.650
and every single sprint they pick one

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.170
or two things they want to improve and

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.210
they get better and I'm going to

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.650
celebrate that because I want to team

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.410
B is not doing that I want to see how

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.450
much that's helping them even if team B

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.050
is better overall and then team B may

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.130
have they may have put together a

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.770
fantastic suite of tools and checks

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.610
and their CI system date of the art I

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.210
want to share and celebrate that and

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.370
get team team a may go oh we didn't

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.210
know we had that problem but yeah if

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.730
we borrow this we can do that so I

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:12.250
want to actually leverage the strengths

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.970
of each team to make the other team

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.610
better I love celebrating success yeah I

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.250
think it's very motivating I don't think

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.370
to two agents questions I don't and I

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:24.170
completely agree by the way I don't

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.050
think this is something that you can

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.330
you can really succeed with with a with

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:35.910
a with a hard fast quantitative measure

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:39.270
this is does not contradict the

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.910
statement I would said just a few

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:45.810
minutes ago though because you do need

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.490
you do need that to help guide and

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.210
measure and and show improvement in a

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.680
in a in a real sense I'll tell you a

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.640
problem that I have that's related to

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.760
something that you just mentioned

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.320
retrospective so here in Azure we have

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.540
a big retrospective process not in the

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.140
sense that we talk about with a small

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.300
agile team you can think of it closer

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.740
to like a old-school post-mortem process

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.620
but that process says in certain

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.420
instances you are required to file bugs

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.220
to prevent this from occurring again

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:27.720
okay whatever the this is I'm off you

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.160
skating on purpose and I knee-deep in a

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.060
lot of these conversations the issue I

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.980
have though is from a data science

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.900
point of view I am trying to figure out

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.540
a way are we just telling people to do

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.770
activity or is there any evidence that

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.860
this activity is actually helping right

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.100
because we don't have so let's say you

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.500
have a monitor here's an example let's

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.590
say you had an outage and and it took

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.470
you three days to respond because you

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.230
didn't have a monitor for it your

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.230
customer actually got impacted and

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:13.520
called in now you go you build that

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:19.180
monitor but that three-day outage is a

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:23.840
one-in-a-lifetime event sharks slam into

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.200
something that caused power to go out

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.480
right and we didn't detect it right that

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.720
two months that they used to build that

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.360
monitor yeah so a quick story that I

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.880
want to get to the closing here is

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.540
that's a common problem in engineering

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.740
off often we will over optimize on the

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.180
edge case not just for monitoring I saw

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.780
it recently internally I'm not going to

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.820
tell any details but a bunch of smart

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.340
people got together to review how

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.340
something was going and they started

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.260
thinking of these bizarre edge cases

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.140
next thing you know a team is like

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.300
trying to write a bunch of code to

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.900
solve these bizarre edge cases it's like

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:12.190
stop stop stop stop stop no this is

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.790
never going to happen it would be why

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:16.230
don't we just prevent people from trying

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.190
to do this stupid edge case versus

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.870
trying to enable this thing that is

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.070
theoretically possible but will likely

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.910
very likely never happen in a million

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.830
gazillion years the the thing is it's

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.230
fascinating and to be fair I love

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.510
their thinking of edge cases because

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.470
that's that's that systems thinking you

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.750
know but you have to actually

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.310
think about it from a risk perspective

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.550
as well and once you know the edge cases

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:45.590
you got to think around okay how do we

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.950
generalize these things into a different

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.950
group like I like like the suggestion of

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:53.350
oh turns out if we turn off this whole

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:56.620
menu item all of these edge cases go

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.500
away yes there's a couple of feature

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.460
take backs but but you know no one uses

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.460
those we need to help the move from

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.500
testing specialist or risk specialist

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.420
we need people that can look at the

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.740
bigger picture that if I risk versus

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.900
think of new test ideas yes and actually

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.620
so multiple times on the podcast I've

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.580
detailed a bunch of insights I've learned

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.740
when I went to Bing okay there's when

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.940
you're in that space it's a game

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.540
changer testing does not make sense in

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.700
the context we're used to and Bing

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.260
everything changes every second oh my

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.340
god are you saying testing is dead

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.480
moving on oh my god here you here in

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.500
Azure there is a different phenomenon

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:51.510
edge cases suddenly impact thousands of

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:57.000
people because things are we are so

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.440
popular we have so many different

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.480
widgets running in the cloud and the

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:07.110
system is extremely flexible even the

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.430
case it only happens point one percent

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.940
of the time is a large number of

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:19.110
important things impacted yeah there's a

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.220
real problem there what I keep

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.220
thinking through is okay on I always go

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:31.920
back to ROI what is if we if we try

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.960
to define quality or our quality culture

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.880
we need to invest in terms of some sort

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.150
of return on investment and so yeah if you

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:49.190
can't measure return that at minimum

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.270
needs to be fixed in terms of metrics

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.310
and goals for a for a quality culture

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.590
sure it can be anyway yeah yes I agree

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.990
one last thing I want to talk about

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:03.870
before we go is the upcoming episode 100

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.930
of a be testing someday soon someday

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.770
soon about a month which will as my if

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.450
I look at my math correctly when I get

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.010
the date exactly right but will also

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:18.410
remarkably happen very very very close to

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.690
the five-year anniversary of the AB

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.770
testing podcast of episode one which if

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.690
you go back and listen is a piece of

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:30.340
junk it's awful some people want to go

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.100
back and start at one for completion and

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.620
I tell you stop starting the 40s or

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.500
somewhere we could turn one into like a

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.220
two-year prequel and just reset the

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:45.940
nut up I am toying with the idea of a

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.660
call-in show for episode 100 I am going

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.540
to gauge interest among the three I'll

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.140
also ask on Twitter will try and get a

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.380
date set of definitely a few weeks in

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.940
advance I'll work it out with Brent we

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.460
do a little bit of a longer recording

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.420
time I think I can pull it off I'm gonna

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.060
do a little bit of technical work in

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.140
between but if you're interested in

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.220
being part of that show please ping me on

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.220
Twitter ping me an email ping me on our

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.660
slack team and we'll try and find some

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.980
times that work it'll be awkward if

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.740
like only one person dials in but I

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.300
thought it'd be fun give it a shot I

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.900
have no idea how it will work it's

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.780
probably stupid to do such a big

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.820
experiment for for such a milestone

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.660
episode but then I could just call it if

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.540
it fails I can call it 99 a if we're

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.780
gonna fail let's fail glory you know I

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.380
was talking to someone on my team

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.740
recently and he said the team's being

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.540
really paranoid very caught they're

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.380
being says being overly cautious about

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.620
releases and I said that team that

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.740
product they need to screw up more

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.520
and he nodded his head like is the the

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.280
test room a team yeah so they need to

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.680
the testing specialist who's actually

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.360
doing mostly DevOps work said you're

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.200
the team is just you're not learning if

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.240
you're not screwing up mess some things

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.880
up practice rollback don't be so darn

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.400
paranoid just f things up a little bit

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.720
and it got the message I mean it's

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.040
probably a little bit over the top but

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.760
but yeah we should screw it up just so

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.600
we can learn what works and what

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.580
doesn't yes all right man yes good

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.900
hanging out with you again I look

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.900
forward to doing 99 sometime soon couple

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.500
weeks talk a little bit more about my

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.100
new role if it's still not defined in

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.700
two weeks then well we'll be par for the

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.180
course I've been in limbo for a while

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.380
trying to get things finalized but

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.140
hopefully we get it worked out all

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.980
right I'm still Alan I'm Brent and

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.340
I'm not Brent and I'm not Alan all

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.620
right bye
