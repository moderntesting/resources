WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
Approaching a test today would not be to test quality in like I did when I started is to understand what quality is and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.000
Recognize the gap between what we're doing and what that is

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.550
Welcome to a be testing podcast your modern testing podcast

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.350
Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.590
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey everybody, it's Alan and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.950
Brent and it's a be testing podcast

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.640
You didn't tell me we were gonna do like the monster truck

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.400
Podcast come in this

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.920
Monday Monday Monday. Yeah

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.720
165 165 165. All right, so everybody's awake. I'm sorry

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.880
I'll tone that down and post prod as they say, but we're here again to talk about

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.650
Yeah, who knows really right Brett? What do you been up to? Are you watching the fun and politics on this fine Friday?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.110
I'm kind of

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.110
Sick of the politics right now

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.350
Yes and no, but I was thinking of a podcast episode

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420
Right. Yeah, and I was just thinking

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.110
man

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.390
to me the politics are extra political and

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.070
I was thinking about how we've talked about

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.310
Really in America. I think you agree with us really in America the fact that we're a two-party system

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550
Oh God friggin blows and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.260
Right now I kind of see the two parties in dominant are

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.340
Both trying to make it a single party

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.470
Yeah, and I'm just like this this

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.150
As you know, I am neither of the the popular party

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.030
No, but it doesn't help to be neither

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.230
It doesn't help to be neither until we have ranked choice voting and then people can be neither it can make a difference

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.270
No, because then yes, then you're asking me to be the enabler and join the two-party system

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.150
Be all freaking least go I'm a liberalist or

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.990
Whatever it is and I'm gonna vote for my candidate and I'm net my candidates never gonna win because we have a hostile two-party

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.110
System, but I have my principles you tell me how

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.790
How throwing in with one of the stupid two parties that is what today to be?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.990
How does that help it become a three-party or a four or a five because today no matter what one of the stupid two

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.670
parties is going to win people like me who may want to vote for another party are afraid to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.990
We don't want our vote to not count. We don't want the worst of two evils to get into the office

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.990
Okay, so more more

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.070
Because you're afraid you want me to join your idiocy

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.430
Is that what you just told me no bullshit you're wasting a vote

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.510
You're sending a vote to someone who is not going to win and then that vote just gets flushed down the toilet

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.830
Doesn't matter for anything else. I want you to continue to vote for your little party of that that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
aligns with your principles. I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.150
Do not want I want to do this

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.910
I want to vote for whatever party aligns my principles, but when an inevitably at least at first that candidate doesn't win

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.070
it doesn't let a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.860
for example a

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.020
Person convicted of espionage and selling new potentially selling nuclear secrets from getting into power

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.020
But if we all vote for the party that wins we have exactly the opposite of what I want

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.900
So your logic

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.460
No, my my logic you're saying you're saying that if I vote for my principles. Yep knowing that

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.700
My party is not gonna win

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.700
Because eventually if enough people vote for your like you vote for your principles people get more and more comfortable voting for that person

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.540
party will get more

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.340
dollars to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.660
Campaign and become a little bit more prominent get their voice heard more than they do today

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.340
Which ends up letting these third and fourth parties rise into prominence

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.620
Well, it sounds like then I should you're reversing that I should continue to vote the way I do

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.820
You're not gonna get the momentum. You need to challenge the two-party system without ranked by sorting. Well, I agree

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.740
But okay done then which of the two parties are gonna give me that

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.290
none of the other party because they both

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.630
Desperately want to stay in power and be in power and be the power so we're never gonna have ranked choice voting

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.050
We are always going to have better candidates than the two

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.370
Democrat and Republican I'm so sorry everybody but you didn't get this anyway

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:21.270
We're always gonna have better candidates far better candidates than what the Democratic and Republican parties put out there always always till the end of time

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.930
Yes

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.330
Unfortunately, that's the only choice we really have we can vote for other people and feel better about it

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.490
But no matter who we vote for either the Republican or the Democrat is going to win any political race

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.210
Did you see in the latest latest voter pamphlet for Washington? There was somebody running? I forget which office

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.450
I almost voted for him, but I chickened that up last minute. His party was the elven way

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.030
I

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.980
Mean, you know what? This is where we gotta go

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.960
We got to get to a place where if I feel like voting for the elven way

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.860
I can vote for the elven way and they have a chance of winning

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.660
But today we'll go all vote for the party with the best chance of winning and I'll be yeah

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.060
No, so I'm not gonna do that. I mean I would have voted for the elven way guy if

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.740
If his principles were aligned a little bit of a rant there

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.180
We're about seven minutes in but we'll get on

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.420
What?

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.540
Well, I was just thinking the I we didn't have much time

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.660
Post said it last time, but I gotta say I really enjoyed our our last guest

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.620
Yeah, he was fun and I feel bad one of our listeners pinged us and was a little bummed

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.340
He said hey, I listen to the first 10 minutes sound like an ad so I left and it did turn out that we talked

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.940
About his product at the beginning, but by no means was it like it really wasn't about his product at all

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.280
No, although we did talk about it at the beginning just kind of because it no man set some context

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.600
What happens is you want to be on the podcast you somehow internet stalk me and you go?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.520
Hey, can this dude? I know beyond the podcast or this can I be on the podcast and I'm

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.600
Yeah, sure, whatever and then we then we get to know the person on the podcast and we talk and yeah, it was fun

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.400
You're gonna say something. Yeah, I was gonna say no

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.240
I mean it made sense it to me it makes sense for us to talk about their product very because our job is to convert the

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.200
Conversation to something that we think is gonna be interesting to our listeners or just what we want to talk about

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.800
Yeah, but if we have a guest on right, I'm gonna want to talk about their product

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.120
Because then I'm then I'm kind of probing to figure out what okay

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.280
What are these guys or what is this person a domain expert on that's interesting to our listeners? Ah

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.620
Yeah, right and I didn't think it were 10 minutes in like like I thought we had it pretty quickly

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.910
All right

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:55.630
Yeah, this leadership is disappointing people at a level they can absorb a mens

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.870
All right

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.990
Okay, anything else you want to hit on before we give you a topic?

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.110
No, let's that's that's top

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:11.990
All right, I was recently to a couple things going on here and I'm gonna be very transparent about what's going on here

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.910
I am super lazy. Did you know that Brent? I did

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:23.110
This is why I automate stuff and by that I don't mean writing Selenium tests. So stuff it I am

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:30.870
Superly so slimy Selenium tests. We've covered this Selenium test is is is the opposite of lazy

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.070
Let me give you an example how lazy I am

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.710
Okay, my I was new monitor, but it's a little screwed up in power management

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.550
When I plug it in in the morning

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.660
It doesn't turn it doesn't connect it like my my Mac thinks it's there

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.660
But it's not there and I have to well used to have to unplug it and plug it back in

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.620
Okay, and it would work fine the whole rest of the day just after being off for a while

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.620
It won't plug back in kind of a pain

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:04.980
Well, I am way too lazy to crawl under my desk every morning and unplug and plug in my monitor

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:13.660
so I put a little internet addressable plug on the monitor and then put that on a timer so it turns off and on

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.020
about 10 minutes for my first meeting in the morning and

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.080
That's how lazy I am

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.960
To me it feels like a YouTube word of the life hack

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.000
Lazy someone asked me

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.560
Recently like would you write? Can you write you know, I write articles once for a while

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.120
I said, yeah, I think I'd like to write an article

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.240
It's been a while and I said you have a suggestion because man, I don't even know where to start that

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.720
I haven't already ranted about how the way how we test at unity

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.500
No, that isn't in my list I did repost someone on Twitter post

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:57.080
I saw another I just glanced by another one saying someone with the testers mindset could blah blah blah

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.320
So I reposted my myth of the testers mindset thing on Twitter last week

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.240
Yeah, we got a got a few few head nods and yeah, ha's and that kind of stuff

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.160
But anyway, they're right another article

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.160
I asked for a suggestion and then which I'll share here in a second and then

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.480
Another company asked me if I do a talk like a recorded like 10-minute talk, which I can usually spit those out pretty quickly

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.440
But I'm gonna do

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.500
The same time in a read an article about something and then I'm gonna talk on the same

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.370
thing and

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.910
Because I'm way lazy and I should say in college every once in a while

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.530
I would get an assignment from two different classes that was close enough like a writing assignment

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:45.650
I could do the same paper for two different classes. Now. It's not plagiarism if it's plagiarizing you

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:52.130
Major me ism. So I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write a paper probably this weekend. I'm gonna give a talk

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.650
I'm probably gonna record it

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.530
Next week, but we're gonna go ahead and kind of hash out the topic today

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.800
We have this more than a couple times

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.100
We have we have like vet my topic

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.240
But I have some ideas here and I want to walk through kind of what I'm thinking about but I want to get your

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.360
Initial reaction first to the topic of if I was starting as a tester today

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.970
How would I approach it and I want to get your initial thoughts and then I have a whole bunch of thoughts

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:29.290
It's gonna go somewhere. So like Brent if I'm gonna ask you if you were starting as a tester today, how would you approach it?

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.320
Okay

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.840
first question

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.880
What's a tester? No, we're we're we're

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:45.400
question you said starting as a tester, but I assume I assume we're gonna go with sort of a straight out of college type of

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.280
No, no, no, I think up to interpretation

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.900
So I think my question while you think about this my question of what is a tester is a valid question because

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.200
Today if you look at the people who have a tester role, it's a lot of different things. All right

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.180
So let me start a little bit on

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.910
Kind of what I'm thinking on my story cuz I've been a bunch of different kinds of testers and some of them haven't been

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.560
Much of testers when I first started off way back in 1993

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.930
explored applications I

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:24.970
Found errors. I reported bugs. I work with developers to understand them to show them to demo them

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.970
I did I validated things were working as expected. I used applications all those things

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:38.920
Someone who does that role even today is still called the tester, right? So when I go back and do that again, probably not

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.920
Probably not. I did that for a while and then I did a lot of API testing

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.720
I wrote a bunch of network analysis utilities and tools to help me examine fonts and

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:58.200
font rendering and bitmap rendering on Windows a lot of deep API testing not just

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.760
Automating the API but writing tools and applications that helped me understand

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.720
how

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.220
Because I was working on GDI mostly with some user

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.640
how these

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.140
user facing API is worked on Windows

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.820
So I did a lot of API testing a short story would I go be back and be that kind of tester?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.600
And the answer is no because I fully believe today that everything I did then it should be the developers job

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.120
The developers should write their own tests and there's a tester could write a few of those

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.600
But I was writing a bunch of a bunch of tests

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.800
Fortunately at that time very few of them were kind of unit testy

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.640
But I think a lot of the tests I wrote at that time still should be owned by developers

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.720
They probably could have written them better than I did for sure

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.980
And at the time to my to credit I think there's a lot of like these tools are I'm picturing them like

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.540
stuff to render code pages to dive in and look at the shading on true type fonts things like that I

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.540
Shared with developers and they kind of end up being code developed over time

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.240
But still API testing you could say my you might even say my job was a developer

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.460
Who did mostly testing versus implementing new stuff? I don't know. So after I did that

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:16.430
For a while basically is this jumping ahead a few years, but I was still a tester on a test team

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.430
I was a test architect

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:26.000
But I mostly wrote tools to help testers do better work. I wrote like test test runners

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.200
In fact, I wrote a co-wrote a CI system back in like

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.450
2001

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.330
Really stuff to help stuff. I taught developers how to write unit tests and gave them

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:44.690
Like code generation that could look at their code and figure out it stubs for some unit tests go ahead

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:51.730
Yeah, but then at that point in time, were you really still a tester? Ah, good question, right?

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.930
Good question. You know what I was doing at that time

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.490
You know what I began to do at that time for the first time in my career tag

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:05.850
I began to accelerate the achievement the shippable quality. So you were an accelerant versus a safety net

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:12.470
I think for the first time ever I began to be an accelerant versus a safety net. Yep. Yep

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.990
But I was working on a cellar primarily except for a few cases

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.730
95% of what I was doing was accelerating testers or

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:29.970
No, well the what you just described was accelerating testing. Oh, yes, but at that point only the testers did the testing

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.290
Yeah, I was trying to remember

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.730
And it's hard when you were still here at Microsoft

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.570
Was it still?

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:45.850
Was this still a place in your point of view where it was common to have a discussion with?

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:53.550
Developer if I'm doing all the unit tests, what are you doing? Yeah that that was this is yeah that happened for years

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.550
That that was gone by the time I left

00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:00.220
Okay, so this is all everything I talked to you now. We were coming

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.100
This is like my my job as a tester up to about 2003 2004

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.700
Yeah, I

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:13.160
Yeah, so I like how I like how you did the shift there into into an accelerant. I really do I'm like

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.740
Okay, so he's

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:22.140
He can now point back to a time where he actually began his journey as a

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:29.980
Modern tester if you will. Yeah, very I didn't even realize it and I knew a lot about testing and I was teaching

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.680
testing and talking about testing and techniques and

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.400
But for the most part I was focusing on accelerating the test team

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.080
But then a few years later

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.800
Eventually, I don't even know what I did on link or communicate or ever it was at the time

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.040
But when I moved to Xbox I that point I was still doing a lot of accelerating of the test team

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.340
But really more of accelerating the entire team

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:58.540
I did a lot of stuff in the build system a lot of tools for developers to use as well as testers

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.600
So I was still working as an accelerant, but in this case accelerating

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:10.260
More of the team and then I moved so so there I'm a little right when I think about I think when I think about

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.630
What do we call it our motto our mission statement?

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:22.150
Accelerate the achievement of shippable quality. Yeah, you weren't accelerate in Xbox

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.710
But just because you're on engineering systems

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:35.580
Doesn't mean you were accelerating shippable quality now me knowing me knowing you you probably were

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.460
Right, but well, I was doing things like porting app

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.200
Verifier to Xbox because I believe in the power of dynamic

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.880
Analysis tools making sure we had efficient static analysis tools in our build pipeline

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:56.800
With bugs auto assigned to people for accountability there. So it's code lots of code correctness work. I did I accelerated code correctness

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
For whatever that's worth right?

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:06.200
So and then that just naturally graduated into like what I did on teams, which was even more focusing on

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.840
Well, I did I began to do more test coaching then even on

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.560
Arcadia before then the Stupid Science Project of working with developers

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.880
I'm really helping them probably the first time I helped them do better testing maybe worth what maybe that's worth talking about

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.040
So then I spent a time in my career as a tester as a test coach

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.680
Least partially helping developers learn how to do better testing

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.870
teaching them that they don't need to have a testers mindset they can just have a growth mindset and

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.350
at the same time doing that focusing on

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.190
velocity and

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.850
Even though I didn't know them at the time indirectly working on

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:49.750
Dorometrics like cycle times getting faster at delivering and getting feedback from customers

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.030
But a little bit of coaching in there, too

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.470
Yeah, so so at that point you could say that that point I was no longer a tester

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.670
Would you say that if I was coaching testers? Do I still get to wear the tester hat if I'm coaching developers on testing?

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.130
You do but to what?

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.770
Like are we going into the weeds now in terms of your initial question? No, I want to go back to it

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.890
There's an evolution here

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.770
There's like this is where my career went and it's all based on a knowledge of testing

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.370
When I shifted into accelerating the team

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:27.890
I moved into a little different approach in how I wanted to improve quality on the team and maybe it's

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:33.530
Somewhere in there. I began to care a lot more about quality than did about testing

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.130
So if I pop back original question, I don't actually know the answer here yet

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:47.050
If I was a tester today, how would I approach it? Yeah, so I was thinking of it this way. Okay, so let's say

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.730
Let's say you just came out of college

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:57.620
Okay, and brand new you're reported to a new manager and your title is

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.020
ste

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.700
Okay, okay, and your your new manager tells you hey Alan

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:10.060
Your job is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.060
Great WTF does that mean right? That's gonna be your first question. What does that mean?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.430
How would you go about working it through this to me? I

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.590
When I think of it the other way around

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.050
it's like the

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.060
The first thing I would want to know is

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.010
Okay, shippable quality

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.590
What does that mean? How is that measured?

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.510
Right. I first need to know that to know if we achieve it

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:47.310
And then the the other part of the statement is talking about cycle time and increasing cycle time, right?

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:53.550
Well, the definition of shippable is directly tied to cycle time. I don't know if my out of college

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.430
ste

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:02.190
Persona would know that but I know that right when you and I came out of college on this one the ship date was

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.270
Sure, it had wiggle room, but the ship date was just decided

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.630
18 years ago, I'll say for me

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.590
And I have I have

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:18.990
Modern testing principles up for me. The first thing I would do is all right

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.550
Where's the customer usage data?

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.380
Right, they I'm gonna start going coming up if there isn't already an active

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.540
Definition I'm gonna start coming up with

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:38.180
What are the problems customers are trying to solve with the the data? So for me, it's it's

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.140
my role

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.050
I don't know. I think if I were straight out of college, I would view my role as far more of a

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.230
data engineer

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.990
business analyst

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.150
to try to understand the the customer and

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.080
understand we are the customer

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:07.180
Yeah, no, um, that's that to try to understand the customer. What is the value proposition?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:15.120
Where are they getting stuck? Where are they improving? Let me clarify understanding or make sure something gets clicked like I go

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.280
Yeah, you're onto something. So

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:24.400
This is approaching a test today would not be to test quality in like I did when I started is to understand

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:31.320
What quality is and recognize the gap between what we're doing and what that is. Is that where you're going? Yeah

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.280
Okay to me it would it would absolutely start with

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.140
Where you are a world-renowned

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.520
Expert, okay. I can't I just got out of college man. I just got out of college. Give me some time

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.960
No, no, no

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.780
Virtual you the real you I would start with a be testing right which is of course the podcast this

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.960
podcast and so a

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.960
slash

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.760
But where you are an acknowledged world leader

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.620
Like go with your wheelhouse

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:14.490
This is actually huge. This is something maybe we've been missing talking about coming out of this is like if I'm able to

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.080
Look at data

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.350
Maybe even talk to product at customer insights

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:26.290
But the more I can understand about what customer perceived quality is

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.130
The more I can assess what our gaps are now. That's is that a

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.760
tester job

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.160
Usually it's like a product manager that drives

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.880
A-B testing

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.160
so is this an adjunct of

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.680
traditional product management or I think the new tester role is to because when I

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:55.720
Remember for there was a while once why I confused you by actually knowing some of the right nomenclature and definitions and wording around

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.960
Experimentation and data science. I believe the correct adjective was impressed me

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.800
All right, and that and when I was doing that research

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.600
So I'm really good at learning enough about something quickly to fake my way

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.080
I'm the king of fake it till you make it

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.520
But I remember now when I was reading and studying for that stuff

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:25.560
The person when they talked about doing an experiment they talked about being a partnership between the tester and the developer

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.680
But in this case by the tester they met the person designing the test

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.920
Yes, and the test in this case is not the test case input force you what happens

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:41.440
The test is the treatment the different the a the B part of the a B testing

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.560
Yeah, so let me tell you for example

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.600
Like I don't know that the product manager is really the person that does that anymore

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:57.000
It certainly is is not in my experience. I I assign that to like straight out of college

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.480
ICs on my team Oh

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.700
Interesting who partner with straight out of college?

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.600
ICPMs on someone else's thing

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:13.470
Interesting but but those hypotheses range from itty-bitty to huge

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.660
For example, so one of my team

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.500
Worked with a PM on a different team very very recently

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.260
And wanted to understand

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:33.740
So do you know how in some text boxes you can you can put you can put sort of a grayed out text in there

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.500
The kind of guide what goes here and then when they start typing that text goes away. Yeah, exactly

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.170
the control said

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.890
Describe your problem

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:52.900
Okay, they wanted to to test what happened if instead of that in the treatment it said

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:58.040
Briefly describe your problem. Okay, just add in the word briefly

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:06.920
There is a standard set of KPIs that we measured against we basically said. All right, you have the the data you've actually

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:13.440
My IC just basically said this is what we need how you needed to find the experiment

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.920
How you need to split it and we need the data

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.040
Two weeks later. It took that IC 15 minutes to say

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:29.400
Yeah, briefly does literally nothing there's there's no difference between specifying briefly or not

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.640
good example of an A B test, but I need to rewind because my mind is

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.240
blowing

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.320
blowing because

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.760
20 years ago that new at a college tester comes in and is validating that

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.360
If the input box says it takes text it'll take text

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:58.400
Done things like that valid the canonical example making sure the password you can log into the site now

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.240
As we've discussed many times before

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.320
Testing and automated testing especially should be owned by the developer who wants to code

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:14.360
Right. So the tester today does that the that stuff's been validated. So instead the tester today is all about

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:23.340
Testing via data coming with hypotheses around how the software works and and and and what would make it better or worse

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:29.380
Let's let's say better what would make it better and then designing experiments around

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.660
Confirming or disproving those hypotheses. I think that's perfectly reasonable

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.740
But that is it's holy crap and I would bet that there are I mean you're doing this

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.100
This is really cool that you have people do this. This is this is but you don't call these people testers

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.340
What do you call them? I call them data scientists. Nah

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.220
Yeah, wait, is it the profession of data scientists going away?

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.850
That's my prediction. Yeah, and then they go back to being testers or what happens?

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.010
It's a very confusing circle of life here. So

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.490
Well, you'll you'll enjoy this

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.810
Will I so I believe in the industry we're at the beginning of the end of that of the era

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.570
Okay, I'm pretty certain it started before you

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.250
left Microsoft

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.490
Where it's our basically?

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:26.630
What do you call something that repeats every decade? It's it's a cycle

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:34.910
Ten years cycle ten year cycles are perfect. It is about four or five years ago

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:40.550
Someone in HR decided it was time to change the career stage profile

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.350
because things had gotten out of whack and

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:49.470
They started this like five years later and they just finished their current conclusion

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:55.150
Okay, the current iteration and I'm like, oh my god, this is already invalid

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.350
so they're they're creating a

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:05.590
They're creating a whole dev track. The test track is gone. Okay, but there is a dev track

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.510
There is an analytics track and there is a data science track

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.550
And there is also a data engineering track

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.320
Those those last

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.240
What's the I don't know what I know of course there are differences but

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.400
Uh, I so data engineering versus the other two that one's easy. It's right

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.320
Make the data right make it flow sure right and

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.680
Correct and keep it complete

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:42.240
But i'll let you finish and then i'm gonna rant in terms of people doing work in data science space

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:50.170
Based on my current reading of the other three, which is dev data scientists in and analysis

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.720
I really

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.000
cannot figure out

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.070
the difference

00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:01.950
Right. I look at them and i'm like, okay, so if I write code that

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.230
uses data science apis

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.840
Which one of those am I?

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.560
It shouldn't matter because some people are going to live in the middle of two of them and then it gets really hard

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.420
So a little bit of a rant here and I can do this because I worked extensively

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.840
On the version you just retired or about to retire

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.120
And also had I guess not much involvement in what we have at my current employer

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.960
But my experience is what happened with the original we had ladder levels then we had

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.120
Something else and then something else in this new thing brent described

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.680
So the first something else we had

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.160
Was far too specific

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:44.300
That the descriptions are long and what happens when you had you're too specific

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.440
is

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.480
People use them as a checklist they go. Okay. I did that did that did that did that please promote me

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.480
Yeah, that was that was absolutely horrible. That was horrible

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.840
Let me let me finish

00:30:59.160 --> 00:30:59.800
then

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.360
The new ones still a little bit but less there was some overlap we made sure that

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.400
It felt calibrated between disciplines

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.440
But there was still a lot of like what do you call my accelerant role was I was on the test track

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:19.880
But nothing I did was testing. So it was weird again too specific test architect is what you called it. Ellen

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.240
Well, I I did not come up with the title

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.120
Okay, I didn't invent that one

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.560
All right. All right. So what happens is let me tell you where I work now

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.870
uh, we have

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.580
two

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:42.460
Career the ladder levels over there called here. Um job job profiles job architecture. We have two across the entire company

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.760
technical and non-technical

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:47.710
ooh

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:53.630
They're at they're abstract, but they're close they're close enough and there's four areas for each market to go into them and reveal any super secrets

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.110
But what that leaves is a little bit of a disadvantage is it is a lot of interpretation?

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:04.270
That the manager has to do to figure it out. But my argument is that's actually good

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.960
There's a lot of pushes to go. I need to develop a

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.680
A version of this just for software engineers or just for program management or just blah blah

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.920
But they generally on a small team. It's fine. If you can help explain that

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.400
You're just going to get your thoughts down. But what I've found is the more abstract

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.830
Principle one that can't be used as a checklist but can be used to differentiate between levels

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:34.670
Actually works much much better than the more detailed ones. I saw at microsoft two of them technical non-technical

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.450
Done. Okay. Yeah, I don't like non-technical

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:45.870
It seemed because it it it there was a I'm sorry. There's there's there's three and then there's management

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.070
Okay. Yeah, and that would be the right

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:56.030
Right now you look at that and I go technical non-technical and management like to me. It almost sounds like it put a stack order

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:03.710
Technical like the useful people are at the top technical down to the useless ones, which is management

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.350
It reminds me of an event I was at

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.870
I never told you this actually so I had an event

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:17.790
Uh, it was one of these back prior to covet where we actually would be do forced manager training in a room

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.750
with other people and we would meet new people

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.070
and um

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.080
I met

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.160
the former drummer of death cab for cutie because

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.280
He works for microsoft now in xbox studios as an artist

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.880
Oh cool

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.680
And I think based on my conversation with him

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.740
I don't think he'd like being classified as non-technical

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.610
But like it would be better to be classified as something

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.870
Pro something like to be clear. There's

00:33:52.510 --> 00:34:00.110
A lot of people call expert test to call testing. There's technical testing and non-technical testing, which is crap, right?

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.550
But that's that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the difference between

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.110
marketing

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.770
And development we call marketing non-technical

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.080
Yeah, why don't we just call them?

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.120
Sales or or something right that sales and marketing are different things, right?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.560
No, no, no, but there's got to be a broader name for then non-technical

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.480
technical and

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.480
Creed, I don't know technical

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.560
Important technical and actually makes us money on the dev work. We do. I don't know

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.160
But I I get what you're saying that this non-technical label is

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:40.560
Practically offensive in some cases. So I get that. All right, let's go back to let's go back rewind rewind

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.080
If you were a tester today, how would you approach it?

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.640
We went too far back because

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.680
Okay

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.680
All right. So you said

00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.960
You had you said something along the lines that you had your mind blown and oh my because I approached testing today by

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.440
calling testing I would approach testing today as

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.760
Experimentation and assessing quality via hypothesis based on customer data

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.520
Yeah, I was looking at it like I have over on

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.780
A different screen than the one where your camera is on

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:28.380
I have the mt principles and and if today the job is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.520
the world we entered into

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.960
maybe was accelerate the

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.860
Achievement of required correctness

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.400
Hmm

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.080
That sounds dumb

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.520
It does sound dumb and that's probably mostly because it was dumb. No. Yeah. Okay

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.960
We're on the same page. I think if I were coming into a test or if I were managing a new

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.960
tester team

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.560
Today it definitely is going to be focused on

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.520
quality and not correctness

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.520
Yes

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.360
So

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.360
I

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.720
I

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.770
I

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.450
So here's where my mind is because ab testing is still testing

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.850
No, that's actually what i'm thinking. Alan i'm like in the software world

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:27.130
Right now we talk about modern testing is not very modern and not about testing

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.770
Yeah, okay, and we operate a podcast called ab testing we do

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.490
What if if I were to tell you

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:39.370
In season two of the ab testing is coming up after this cliffhanger

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.650
No, what if I were to tell you

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.330
F the old definition of testing

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.480
this

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.520
is

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.480
about

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.840
Modern and it is about testing

00:36:54.810 --> 00:37:00.730
But it's today's definition of we are gonna piss off so many people while we change the world

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.360
Yeah, ab testing it's official. It is modern and it is about testing screw y'all

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.440
Yeah

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.000
No, I think we have to go through the principles and say okay with that definition of testing

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.040
What is missing?

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.360
Because i'll tell you right now there is an

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.220
there number seven

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.220
Yeah, no, they change

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.700
Number seven absolutely changes. I think expanding it the know-how

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.580
I mean that's that's what i'm working on right now

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.270
The I have now gone through so many freaking experiment designs

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.070
I'm now at a point. Oh, oh my god

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:44.670
Why do these people keep coming to me the the mistakes they keep making are so easy. They could just stop

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:52.350
Right. I'm i'm now at a point where i'm getting prepared to automate this which is what i've done my whole career as as have you

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.040
Just the boring parts

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.000
In retrospective, that means my life has been very boring

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.400
I think season two of ab testing coming up here

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.840
Maybe we maybe we really messed and put the slash in our podcast title

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.710
Okay

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:15.310
Yeah, that's interesting. There's some exploration to do here. So I didn't and here's the fun

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:20.910
Here's what you get to hear as a listener all three of you of ab testing

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.300
I didn't know where this was going that my

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.340
My approach in thinking about how to answer this question of if I were a tester day

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.300
How would I approach it? Let's try and think about the different kinds of testing

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.380
I've done

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.820
And how quickly I evolved out of actually doing testing yet somehow

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.140
Knowing something about it, but we we made a shift here, which is

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.200
It's what stephen johnson in where good ideas comes from is called the adjacent possible

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:54.840
It was there it was there to be noticed. It just took us talking for us to notice it

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.060
Yeah, and it's interesting. It was it was there. It was there all the time

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.180
It has been absolutely we we've just been

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.860
And and we've we've talked around it

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.980
like for years it just never

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.510
it's like we're

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:21.230
We're at a party and we keep refusing to make eye contact with this one thing because so we don't even notice that they're there and then suddenly like

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.110
Oh, you've been here the whole time

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.470
Testing I am staring at you and fluttering my eyes

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.720
Hey ab testing

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:39.520
What's your side let's go get a beer together it's too much of a random tangent maybe even even for our podcast

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:46.000
Almost impossible long time listeners will know it's pretty much impossible to out tangent

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.760
The a slash be testing podcast. Oh, I you're really gonna stick with that, huh? Just for now

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.480
I don't know what's gonna happen, man. I don't know what's gonna happen

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.120
On season two of the ab testing podcast. Sorry on season two

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.200
So let's be testing podcast. We still got a few minutes left. Let's go through this

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.360
All right, man. I'm win. All right. I just got excited. Sorry, man. I'm gonna reel it back

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.480
So we're going to define modern testing

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.480
like testing

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.440
now

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.560
In the the the span of the next few minutes testing

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.280
is talking about

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.000
ab testing experiment design

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:31.240
And the thing that i'm just i'm like, yeah shippable quality quality. It's about quality. That's what ab testing

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.090
Oh my god

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.930
The thing I really like about ab testing is because it's about

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:45.130
Quality versus the other testing craft is about correctness old testing not modern testing

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:51.450
Now we don't have to do modern and traditional we can actually do modern and old. Yeah, I was I was thinking

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.260
Could we get away with

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.420
calling it old

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.940
And just testing like remove our adjective and put it on the other put the adjective

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.900
on the other one

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:12.620
traditional or like I've been calling it traditional but I now want to turn that makes it sound like it's archaic

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.400
ab testing our

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.520
Uh, our priority is improving the business

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:23.210
Absolutely. That sounds good. I don't know if it's really

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.130
well

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:29.450
I was like, you know, we put that in some more homework on these and but yeah

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.730
There are new principles because it's a new we're actually talking about modern testing

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:40.890
It is modern and it is about testing right? I'm changing the website in 15 minutes

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.590
So so for that one

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:51.390
The I think the priority is improving the business but unlike when we when we originally did this we put that in there

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.840
Because like I remember why I wanted that in there and why I wanted it as number one

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.600
Is because so much of the traditional testers were

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.120
We're just like I I provided information or I do what I told or I do this

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.200
I'm like I provide information to stakeholders so they can make the hard decisions

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.840
Right and we're like no cut that crap out be a part

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.280
Be an active part of improving the business

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.360
Not not some dead weight that someone can cut at any time

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.480
We accelerate the team and use models like

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.680
I don't know. That's not part of the new modern testing. I don't think it is

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.040
And even number so I think one five and six

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.080
So the customer is only capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:45.040
That's a new modern testing principle as well as we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and close the gap stream product

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.240
Hypothesis and business impact. That's a new modern testing principle

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.000
Yeah, you could you could almost argue six could be removed because we're kind of saying

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.880
Six is modern testing. Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna take a little bit of work here. I do want to make one little psa. So

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.200
Uh, just so you all know brent is click training himself

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:11.600
So if you hear a little clicky clicky sound in the back that is brent teaching himself how to not salivate when hearing good ideas

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.320
Yeah, so when I have a good idea

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.120
the small

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.040
Mostly non-functional but sometimes functional, uh

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.800
Resistance to annoy alan just dissipates

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.280
It's like okay

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.840
No, must put crunchy things down must hit mute if i'm gonna cough must

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.520
All of alan's rules that you've heard him

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.200
over the years

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.800
I can you know, I cut your coughs and and clearing throats things out of the podcast all the time

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.040
But it's when you're clicking when you talk

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:52.000
I can't I do not have the time to go in and edit out the clicks while leaving your voice in place

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.520
It is not worth it. So they're gonna be there. But wait a minute. You're saying you could do that though

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.400
I could I could I could do that. Okay fair enough. All right. I'm not gonna

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.020
too much effort

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.420
Yeah, so several things would need to change for sure

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.280
But I like this direction

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.280
And I like it too because

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:18.440
Now if we do this I have to go back and restudy all those things that I learned once and you all know like it

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:25.240
Oh, you know what? I should go back and look at the presentation. I gave at like agile dev in las vegas in

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.060
2017 or so where I gave a talk on experimentation

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.200
Did you know that brent?

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.840
Yes, I give like a workshop on experimentation. No, I know

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.280
Because this is where I I I you vetted it here

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:45.600
I know because this is what I do. I learned enough to give a presentation people to be happy. It was like a fill-in like

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.680
Don't have a speaker. Can you come to vegas? I said yeah, i'll come for the day

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.680
I said no you have to spend the night. I'm not okay

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:58.640
I'm not entirely certain you should be so proud of yourself being a masterful bullshitter, but you know, whatever

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.090
Someone's a little jelly

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.760
So no, I want to relearn this stuff. So I will I will put my no with that with that light of mine

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.960
Talking about it. Yeah, this is so cool. We have a topic for the next podcast

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.960
Two weeks before we're even going to record it

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.930
We often do that. The question is often

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.090
We do

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:25.450
The question is is will we actually remember? No, I think we will this is big news. This is big news

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.890
We're talking about season two of the a b testing podcast. Yeah

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.730
It's freaking funny as well. You're like, hey

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.730
What if we took the concept of modern testing?

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:41.050
And combined it with the concept of a b testing

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:44.650
Who could have come up with that idea?

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:54.110
I just can't wait to chase the tail line too. It it it is modern damn it and it is about testing now. Shut up

00:45:54.750 --> 00:46:01.790
Yeah, it'll at least at least the hate letters will be something new right? You know, I yes

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:07.070
And we love the anyways give us things to talk about and every we we love for you to hate us

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.830
I was just thinking no, I was just trying to

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:16.110
I was trying to guess what the if we came out with that with

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:21.390
With a set of principles that were in fact both modern and about

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:27.550
Testing and I don't know it depends on to what degree we wanted to say

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:34.270
Yeah, we're we're taking the term. We're taking over the term what you call testing this. Yeah

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:40.380
Oh, oh and we can be the ones to say oh, oh, oh my god. Oh my god

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:44.540
I know where you're going. Go ahead. We could be the ones to say well, that's not testing

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.540
Yeah

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.420
Oh

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.660
You you went down a similar path

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:58.170
But not the one we have heard some people say that about testers in the industry where they didn't like them because whatever i'm not

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.250
But they would say what that's not testing. Well, guess what?

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.890
That's not testing either

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.410
No, no

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.410
Yeah, what if we were to say?

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.250
And I would love to be able to say this and back it up

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.470
What is known as traditional testing?

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:18.590
I am proposing that from here on out

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.070
We call it checking

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:27.070
All of it every bit of it your information providing that's all checking all of it all of it

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:31.950
You're playing with the app to see if it works and and plugging in random inputs

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.510
Still checking it's all checking

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:43.390
Let's like let's like if we're gonna take if we're gonna take back the term or if we're gonna take the term testing

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.670
Let's test take take checking as well. Why not? Okay

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.270
We own testing

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.000
All right, I gotta go to my next medium yeah me too. Hey everybody

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:02.440
It's alan and goodbye and that's brent and he says goodbye and we'll talk to you next time on series two episode

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.660
166 of the a slash b testing podcast. Bye. Bye
